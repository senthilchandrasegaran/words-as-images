# Words as Images : A (very brief) workshop on visualizing and exploring text

Jupyter Notebooks accompanying the introduction to computational text analysis given as part of the IDE Academy on visualizing text data at the Industrial Design Engineering Master's Programme at TU Delft.

#### Note:
Notebooks currently have minimal explanation as this is a work in progress and meant to accompany the lecture presentations.

This content is a modification of the 1-day workshop on [Computational Text Analysis](https://github.com/senthilchandrasegaran/computational-text-analysis-2023), which is in turn based on the excellent publicly-available repository on [Computational Text Analysis for Humanists and Social Scientists](https://github.com/lknelson/text-analysis-2017/) by [Dr. Laura K. Nelson](https://www.lauraknelson.com/).
