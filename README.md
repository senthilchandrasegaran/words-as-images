# Computational text analysis for library data: 2024

Jupyter Notebooks accompanying the introduction to text visualization given as part of the IDE Academy on visualizing library data at the Industrial Design Engineering Master's Programme at TU Delft.

#### Note:
Notebooks currently have minimal explanation as this is a work in progress and meant to accompany the lecture presentations.

This content is a modification of the 1-day workshop on [Computational Text Analysis](https://github.com/senthilchandrasegaran/computational-text-analysis-2023), which is in turn based on the excellent publicly-available repository on [Computational Text Analysis for Humanists and Social Scientists](https://github.com/lknelson/text-analysis-2017/) by [Dr. Laura K. Nelson](https://www.lauraknelson.com/).
