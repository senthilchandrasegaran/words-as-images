No book of this kind will sell without receipts for the rich articles which custom requires, and in furnishing them, the writer has aimed to follow the example of Providence, which scatters profusely both good and ill, and combines therewith the caution alike of experience, revelation, and conscience, "choose ye that which is good, that ye and your seed may live."</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sixth,</emph> in the work on Domestic Economy, together with<pb n="preface" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=15"/>this, to which it is a Supplement, the writer has attempted to secure in a cheap and popular form, for American housekeepers, a work similar to an English work which she has examined, entitled the <emph rend="italic">Encyclop&#230;dia of Domestic Economy, by Thomas Webster and Mrs. Parkes,</emph> containing over twelve hundred octavo pages of closely-printed matter, treating on every department of Domestic Economy ; a work which will be found much more useful to English women, who have a plenty of money and well-trained servants, than to American housekeepers. It is believed that most, in that work, which would be of any practical use to American housekeepers, will be found in this work and the Domestic Economy.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Lastly,</emph> the writer has aimed to avoid the defects complained of by most housekeepers in regard to works of this description, issued in this country, or sent from England, such as that, in some cases, the receipts are so rich as to be both expensive and unhealthful ; in others, that they are so vaguely expressed as to be very imperfect guides ; in others, that the processes are so elaborate and <emph rend="italic">fussing</emph> as to make double the work that is needful ; and in others, that the topics are so limited that some departments are entirely omitted, and all are incomplete.</p><p>In accomplishing these objects, the writer has received contributions of the pen, and verbal communications, from some of the most judicious and practical housekeepers, in almost every section of this country.</p></div>

Pereira. Edited by Dr. Charles A. Lee."</emph> "The author of this work," says Dr. Lee, "is well known throughout Europe and America, as one of the most learned, scientific, and practical men of the age ;- a physician of great experience and accurate observation, and a highly successful writer. To the medical profession he is most favorably known as the author of the best work on the Materia Medica which has appeared in our language."</p><p>This work contains the principles discovered by Leibig, D&#251;mas, and Brossingault, and applies them practically to the subject of the proper selection of food. All the opinions, expressed in what follows, are sanctioned by the above work, by Dr. Combe, and by most of the distinguished practitioners of our age and country.</p><p>In selecting food, with reference to health, the following principles must be borne in mind.</p><p>First, that there are <emph rend="italic">general rules</emph> in regard to healthful food and drink, which have been established, not by a few, but by thousands and thousands of experiments, through many ages, and in an immense variety of circumstances. It is these <emph rend="italic">great principles,</emph> which must<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=27"/>be the main dependance of every mother and housekeeper, to guide her in selecting healthful food and drink for her children and family. These rules are furnished by medical writers and practitioners.</p><p>Secondly, there are occasional exceptions to these general rules, and when such occur, two errors should be avoided. One is, giving up all confidence in the deductions of a wide experience, established by extensive experiments, and assuming that we have no rules at all and that every person must follow the guidance of mere appetite, or his own limited experience. The other is making the exception into a general rule, and maintaining that every person must conform to it.</p><p>For example, it is found by general experience, that milk is a very safe and healthful article of food, and that alcoholic drinks are very unhealthful. But there are cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule ; for some children never can eat milk without being made sick and there are cases known where men have lived to a very advanced age and in perfect health, who have daily used alcoholic drinks, even to the point of intoxication.</p><p>Still, it is very unwise to throw away the general rule and say, that it is just as well for children to drink alcoholic drinks as to use milk, -and as unwise to claim that every person must give up the use of milk because a few are injured by it.</p><p>The true method is, to take the general rules obtained by abundant experience for our guide, and when any exceptions are found, to regard them as <emph rend="italic">exceptions</emph> which do not vacate the general rule, nor make it needful to conform all other cases to this exception.</p>
<p>It will be the object of what follows, to point out the <emph rend="italic">general rules,</emph> which are to regulate in the selection of drinks and diet, leaving it to each individual to ascertain, by experiments, what are, and what are not the exceptions.</p><p>In the first place, then, it is a general rule that man needs a <emph rend="italic">variety</emph> of ailment, so that it is unfavorable to health to be confined to only one kind of food.</p><p>The various textures of the human body are composed<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=28"/>of chemical compounds, which differ from each other, both as to ingredients, and as to modes of combination. It is true, that every portion of the body may be resolved to a few simple elements, of which oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen are the chief. But the bodily organs have not the power of forming all the various animal tissues from these simple elements. Instead of this, they must be introduced into the body in various complex and different combinations, as they exist in the forms of gluten, fibrine, albumen, caseine, and other animal and vegetable compounds.</p><p>Thus the sugar, starch, and oils, found in certain kinds of food, supply the carbon which sustain the combustion ever carried on in the lungs by the process of breathing, and which is the grand source of animal heat. On the contrary, the blood, muscles, skin, cartilages, and other parts of the body, are daily nourished and renewed, some by the <emph rend="italic">gluten</emph> contained in wheat, others by the <emph rend="italic">albumen</emph> of eggs, others by the <emph rend="italic">caseine</emph> of milk, and others by the <emph rend="italic">fibrine</emph> of animals. All these are found in a great variety of articles used as food. When received into the stomach, the organs of digestion and assimilation prepare, and then carry them, each to its own appropriate organ, and then the excreting organs throw off the surplus.</p><p>In order, then, to have every portion of the body properly developed, it is necessary to take such a variety of food, that from one source or another, every organ of the body shall be sustained by its appropriate nourishment. The experiments which prove this, have been conducted on a great scale, and the method and results are detailed in the work of Dr. Pereira.</p><p>This fact exhibits one cause of the craving, sometimes felt for certain kinds of food, which usually is the call of nature for some ingredient, that the daily round of aliment does not supply. The statistics furnished in the work of Dr. Pereira, from various armies, prisons, alms-houses, and asylums, show, that, where many hundreds are fed on the same diet, the general health of the multitude is better sustained by a considerable variety and<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=29"/>occasional changes, than by a more restricted selection. Experiments on dogs and other animals, also, have been tried on a large scale, which prove that there is <emph rend="italic">no</emph> kind of food, which, alone, will preserve full and perfect health ; while every kind (except the food containing <emph rend="italic">gluten,</emph> which is the chief ingredient of wheat and other breadstuffs), when given exclusively, eventually destroys life. The exclusive use of wheat bread and potatoes, as found by experiment, will sustain life and health more perfectly, for a great length of time, than any other kinds of food.</p><p>The above fact is a striking exhibition of the beneficence of Providence, in providing such an immense variety of articles of food. And no less so is the instinct of appetite, which demands not only a variety, but is wearied with one unchanging round.</p><p>Having ascertained that it is needful to health, that a due variety of food should be secured, we next proceed to examine the principles that are to guide us in the selection.</p><p>It is found that the articles used for food and drink may be arranged in the following classes:-</p><p>First, articles that furnish no other stimulation to the animal functions than is secured by the fresh supply of nutrition. All food that nourishes the body, in one sense, may be called stimulating, inasmuch as it imparts renewed energies to the various bodily functions. In this sense even bread is a stimulant. But the more common idea attached to the word stimulant is, that it is a principle which imparts a speed and energy to the organs of the system above the ordinary point secured by perfect and appropriate nourishment. The first class, then, are those articles that serve to nourish and develop perfectly every animal function, but do not increase the strength and speed of organic action above the point of full nourishment. The bread-stuffs, vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, acid drinks, and water are of this class.</p><p>Secondly, those articles, which serve to nourish perfectly all the animal system, and at the same time increase the strength and speed of all functional action. <pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=30"/>All animal food is of this class. All physiologists and medical men agree in the fact, that the pulse and all the organs of the body, are not only nourished, but are quickened in action by animal food, while speed and force are reduced by confining the diet to farinaceous, vegetable, and fruit diet.</p><p>Thirdly, those articles which impart no nourishment at all to the body, but act solely to stimulate all the organs to preternatural action. Alcoholic drinks, condiments, and aromatic oils are of this description.</p><p>Fourthly, articles that are neither nourishing nor stimulating, but pass out of the system entirely undigested and unassimilated. The bran of coarse bread is an example.</p><p>Fifthly, articles that, either from their nature or modes of combination and cooking, are difficult of digestion, unhealthful, and, of course, tend to weaken the organic powers by excessive or unnatural action. Animal oils, either cooked or rancid, and many articles badly cooked, are of this kind.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">NOURISHING AND UNSTIMULATING FOOD.</hd><p>The following presents a list of the articles which are found to be healthful and nourishing, and not stimulating, except as they supply the nourishment needed by the various bodily functions.</p><p>The first and most important of these are called the <emph rend="italic">farinaceous</emph> substances. Of these, wheat stands at the head, as the most nutritive, safe, and acceptable diet to all classes and in all circumstances. This can be used in the form of bread, every day, through a whole life, without cloying the appetite, and to an extent which can be said of no other food.</p><p>Wheat is prepared in several forms, the principal of which are the common Fine Wheat Flour, the Unbolted, or Graham Flour, and Macaroni, Vermicelli, and Cagliari Pastes. The last are flour paste prepared, or cut into various shapes and dried.</p><p>Wheat flour is made into bread of two kinds, the fermented,<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=31"/>or spongy breads, and the unfermented, or hard breads.</p><p>The spongy breads are made by using either yeast, or the combination of an acid and alkali. In yeast bread, the fermentation of the particles of diffused yeast evolve carbonic acid. This expands the flour in a spongy form, in which it is retained by the tenacity of the gluten of the flour, until baking hardens it. Corn meal and some other bread-stuffs cannot be raised thus, because they do not contain gluten sufficient to hold the carbonic acid as it evolves.</p><p>When an alkali and acid are used to raise bread, their combination evolves carbonic acid by a more sudden process than the yeast fermentation. The lightness produced by eggs is owing to their adhesive porosity when beaten and mixed with flour and baked.</p><p>Bread is also made of rice, rye, Indian meal, and barley. These varieties of bread-stuffs are useful in various ways. In cases when persons are troubled with looseness of bowels, rice bread, rice gruel, and rice water for drink, prevent the necessity of resorting to medicine. In cases where the opposite difficulty exists, a diet of unbolted wheat, or rye mush with salt and molasses will remedy the evil. These articles also can, all of them, be formed into a great variety of combinations that are at once healthful, and acceptable to the palate.</p><p>The next class of healthful and unstimulating articles are the <emph rend="italic">amylaceous,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">starchy</emph> articles of diet. Of these Sago, Tapioca, Arrow Root, and the Lichens, are those in most frequent use. These are nourishing and remarkably easy of digestion. They are very much used for invalids, and for young children when first weaned.</p><p>The next most valuable articles of food are the <emph rend="italic">vegetables.</emph> Of these the Potato is at once the most healthful, and most universally relished. In the form of Starch, it makes, when cooked, a light and agreeable article for the sick, and is convenient to housekeepers as forming a fine <emph rend="italic">minute pudding</emph> to meet an emergency.</p><p>Of the great variety of vegetables that are furnished at market, or from our gardens, almost all are palatable<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=32"/>and healthful to a stomach that is strong. Peas, Beans, Onions, and cooked Cabbage and Turnips, usually are not good for persons whose powers of digestion have been weakened.</p><p>The next most valuable articles of food are <emph rend="italic">the Fruits.</emph> Almost all kinds of fruit, <emph rend="italic">when fully ripe,</emph> are healthful to those who are not suffering from weakness of digestion. Grapes, Apples, Peaches, Strawberries, Raspberries, and Currants, are least likely to prove injurious. The skins and seeds of all fruits consist of woody matter, that is perfectly undigestible, and should never be taken in large quantities. It is the skins and seeds of the grape that make raisins so often injurious to young children. If the skins and stones can be removed, nothing can be found that is more safe and healthful, in moderate quantities, than raisins and grapes.</p><p>The next articles of healthful unstimulating food are the <emph rend="italic">Saccharine substances,</emph> Sugar, Molasses, and Honey. On this point, Dr. Pereira remarks, "The injurious effects which have been ascribed to sugar are more imaginary than real. The fondness of children for saccharine substances may be regarded as a natural instinct ; since nature, by placing it in the mother's milk, evidently intended it to form a part of their nourishment. Instead, therefore, of repressing this appetite for sugar, it ought rather to be gratified <emph rend="italic">in moderation.</emph> The popular notion, of its having a tendency to injure the teeth, is totally unfounded. During the sugar season of the West Indies, every negro on the plantations, every animal, and even the dogs, grow fat. And no people on earth have finer teeth than the negroes of Jamaica. It is probable that this erroneous notion has been propagated by frugal housewives, in order to deter children from indulging in an expensive luxury. Sugar is readily digested by a healthy stomach. In dyspeptics, it is apt to give rise to flatulence and acidity of stomach."</p><p>These remarks, without other considerations, may lead to erroneous conclusions. There is no doubt that both children and adults are often injured by the use of sugar, but it is not because it is unhealthful in its nature, but<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=33"/>because it is used in excess or in an improper manner. In the "Domestic Economy," pg. 105, it is shown that <emph rend="italic">highly concentrated</emph> food is not favorable to digestion, because it cannot be properly acted on by the muscular contractions of the stomach, and is not so minutely divided as to enable the gastric juice to act properly. Now Sugar, Candy, and the like, are highly concentrated nourishment, and should not be used except when mixed with other food. The reason, then, why children are injured by sugar is, that they eat it too frequently, in too large quantities, and unmixed with other food. A stick or two of pure candy, eaten with crackers or bread, never would injure any healthy child. It is too often the case, that candies are mixed with unhealthful coloring matter, or with nuts and other oily substances, that make them injurious.</p><p>The next article of healthful, unstimulating food, is <emph rend="italic">jellies</emph> and <emph rend="italic">preseved fruits.</emph> As it has been shown that uncooked fruits and sugar are both healthful, it may not seem surprising that jellies and fruits cooked in sugar, when eaten moderately, with bread or crackers, are regarded as among the most nourishing and healthful of all aliments. When they prove injurious, it is owing either to the fact that they are taken alone, or with rich cream, or else are taken in too great quantities. Eaten moderately, as a part of a meal, they are safe and nourishing to all, except persons of poor digestion. Healthful stomachs need not be governed by rules demanded by the invalid, which has too often been attempted.</p><p>The preceding presents a vast variety of articles suitable for food, containing in abundance all the principles demanded for the perfect development of all the animal functions, and which physiologists and medical men unitedly allow to be healthful. These can be combined by the cook in an endless variety of agreeable dishes, involving no risk to a healthful stomach, when taken in proper quantities and in a proper time and manner.</p></section>
<section><pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=34"/><hd align="center">NOURISHING AND STIMULATING FOOD.</hd><p>The second general division of food, embraces articles which serve perfectly to nourish and develop every animal organ, but, at the same time, increase the speed and strength of all functional action beyond the point which is attained by the system, when fully and perfectly nourished by vegetables, fruits, and bread-stuffs. There is no dispute among physiologists and physicians as to the fact, that animal food produces chyle which is more stimulating to the various organs, than that which is formed from an exclusive vegetable diet. The only question debated is, whether this increase of stimulus is favorable, or unfavorable to health and long life.</p><p>Those who maintain that it is unfavorable, say, that all other things being equal, that machine must wear out the soonest which works the fastest ; that, it is proved, both by analysis and by facts, that a vegetable diet contains every principle needed for the perfect development of the whole bodily system, as much so as animal food ; and that the only difference is the <emph rend="italic">stimulation</emph> in the animal food, which makes the system work faster, and of course, wear out sooner.</p><p>To this it is replied, that the exact point of stimulation, which is most safe and healthful, cannot be determined, and that it is as correct to assume, that to be the proper medium, which is secured by a mixed diet, as to assume that the proper point is that, which is secured by an exclusive vegetable diet. Moreover, the fact that the teeth and digestive organs of man, which seem to be fitted both for vegetable and animal food, and the fact that the supplies of food on the earth make it needful to adopt sometimes animal, and sometimes vegetable diet, and sometimes a mixture of both, furnish an <emph rend="italic">&#224; priori</emph> argument in favor of a mixed diet.</p><p>In deciding which kinds of animal food are most healthful, several particulars are to be regarded. The flesh of young animals is more tender than that of the old ones, but yet they usually are not so easily digested. Beef, and Mutton, and Venison, when tender, are considered<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=35"/>the meats which are most easily digested, and best for weak stomachs. Venison is more stimulating than Beef and Mutton. These meats, when tough, are not so easily digested as when tender.</p><p>All meats are made more tender and digestible by hanging.</p><p>Solid meats, properly cooked, are more easily digested than soups and broths. For it is found that these liquids are never digested till the water is absorbed, leaving a solid mass more undigestible than was the solid meat. When useful to invalids, it is because they supply the loss of the withdrawn fluids of the body, but not because more easily digested. The white meats, such as Chicken and Veal, are best for invalids, because less stimulating than dark meats.</p><p>Liver contains so much oil that it is not good for invalids or dyspeptics.</p><p>The digestibility and healthfulness of meat depends very much upon the mode of cooking. Boiled meats are most easily digested, when <emph rend="italic">properly</emph> boiled. Roasting, broiling, and baking, are healthful modes of cooking, but <emph rend="italic">frying</emph> is a very pernicious mode of preparing meats, the reason of which will be explained hereafter.</p><p>Though there is a disagreement of opinion among practitioners and physiologists, as to the propriety of using any animal food, they are all agreed in regard to certain general principles that should regulate its use. They are as follows:-Less animal food should be used in warm climates than in cold, and less, also, in summer than in winter. The reason of this is, that heat is stimulating to the system, and as meat diet is also stimulating, when heat increases, meat, as a diet, should decrease, or fevers may ensue.</p><p>Another principle is, that the proportions of meat diet should depend somewhat on the constitution and circumstances. When a person is of full habit, or inclined to inflammatory attacks of any kind, the proportion of animal food should be much less than in other cases.</p><p>On the contrary, when there is a state of the system<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=36"/>that demands gentle stimulus, an increase of meat diet is sometimes useful.</p><p>Persons subject to cutaneous eruptions are sometimes entirely cured by <emph rend="italic">long</emph> abstinence from animal food, and all kinds of oily substances.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">FOOD THAT STIMULATES WITHOUT NOURISHING.</hd><p>The articles which come under this head, are usually called <emph rend="italic">the condiments.</emph> In regard to these, Dr. Pereira remarks,-</p><p>"The relish for flavoring, or seasoning ingredients, manifested by almost every person, would lead us to suppose that these substances serve some useful purpose beyond that of merely gratifying the palate. At present, however, we have no evidence that they do. They stimulate, but do not seem to nourish. The volatile oil they contain is absorbed, and then thrown out of the system, still possessing its characteristic odor."</p><p>The articles used for food of this kind, are the <emph rend="italic">sweet herbs</emph> employed for seasoning, such as Thyme, Summer Savory, and the like, and the <emph rend="italic">spices</emph>, such as Cloves, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Ginger. Mustard, Horseradish, Water Cresses, Garlic, and Onions, contain these stimulating oils, combined with some nourishing food.</p><p>"Condiments," says Dr. Beaumont, "particularly those of a spicy kind, are non-essential to the process of digestion in a healthy state of the system. They afford no nutrition. Though they may assist the action of a debilitate stomach for a time, their continual use never fails to produce an indirect debility of that organ. They affect it as alcohol and other stimulants do- the <emph rend="italic">present</emph> relief afforded is at the expense of <emph rend="italic">future</emph> suffering. Salt and Vinegar are exceptions when used in moderation. They both assist in digestion, Vinegar by rendering muscular fibre more tender, and both together, by producing a fluid having some analogy to the gastric juice."</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">FOOD THAT IS ENTIRELY UNDIGESTIBLE.</hd><p>There is no kind of food used which consists exclusively of indigestible matter. But it often is the case,<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=37"/>that a certain amount of indigestible matter is mixed with nourishing food, and serves, by its mechanical aid, to promote the healthful action of the stomach and bowels. This is the reason why unbolted flour is deemed more healthful than fine flour, and is consequently preferred for dyspeptics. But where there is too great a quantity of such indigestible matter, or where it is not properly combined with digestible food, it proves injurious and often dangerous. This is the case when the skins and seeds of fruits are swallowed, which always pass off entirely undigested.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">FOOD THAT IS UNHEALTHFUL IN NATURE, OR MADE SO BY COOKING.</hd><p>The most injurious food, of any in common use, is the <emph rend="italic">animal oils,</emph> and articles cooked with them. On this subject, Dr. Pereira remarks:-"<emph rend="italic">Fixed oil,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">fat</emph>, is more difficult of digestion, and more obnoxious to the stomach, than any other alimentary principle. Indeed, in concealed forms, I believe it will be found to be the offending ingredient in nine-tenths of the dishes which disturb weak stomachs. Many dyspeptics who avoid fat meat, butter, and oil, unwittingly eat it in some concealed form. Liver, the yolk of eggs, and brains, such individuals should eschew, as they abound in oily matter."</p><p>"The influence of heat on fatty substances effects chemical changes, whereby they are rendered more difficult of digestion, and more obnoxious to the stomach. Hence those culinary operations in which fat or oil is subjected to high temperatures, are objectionable."</p><p>"Fixed oils give off, while boiling, carbonic acid, an inflammable vapor, and an acrid oil, called Acroleon, while the fatty acids of the oil are, in part, set free. It has always appeared to me that cooked butter proves more obnoxious to the stomach than cooked <emph rend="italic">Olive</emph> oil. This I ascribe to the facility with which, under the influence of heat, the acrid, volatile acids of butter are set free. The fat of salt pork and bacon is less injurious to some<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=38"/>dyspeptics than fresh animal fats. This must depend on some change effected by curing."</p><p>"In many dyspeptics, fat does not become properly chymified. It floats on the stomach in the form of an oily pellicle, becoming odorous, and sometimes highly rancid, and in this state excites heartburn, disagreeable nausea, eructations, and sometimes vomiting. It appears to me, that the greater tendency which some oily substances have than others to disturb the stomach, depends on the greater facility with which they evolve volatile, fatty acids, which are for the most part exceedingly acrid and irritating. The distressing feelings excited in many dyspeptics by mutton fat, butter, and fish oils, are, in this way, readily accounted for. Butter contains no less than three volatile, fatty acids, namely--the butyric, capric, and capr&#246;ic. Fats, by exposure to the air, become rancid, and in this state are <emph rend="italic">exceedingly</emph> obnoxious to the digestive organs. Their injurious qualities depend on the presence of volatile acids, and in part also on non-acid substances."</p><p>These statements show the reasons why the <emph rend="italic">fried</emph> food of all kinds is injurious. Fat is an unhealthful aliment, and when heated becomes still more so. This mode of cooking, then, should be given up by every housekeeper, who intends to take all reasonable means of preserving the health of her family. There are an abundance of other modes of preparing food, without resorting to one which involves danger, especially to children and invalids, whose powers of digestion are feeble.</p><p>The most common modes of preparing unhealthful food, is by frying food, and by furnishing <emph rend="italic">bread that is heavy, or sour, or so newly baked,</emph> as to become clammy and indigestible when chewed. Though there are many stomachs that can for a long time take such food without trouble, it always is injurious to weak stomachs, and often renders a healthful stomach a weak one. A housekeeper that will always keep a supply of sweet, light bread on her table, and avoid oily dishes, oily cooking, and condiments, will double the chances of good health for her family.</p><pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=39"/><p>Minuteness of division is a great aid to easy digestion. For this reason food should be well chewed before swallowing, not only to divide it minutely, but to mix it with the saliva, which aids in digestion.</p><p>The cooking of food, in most cases, does not alter its nature ; it only renders it more tender, and thus more easily divided and digested.</p> <p>When a person is feverish and loathes food, it should never be given, as the stomach has not sufficient gastric juice to secure its digestion. The practice of tempting the sick by favorite articles, should therefore be avoided.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">LIQUID ALIMENTS, OR DRINKS.</hd><p><emph rend="italic">"Water,"</emph> says Dr. Pereira, "is probably the natural drink of all adults. It serves several important purposes in the animal economy:-firstly, it repairs the loss of the aqueous part of the blood, caused by evaporation, and the action of the secreting and exhaling organs ; secondly, it is a solvent of various alimentary substances, and, therefore, assists the stomach in digestion, though, if taken in very large quantities, it may have an opposite effect, by diluting the gastric juice ; thirdly, it is a nutritive agent, that is, it assists in the formation of the solid parts of the body."</p><p>The health of communities and of individuals is often affected by the nature of the water used for drink, and it is therefore important to know how to secure pure and good water.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Rain water</emph> is the purest of all water, purer than the best spring water. Of course every person who fears that the water used is the cause of any evil, can obtain that which is known to be pure and good. The cheapest mode of obtaining good rain water, is to have a large cistern dug in the vicinity of some large building, with conducting spouts. This can be lined with water lime, and the water thus obtained, when cooled with ice, is as pure as any that can be found.</p><p>A distinguished medical writer, Dr. Cheyne, remarking on the effects of foreign substances in water, states these facts:-</p><pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=40"/><p>"At the Nottingham Assizes, July, 1836, it was proved on trial, at which I was a witness, that dysentery, in an aggravated form, was caused in cattle by the use of water contaminated with putrescent vegetable matter, produced by the refuse of a <emph rend="italic">starch</emph> manufactory. The fish were destroyed, and all the animals that drank of this water became seriously ill, and many died. It was shown, also, that the mortality was in proportion to the quantity of starch made at different times, and that when the putrescent matter (of the manufactory) was not allowed to pass to the brook, the fish and frogs returned, and the mortality ceased among the cattle."</p><p>Dr. Barry, an English physician, states, that when the troops at Cork were supplied with water from the river Lee, which, in passing through the city, is rendered unfit for drinking by the influx from sewers, Mr. Bell suspected that a dysentery, prevailing at the time, arose from this cause. Upon assuming the care of the troops, he had a number of water carts to bring water from a spring, and did not allow the use of river water, and very shortly the dysentery disappeared.</p><p>Sir James McGregor states, that, at one time in the Spanish war, when during three months 20,000 dead bodies were interred at Ciudad Rodrigo, all those exposed to emanations from the soil, and who were obliged to use water from sunken wells, were affected by low malignant fevers, or dysenteries.</p><p>This shows that burying in large towns affects the health of the inhabitants, first by emanations from the soil, and secondly by poisoning the water percolating through that soil.</p><p>Many such facts as these, show the importance of keeping wells and cisterns from the drainings of sinks, barn-yards, and from decayed dead animals. And it is probable that much sickness in families and communities has been caused by neglecting to preserve the water pure, that is used for drink and cooking.</p><p>Water is sometimes rendered unhealthful by being conducted through lead pipes, or kept in lead reservoirs, or vessels. It is found that the purer the water, the<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=41"/>more easily it is affected by the lead through which it passes. When the water has certain neutral salts in it, they are deposited on the surface of the lead, and thus protect from its poisonous influence. Immersing a very bright piece of lead for some hours in water, will show whether it is safe to use lead in conducting the water. If the lead is tarnished, it proves that the water exerts a solvent power, and that it is unsafe to employ lead in carrying the water.</p><p>The continued use of water containing lead, gives rise to the <emph rend="italic">lead cholic,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">painter's cholic,</emph> and if the water is still drank, <emph rend="italic">palsy</emph> succeeds. One indication of this disease is a narrow leaden blue line on the edge of the gums of the front teeth.</p><p>The following are methods to be employed in purifying water:--</p><p>The most thorough and effectual way of obtaining perfectly pure water, from that which is noxious, is, to <emph rend="italic">distill</emph> it, collecting only the steam.</p><p>In cases where water is injured by the presence of animal or vegetable matter, <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> sometimes removes much of the evil.</p><p>Two grains of powdered alum to every quart of water, will often serve to remove many impurities.</p><p>Filtering through fine sand and powdered charcoal, removes all animal and vegetable substances which are not held in chemical solution.</p><p>Sea water serves both as a cathartic and emetic, and the only mode of obtaining pure water from it is by distillation.</p><p>The impure water used often at sea, is owing wholly to the <implement>casks</implement> in which it is carried. When new, the water imbibes vegetable ingredients from the <implement>cask,</implement> which become putrid. Water, if carried to sea in iron <implement>casks,</implement> if good and pure, always continues so. Cistern water is often impure, when held in new wooden cisterns, owing to vegetable matter absorbed by the water.</p><p>Dr. Lee remarks, "We are satisfied that impure water is more frequently the cause of disease than is generally supposed. It has been thought that decaying<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=42"/>vegetable matter, received into the stomach, was innoxious, owing to the antiseptic properties of the gastric juice. But this opinion is evidently erroneous. An immense number of facts could be adduced, to show that this is the frequent cause of disease. The British army 'Medical Reports,' and our own Medical Journals, contain many facts of a similar kind. The fever which carried off so many of the United States Dragoons, on a visit to the Pawnees, was occasioned chiefly by drinking stagnant water, filled with animal and vegetable matter. We know that calculus diseases are most frequent in countries that abound in lime water."</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">OTHER LIQUID ALIMENTS, OR DRINKS.</hd><p>The other drinks in most common use are arranged thus,--</p><p>1. <emph rend="italic">The Mucilaginous, Farinaceous, or Saccharine drinks.</emph></p><p>These are water chiefly, with substances slightly nutritive, softening, and soothing. <emph rend="italic">Toast water, Sugar water, Rice water, Barley water,</emph> and the various <emph rend="italic">Gruels,</emph> are of this kind.</p><p>2. <emph rend="italic">The Aromatic and Astringent drinks.</emph></p><p>These include Tea, Coffee, Chicory, Chocolate, and Cocoa.</p><p>The following remarks on these drinks are taken from the work of Dr. Pereira.</p><p>"The peculiar flavor of <emph rend="italic">tea</emph> depends upon the <emph rend="italic">volatile oil,</emph> which has the taste and smell of tea. Alone, it acts as a narcotic, but when combined (as in tea) with tannin, it acts as a diuretic and diaphoretic (i.e. to promote the flow of urine and perspiration). Its astringency, proved by its chemical properties, depends upon the presence of tannin. Of this quality we may beneficially avail ourselves in some cases of poisoning, as by poisonous mushrooms, by opium, or laudanum."</p><p>"The peculiar influence of tea, especially the <emph rend="italic">green</emph> variety, over the nervous system, depends upon the vegetable oil referred to. The influence is analogous to<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=43"/>that of foxglove; for both green tea and foxglove occasion watchfulness, and act as sedatives on the heart and bloodvessels. Strong green tea produces, on some constitutions, usually those popularly known as nervous, very severe effects. It gives rise to tremor, anxiety, sleeplessness, and most distressing feelings."</p><p>"As a diluent and sedative, tea is well adapted to febrile and inflammatory disorders. To its sedative influence should be ascribed the relief of headache sometimes experienced."</p><p>On this subject, Dr. Lee remarks, <emph rend="italic">"Green tea</emph> undoubtedly possesses very active medicinal properties; for a very strong decoction of it, or the extract, speedily destroys life in the inferior animals, even when given in very small doses. The strongly marked effects of tea upon persons of a highly nervous temperament, in causing wakefulness, tremors, palpitations, and other distressing feelings, prove, also, that it is an agent of considerable power. It not unfrequently occasions vertigo, and sick headache, together with a sinking sensation at the pit of the stomach, shortly after eating. It is also opposed to active nutrition, and should, therefore, be used with great moderation by those who are thin in flesh. From its astringent properties it often is useful in a relaxed state of bowels."</p><p>"We are satisfied that <emph rend="italic">green</emph> tea does not, in any case, form a salubrious beverage to people in health, and should give place to milk, milk and water, black tea, milk and sugar, which, when taken tepid, form very agreeable and healthy drinks."</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Coffee.</emph> "The infusion, or decoction of coffee, forms a well known favorite beverage. Like tea, it diminishes the disposition to sleep, and hence it is often resorted to by those who desire nocturnal study. It may also be used to counteract the stupor induced by opium, alcoholic drinks, and other narcotics. In some constitutions it acts as a mild laxative, yet it is usually described as producing constipation. The immoderate use of coffee produces various nervous diseases, such as anxiety,<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=44"/>tremor, disordered vision, palpitation, and feverishness."</p><p><emph rend="italic">Chicory, or Succory.</emph> This is the roasted root of the Wild Endive, or Wild Succory. It is prepared like coffee, and some prefer its flavor to that of coffee.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Chocolate.</emph> This is prepared by roasting the seeds of the Cacoa, or Cocoa, then grinding them and forming them into cakes. "Chocolate, though devoid of the disagreeable qualities of tea and coffee, which disturb the nervous functions, yet is difficult of digestion, on account of the large quantity of oil which it contains, and is, therefore, very apt to disturb the stomach of dyspeptics."</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cocoa.</emph> This is made of the nuts and husks of the cocoa, roasted and ground, and is somewhat less oily than chocolate, and being rather astringent, is adapted to looseness of the bowels. The <emph rend="italic">shells</emph> alone are often used to make a drink, which is less rich than the Cocoa, and especially adapted to weak digestive powers.</p><p>The seeds of the vegetable called Ochra, roasted and prepared like coffee, are said to equal it in flavor.</p><p>3. <emph rend="italic">Acidulous Drinks.</emph></p><p>"The employment of vegetable <emph rend="italic">acid,</emph> as an aliment, is necessary to health. It seems pretty clearly established, that complete and prolonged abstinence from succulent vegetables, or fruits, or their preserved juices, as articles of food, is a cause of scurvy."</p><p>"Water, sharpened with vegetable acids, oftentimes proves a most refreshing beverage, allaying thirst, and moderating excessive heat. Various acids form cooling, refreshing, and antiscorbutic drinks, and are well adapted for hot seasons, and for febrile and inflammatory cases."</p><p>These drinks are prepared by dissolving vegetable acids or acidulous salts in water, sweetening and flavoring it. Also, by decoctions of acid fruits, which promote secretions in the alimentary canal, and act as laxatives.</p><p>The carbonated or effervescing drinks belong to this class. They owe their sparkling briskness to carbonic acid gas confined in the liquid.</p><pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=45"/><p>4. <emph rend="italic">Drinks containing Gelatine and Osmazome.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Gelatine</emph> is that part of animal and vegetable matter that forms jelly.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Osmazome</emph> is that principle in meats which impart their flavor.</p><p>Beef Tea, Mutton, Veal, and Chicken Broths are the principal drinks of this description, and usually are prepared for invalids.</p><p>5. <emph rend="italic">Emulsive, or Milky Drinks.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Animal milk</emph> is the principal drink of this class, and as this is the aliment of a large portion of young children, the necessity of guarding against abuses connected with the supplies furnished should be generally known.</p><p>A great portion of the milk furnished in New York and other large cities, is obtained from cows <emph rend="italic">fed on distillery slops,</emph> and crowded in filthy pens, without regard to ventilation or cleanliness. Thus deprived of pure air and exercise, and fed with unhealthy food, their milk becomes diseased, and is the cause of extensive mortality among young children. Many cows, also, are fed on decayed vegetables, and the sour and putrid offals of kitchens, and these, also, become thus diseased.</p><p>A work on this subject, by R. M. Hartly, Esq., of New York, has been published, which contains these facts. Of five hundred dairies near New York and Brooklyn, all, except five or six, feed their cows on distillery slops. And the reason is, that it yields more milk at a cheaper rate than any other food. But it soon destroys the health of the animals, and after most of their fluids are, by this process, changed to unhealthy milk, and the cows become diseased, they are sent to a cattle market and a new supply obtained.</p><p>The physicians in New York, in a body, have testified to the unhealthiness of this practice, but as yet no inspectors have been secured to preserve the public from this danger, while the great mass of the people are ignorant or negligent on the subject. Chemists have analyzed this unhealthful milk, and find that, while pure milk is alkaline, slop milk is acid, and also contains less than half the nourishment contained in pure milk.<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=46"/>
Scarcely any cream rises on slop milk, and what does collect can never be turned into butter; but, by churning, only changes to froth. We have inspectors of flour, meat, fish, and most other food, and every town and city supplied by milk carts ought to have inspectors of milk; and where this is not done, every mistress of a family should narrowly watch her supplies of milk, and ascertain the mode in which the cows are fed.</p><p>In cases where children, or adults, find that milk troubles the stomach, it is often owing to its <emph rend="italic">richness,</emph> and water should then be mixed with it. Infants generally require diluted milk, a little sweetened, as cow's milk is, when good, considerably richer than mother's milk. The fact that oil is placed among the articles most difficult to digest, shows the mistake of many, who give diluted cream instead of milk, supposing it to be better for infants. In all ordinary cases, where an infant is deprived of the mother's nourishment, the milk of a new milch cow, diluted with one-third, or one-fourth water, and sweetened a little with white sugar, is the safest substitute. Sometimes oat-meal gruel, or arrow-root, are found to agree better with the child's peculiar constitution.</p><p>6. <emph rend="italic">Alcoholic Drinks.</emph></p><p>Beer, Wine, Cider, and Distilled Liquors, are the chief of the alcoholic drinks.</p><p>"To persons in health," says Dr. Pereira, in his "Elements of Materia Medica," "the dietical employment of wine is either useless or pernicious." Dr. Beaumont, in his celebrated experiments on St. Martin,<ref target="n1" height="superscript">*</ref> found that wines, as well as distilled spirits, invariably interfered with the regularity and completeness of digestion, and always produced morbid changes in the mucous membrane of the stomach. And this, too, was the case when neither unpleasant feelings nor diminished appetite indicated such an effect.</p><p id="n1" size="smaller">*This case of St. Martin's referred to, was that of a soldier, who by a gun shot, had an opening made into his stomach, which healed up, leaving so large an orifice, that all the process of digestion could be examined, after he was restored to perfect health.</p><pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=47"/><p>Dr. Bell, of Philadelphia, remarks thus: "The recorded experience of men in all situations and climates, under all kinds of labor and exposure, prove that abstinence from alcoholic drinks gives increased ability to go through the labors of the farm and the workshop, to resist heat and cold, to encounter hardships on sea and land, beyond what has ever been done under the unnatural excitement of alcohol, followed, as it is, by depression and debility, if not by fever and disease. The observation and testimony of naval and military surgeons and commanders are adverse to the issue of alcoholic drinks to men in the army and navy."</p><p>The reports from all our chief state prisons also prove that intemperate men can be instantly deprived of all alcoholic drinks, not only without danger, but with an immediate improvement of the health.</p><p>Wine is often useful as a medicine, under the direction of a physician, but its stimulating, alcoholic principle, makes it an improper agent to be drank in health. The same is true of cider and strong beer. Some wine, beer, and cider drinkers do, by the force of a good constitution, live to a good old age, and so do some persons, also, who live in districts infected by a malaria, which destroys the health and life of thousands. But these <emph rend="italic">exceptions</emph> do not prove that either wine, or malaria are favorable to health, or long life. They are only exceptions to a general rule.</p><p>Meantime, the general rule is established by an incredible amount of experience and testimony, that alcoholic drinks, <emph rend="italic">in no cases,</emph> are needed by those in health, and that the indulgence in drinking them awakens a gnawing thirst and longing for them, that leads the vast majority of those who use them, to disease, debility, poverty, folly, crime, and death.</p><p>In this detail of the various drinks that may be used by man, we find that <emph rend="italic">pure water</emph> is always satisfying, safe, and sufficient. We find that acid and effervescing drinks, so acceptable in hot weather, are also demanded<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=48"/>by the system, and are safe and healthful. We find that milk and broths are also healthful and nourishing.</p><p>Black tea, also, when taken weak and not above blood heat, is a perfectly safe and agreeable warm drink.</p><p>Chocolate and cocoa are nourishing and safe to persons who can bear the oil they contain; and shells are perfectly healthful and safe to all.</p><p>In the vast variety of drinks provided for man, we find very few that are not safe and healthful. Green tea and coffee, as ordinarily used, are very injurious to very many constitutions. They contain but very little nourishment, except what is added by the milk and sugar, and training a family of children to love them (for no child loves them till trained to do it) is making it probable that all of them will be less healthful and comfortable, and certain that some will be great sufferers. Training children to drink tea and coffee is as unreasonable and unchristian, as training them to drink foxglove and opium would be--the only difference is, that in one case it is customary, and the other it is not; and custom makes a practice appear less foolish and sinful.</p><p>There is no need, at this period of the world, to point out the wickedness and folly of training children to love alcoholic drinks.</p><p>In regard to the use of green tea and coffee, one suggestion will be offered. These are drinks which contain very little nourishment, and their effect is to stimulate the nervous system without nourishing it. They are, also, usually drank hot, and heat also is a stimulant to the nerves of the mouth, teeth, throat, and stomach, inducing consequent reacting debility. For it is the unvarying law of the nervous system, that the reacting debility is always in exact proportion to the degree of stimulation.</p>
<p>It is in vain to expect that the great multitudes, who have been accustomed, from childhood, to drink hot tea and coffee, once, twice, and sometimes thrice a day, will give up such a favorite practice. But it is hoped that some may be induced to modify their course, by reducing the <emph rend="italic">strength</emph> and the <emph rend="italic">heat</emph> of their daily potations<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=49"/>It will be found by housekeepers that, if <emph rend="italic">once a month</emph> the daily quantity of tea, or coffee is <emph rend="italic">slightly</emph> reduced, the taste will imperceptibly accommodate; and that, in the course of six or eight months, the habits of a family, by these slight monthly variations, may be changed so as that, eventually, they will love weak tea and coffee as much as they once loved the strong.</p><p>Young housekeepers, who are just beginning to rear a family of children, will perhaps permit one plea for the young beings, whose fate in life so much depends on their physical training. It is the weak and delicate children who are the sufferers, where the habits of a family lead them to love stimulating drinks. The strong and healthy children may escape unharmed, the whole evil falls on those, who are least able to bear it. Oh mother, save the weak lambs of your fold! Save them from those untold agonies that result from rasped and debilitated nerves, worn out by unhealthful stimulus! And set before your household the Divine injunction--"We, then, that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."</p><p>In regard to the selection of food, a housekeeper can have small excuse for ever risking the health of her family by providing unhealthy food, or cooking it in an unhealthful manner. Innumerable dishes, and enough to furnish a new variety for every day of the year, can be made of food that is safe and healthful, and cooked in a healthful manner.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Avoid condiments, fats, and food cooked in fats, and always provide light and sweet yeast bread,</emph> is the rule which shuts out almost everything that is pernicious to health, and leaves an immense variety from which to select what is both healthful and grateful to the palate.</p><p>There are some directions in regard to times and manner of taking food, that are given more at large, with the reasons for them, in the "Domestic Economy," but which will briefly be referred to, because so important.</p><p>Eating <emph rend="italic">too fast</emph> is unhealthful, because the food is not properly masticated, or mixed with the saliva, nor has<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=50"/>the stomach sufficient time to perform its office on the last portion swallowed before another enters.</p><p>Eating <emph rend="italic">too often</emph> is unhealthful, because it is weakening and injurious to mix fresh food with that which is partly digested, and because the stomach needs rest after the labor of digesting a meal. In grown persons four or five hours should intervene between each meal. Children, who are growing fast, need a luncheon of simple bread between meals.</p><p>Eating <emph rend="italic">too much</emph> is unhealthful, because the stomach can properly digest only that amount which is needed to nourish the system. The rest is thrown off undigested, or crowded into parts of the system where it is injurious.</p><p>Eating food when <emph rend="italic">too hot</emph> is injurious, as weakening the nerves of the teeth and stomach by the stimulus of heat.</p><p>Eating <emph rend="italic">highly seasoned</emph> food is unhealthful, because it stimulates too much, provokes the appetite too much, and often is indigestible.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Badly cooked</emph> food is unhealthful, because it is indigestible, and in other ways injurious.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Excessive fatigue</emph> weakens the power of digestion, and in such cases, a meal should be delayed till a little rest is gained.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Bathing</emph> should never follow a meal, as it withdraws the blood and nervous vigor demanded for digestion, from the stomach to the skin.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Violent exercise</emph> should not follow a full meal, as that also withdraws the blood and nervous energies from the stomach to the muscles.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Water,</emph> and other drinks, should never be taken in large quantities, either with, or immediately after a meal, as they dilute the gastric juice, and tend to prevent perfect digestion. But it is proper to drink a moderate quantity of liquid while eating.</p><p>Where there is a strong constitution and much exercise in the open air, children and adults may sometimes violate these and all other laws of health, and yet remain strong and well.</p><p>But all, and especially those, who have delicate constitutions,<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=51"/>and are deprived of fresh air and exercise, will have health and strength increased and prolonged by attending to these rules.</p></section></chapter>

<section class1="marketing"><hd align="center">MARKETING.</hd><p>In selecting <emph rend="italic">Fish,</emph> take those that are firm and thick, having stiff fins and bright scales, the gills bright red, and the eyes full and prominent. When Fish are long out of water they grow soft, the fins bend easily, the scales are dim, the gills grow dark, and the eyes sink and shrink away. Be sure and have them dressed immediately, sprinkle them with salt, and use them, if possible, the same day. In warm weather put them in ice, or corning, for the next day. Shell Fish can be decided upon only by the smell. Lobsters are not good unless alive, or else boiled before offered for sale. They are black when alive, and red when boiled. When to be boiled, they are to be put alive into boiling water, which is the quickest and least cruel way to end life.</p><p>In selecting <emph rend="italic">Beef,</emph> take that which has a coarse, loose grain, which easily yields to the pressure of finger, or knife; which is a purplish red, and has whitish fat. Ox Beef is best. If the lean is purplish and the fat very yellow, it is bad Beef. If it is coarse-grained and hard to break or cut, it is tough. Stall-fed has lighter fat than grass-fed Beef.</p><p>If meat is frozen, lay it in cold water to thaw. A piece of ten pounds, or more, will require all night to thaw.

If you buy the head, see that the eyes are plump and lively, and not dull and sunk in the head. If you buy the legs, get those which are not skinned, as the skin is good for jelly, or soup.</p><p>In choosing <emph rend="italic">Mutton,</emph> take that which is bright red and close grain, with firm and white fat. The meat should feel tender and springy on pressure. Notice the vein in the neck of the fore quarter, which should be a fine blue.</p><p>In selecting <emph rend="italic">Pork,</emph> if young, the lean can easily be broken when pinched, and the skin can be indented by nipping with the fingers.

Good Bacon has white fat and the lean adheres closely to the bone. If the Bacon has yellow streaks, it is rusty, and not fit to use.</p><p>In selecting <emph rend="italic">Poultry,</emph> choose those that are full grown, but not old. When young and fresh killed, the skin is thin and tender, the joints not very stiff, and the eyes full and bright. The breast bone shows the age, as it easily yields to pressure if young, and is tough when old. If young, you can with a pin easily tear the skin. A goose, when old, has red and hairy legs, but when young, they are yellow and have few hairs. The pinfeathers are the roots of feathers, which break off and remain in the skin, and always indicate a <emph rend="italic">young</emph> bird.

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Wheat Bread of Potato Yeast.</purpose>
This is made like bread made with home-brewed yeast, except that you may put in almost any quantity of the <ingredient>potato yeast</ingredient> without injury. Those who use potato yeast like it much better than any other. The only objection to it is, that in summer it must be made often, as it will not keep sweet long. But it is very easily renewed. The chief advantage is, that it rises quick, and never gives the sharp and peculiar taste so often imparted to bread and cake by all yeast made with hops.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Directions for freezing Ice Cream.</purpose>
If you have no apparatus for the purpose (which is <emph rend="italic">almost</emph> indispensable), put the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> into a tin pail with a very tight cover, mix equal quantities of <ingredient>snow</ingredient> and <ingredient>blown salt</ingredient> (not the coarse salt), or of <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> in a tub, and put it <emph rend="italic">as high as the pail, or freezer;</emph> turn the pail or freezer half round and back again with one hand, for half an hour, or longer, if you want it very nice. Three quarters of an hour steadily, will make it good enough. While doing this, stop four or five times, and mix the frozen part with the rest, the last time very thoroughly, and then the <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> must be put in. Then cover the freezer tight with snow and salt till it is wanted. The mixture must be perfectly cool before being put in the freezer. Renew the snow and salt while shaking, so as to have it kept tight to the sides of the freezer. A hole in the tub holding the freezing mixture to let off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> is a great advantage. In a tin pail it would take much longer to freeze than in the freezer, probably nearly twice as long, or one hour and a half. A long stick, like a <implement>coffee stick,</implement> should be used in scraping the ice from the sides. Iron spoons will be affected by the lemon juice, and give a bad taste.</p><p>In taking it out for use, first wipe off every particle of the freezing mixture dry, then with a knife loosen the sides, then invert the freezer upon the dish in which the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> is to be served, and apply two towels rung out of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to the bottom part, and the whole will slide out in the shape of a cylinder.</p><p>If you wish to put it into moulds, pour it into them when the cream is frozen sufficiently, and then cover the moulds in the snow and salt till they are wanted. Dip the moulds in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> to make the ice slip out easily.</p><p>If you wish to have a freezer made, send the following directions to a tinner.</p><p>Make a tin cylinder box, eighteen inches high and eight inches in diameter at the bottom, and a trifle larger at the top, so that the frozen cream will slip out easier<pb n="167" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=192"/>Have a cover made with a rim to lap over three inches, and fitted tight. Let there be a round handle fastened to the lid, an inch in diameter, and reaching nearly across, to take hold of, to stir the cream. This will cost from fifty to seventy-five cents.</p><p>The tub holding the ice and freezer should have a hole in the bottom, to let the water run off, and through the whole process the ice must be close packed the whole depth of the freezer.</p></recipe>

One class consider it to be a sin <emph rend="italic">in itself,</emph> to take anything that contains the intoxicating principle.</p><p>Another class adopt the temperance pledge on the principle urged by St. Paul in 1 Cor. 8:13, and engage not to use intoxicating drinks <emph rend="italic">as a beverage,</emph> nor to offer them to others, and maintain that though neither their pledge nor divine command requires more than this, yet that, to <emph rend="italic">avoid the appearance of evil,</emph> they will not use any kind of alcoholic liquors for <emph rend="italic">any</emph> purpose. Such will not employ it in <emph rend="italic">cooking,</emph> nor keep it in their houses.</p><p>The third class believe that the wisest course is to adopt the pledge "not to use, or offer to others intoxicating drinks <emph rend="italic">as a beverage, "</emph> and strictly to adhere, both to the spirit and letter of this pledge, but not to go beyond it. Such think it proper to use wine and brandy in cooking, and occasionally for medicinal purposes, and suppose that the cause of temperance will be best promoted by going no farther. The writer belongs to this last class, and therefore has not deemed it desirable to omit or alter receipts in which wine and brandy are employed for cooking</p><p>It has now become almost universal, in the medical profession, to maintain the principle, that alcoholic drinks, except as medicine, are <emph rend="italic">never</emph> needful, but as the general rule, are always injurious. And they consider that those cases where the use of them seems to involve no evil, should be regarded as owing to the fact that a strong constitution, or some peculiarity of temperament, can occasionally resist the evil influence for a certain length of <pb n="184" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=209"/>time, just as some persons, by similar causes, are sustained in health in a malaria district.</p><p>But none can tell how long a good constitution will resist the baleful operation of alcohol or malaria, nor are these exceptions any argument in favor either of intoxicating drinks or a pestilential atmosphere.</p><p>The great abundance of delicious and healthful drinks that are within reach, leaves no excuse for resorting to such as are pernicious. The following receipts furnish a great variety, and many of them are very easily and cheaply obtained.</p><p>In regard to effervescing drinks, Dr.Pereira remarks:</p><p>"Water charged with carbonic acid forms a cool and refreshing beverage. It acts as a diaphoretic and diuretic (i.e., to promote perspiration and the healthful action of the kidneys), and is a most valuable agent for checking nausea and vomiting. When it contains bicarbonate of soda in solution, it proves antacid, and is a most valuable beverage for persons afflicted with calculi in the bladder."</p><p>The following receipts may be tried in succession, and some among them will suit the taste of every one.

<hd align="center" rend="italic">Remarks on the Combinations of Cooking.</hd><p>The preceding receipts have been tested by the best housekeepers. In reviewing them, it will be seen that there are several ways of combining the various articles, all of which have, in the hands of good housekeepers, proved successful. Still it will be found that some methods are more successful than others.</p><p>In most cases, the receipts have been written as given by the ladies, who endorse them as <emph rend="italic">the best.</emph> But it is believed that the following general rules will enable a housekeeper to modify some of them to advantage.</p><pb n="202" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=227"/><p>In using <emph rend="italic">the whites of eggs,</emph> it is found, as shown by several receipts, that various combinations are much lighter when they are cut to a froth, and put in <emph rend="italic">the last thing.</emph> This is so in batter puddings, and several other receipts. It seems, therefore, probable that in all cases, cake and pies, and puddings that will allow it, will be lighter by adding the cut whites of the eggs <emph rend="italic">the last minute before cooking.</emph> Sponge cake especially would most probably be most easily made light by this method.</p><p>In using alkalies with acids to raise mixtures, the poorest is pearlash, the next best is saleratus; bicarbonate of soda is still better, and sal volatile is best of all.</p><p>But one thing must be remembered in reference to sal volatile, and that is, that the lightness made by it is owing to the disengagement of the gas by <emph rend="italic">heat.</emph> It is mixed with the flour, and when set in the oven, the heat volatilizes and expels the gas, and thus the lightness is induced. Of course <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> water must not be used to dissolve it, as it would expel much of the gas. Sal volatile must be kept powdered, and closely confined in glass bottles with ground glass stoppers. It is certain to make any mixture light that can be raised by anything.</p><p>Cream tartar is best bought in lumps, and then pulverized and kept corked.</p><p>When saleratus is used with sour milk or buttermilk, the flour should be wet up with the sour milk, and then the alkali dissolved, and worked in. This makes the effervescence take place <emph rend="italic">in the mixture;</emph> whereas, if the alkali is put into the sour liquid, much of the carbonic acid generated is lost before it reaches the flour.</p><p>In all cases, then, where saleratus is used with acid wetting, it would seem best to wet up the flour with at least a part of the sour liquid, before putting in the alkali.</p><p>When the alkali is a light powder, it may sometimes be mixed thoroughly with the flour, and then the sour liquid be mixed in. The experiment can be made by any who like to learn the result. A lady who understands chemistry may often improve her receipts by applying chemical principles. All the lightness made by<pb n="203" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=228"/>an acid and an alkali is owing to the disengagement of carbonic acid, which is retained by the gluten of the flour. Of course, then, that mode is best which secures most effectually all the carbonic acid generated by the combination.</p><p>Cooking is often much improved by a judicious use of <emph rend="italic">sugar</emph> or <emph rend="italic">molasses.</emph> Thus, in soups, a very little sugar, say half a teaspoonful to the quart, gives <emph rend="italic">body</emph> to the soup, and just about as much sweetness as is found in the juices of the best and sweetest kinds of meat. It is very good when the meats used are of inferior kind, and destitute of sweetness. So in preparing vegetables that are destitute of sweetness, a little sugar is a great improvement. Mashed turnips, squash, and pumpkin, are all of them much improved by extracting all the water, and adding a little sugar, especially so when they are poor.</p><p>A little molasses always improves all bread or cakes made of unbolted wheat or rye.</p><p>A little lard or butter always improves cakes made of Indian meal, as it makes them light and tender.</p><p>The careful use of <emph rend="italic">salt</emph> is very important in cooking. Everything is better to have the salt cooked in it, but there should always be a <emph rend="italic">little less</emph> salt than most would like, as it is easy for those who wish more to add it, but none can subtract it.</p><p>When the shortening is butter, no salt is needed in cakes and puddings, but in all combinations that have no salt in shortening, it must be added. A little salt in sponge cake, custards, and the articles used for desserts, made of gelatine, rice, sago, and tapioca, is a great improvement, giving both <emph rend="italic">body</emph> and flavor.</p></chapter>

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Directions for making Butter.</purpose>
Two particulars are indispensable to success in making <emph rend="italic">good</emph> <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> the first is, that the churning be frequent, so that the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will not grow bitter, or sour; and the second is <emph rend="italic">cleanliness</emph> in all the implements an processes connected with it.</p><p><variation>In hot weather it is important to keep the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> cream, and butter as cool as possible. For this purpose, those who have no ice-house, or very cool milk-room, hang their cream down a well. In winter it is needful to raise the temperature of the cream a little, while churning, but care must be taken to do it very slightly, or the butter is injured. The best way is to warm the <implement>churn,</implement> and churn in a warm room.</variation></p><p><variation>After the weather gets cold, the cream rises more perfectly after allowing the milk to stand say ten or eleven hours, to set it over a furnace a while till it is warmed through, but not heated hot enough to boil. Then take it back, let it stand eleven hours longer, and skim it. This secures more, and better cream.</variation></p><p><variation>In hot weather, set the <implement>churn</implement> into a tub of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and churn steadily, as stopping puts back the process, and injures the butter. In hot weather, do not churn very fast, as it makes soft butter.</variation> When the butter has come, collect it in a wooden bowl, which is the best article to work it in, having first scalded it, and then put it in cold water till cold. <emph rend="italic">Do not use the hand</emph> in working over butter, as it injures it so much that a higher<pb n="207" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=232"/>price is often paid for butter made without using the hand.</p><p>A wooden spad made for the purpose is the proper article for working over butter.</p><p>As soon as the butter is put in the bowl, pour in as much of the <ingredient>coldest water</ingredient> as will allow you to work the butter, and keep adding and pouring off cold water, as you work it, until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will run off clear. It is continuing this process until <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is extracted, which alone will secure butter that will keep good and sweet. Water hastens the process, but butter keeps longer not to have it used.</p><p>No precise direction can be given for salting, as tastes vary so much in regard to this. It is a good way to notice the proportions which are most agreeable, and note the measure, and then measure ever after.</p><p>In salting down in <implement>firkins,</implement> use the nicest <ingredient>rock salt,</ingredient> as much depends on the nature of the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> The <implement>firkins</implement> must be very thoroughly seasoned, and the bottom covered with salt, and the sides rubbed with it. Pack the butter in layers, with salt between. After a few days, the butter will shrink from the sides, and then the space must be filled with new and nice brine. Muslin spread under and over the layer of salt, between the layers of butter is a good plan, as it saves the butter.</p><p>It is said that butter will be preserved sweet a long time for journeys, or voyages, by working into it very thoroughly a mixture composed of one-fourth salt, one-fourth <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and two-fourths <ingredient>white sugar.</ingredient></p><p>In large dairies, the milk is churned soon after it is taken from the cow.</p><p>The quality of butter depends very much upon the kind of cows. Those who give a great deal of milk, are usually small and thin. Every cow should have a tea-cup full of salt each week, and must be well fed. Green cornstalks and carrots, are excellent for cows. Turnips, cabbage, and parsnips spoil the milk. The waste of the kitchen, with a quart of corn meal, and as much hay as she will eat daily, is good fare. Skimmed milk for drink is good, and if it is refused, withhold water, and<pb n="208" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=233"/>the cow will learn to love it. Milk three times a day, and you get much more cream; stripping must be done thoroughly, or you lose cream, and dry up the cow. Never make a cow run, as it injures the milk. Use tin vessels for milk.</p><p>A <implement>stoneware churn</implement> is best, and a tin one is better than wood. Keep milk in a cool place, where air circulates freely; close air spoils milk and cream. Never stir milk after it is set, as it stops the rising of the cream. Skim milk as soon as it becomes <emph rend="italic">loppard.</emph> Put a little <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in each pan in hot weather, and you get more cream. In skimming milk, do not scrape off the hardest portion that adheres to the pan, as it injures the butter. Put a spoonful of salt to each pailful of milk (except what is for family use), and it makes the butter sweeter, and come easier. Salt your cream as you gather it, and it keeps better, and makes sweeter butter. In hot weather churn in the coolest part of the day, and in a cool place, and do not shut the air out of the <implement>churn,</implement> as it is necessary to make the butter come. Butter is best, to work it enough the first time. Never work it three times. It will keep better to work out the buttermilk without putting in water. The more entirely it is freed from buttermilk, the longer it will keep sweet.</p><p><variation><purpose>A good brine is made for butter</purpose> by dissolving a quart of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> a pound of <ingredient>loaf sugar,</ingredient> and a teaspoonful of saltpetre in two quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and then strain it on to the butter.</variation> Packed butter is most perfectly preserved sweet by setting the <implement>firkin</implement> into a larger <implement>firkin,</implement> and filling in with good brine, and covering it. Butter will keep sweet a year thus.</p><p>Buttermilk kept in potter's ware dissolves the glazing, and becomes poisonous.</p><p>Never scald strainers or milky vessels till thoroughly washed, as the milk or cream put in them will be injured by it. The best way to scald such vessels is to plunge them all over into <ingredient>scalding water,</ingredient> and then every spot is scalded.</p><p>Butter will sometimes not come because the air is too much excluded from the <implement>churn.</implement></p></recipe></chapter>

They are sometimes useful, also, in lessening the irritating contents of the alimentary canal."</p><p>"But in some maladies it is necessary to restrict the quantity of fluids taken, or, in other words, to employ a <emph rend="italic">dry diet."</emph></p><p>As it is so customary for invalids to throng to watering places, the following remarks contain very important cautions.</p><p>"The Congress Water at Saratoga," says Dr.Lee, "though it possesses active medical qualities, yet, except in diseases attended with inflammatory action, seldom occasions unpleasant consequences, unless drank in very large quantities, when it often causes serious, if not dangerous effects." Dr. Steel, a physician who has devoted much attention to this subject, remarks, "About <emph rend="italic">three pints</emph> should be taken, an hour or two before breakfast, and be followed by exercise, to produce a cathartic effect. Where more is needed for this effect, add a teaspoonful or two of Epsom salts to the first <implement>tumbler.</implement> It should not be drank at all during the remainder of the day by those who wish to experience the full benefit of its use. It would be better for those whose complaints render them fit subjects for its administration, if the fountain should be locked up, and no one suffered to approach it after the hour of nine or ten in the morning."</p><p>It is probable that multitudes who frequent mineral<pb n="210" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=235"/>springs, not only lose all benefit, but suffer injury by the excessive use of the water. Such waters should, by invalids, be taken under the direction of a physician well acquainted with their nature and uses.</p><p>Alcoholic drinks should never be given to the sick, except by direction of a physician, as they are powerful medical agents, and in some cases would increase disease.</p><p>The acid drinks are ordinarily those most relished by the sick, and they are, usually, very serviceable, especially in febrile and other inflammatory attacks. Ice cream and drinks are good for the sick, especially in fevers.</p><p>When a person is debilitated by sickness, the stomach should never be loaded with rich food. Nor should the palate be tempted by favorite articles, when no appetite for food exists, as this is the indication of nature that the stomach is in no order to digest food.</p><p>Dr. Lee remarks, "We regard rice as the most valuable of all the articles of food, in cases of the derangement of the digestive organs. It nourishes, while it soothes the irritable mucous membrane, and while it supports strength, never seems to aggravate the existing disease. For acute, or chronic affections of the alimentary canal, rice water for drink, and rice jelly for food, seem peculiarly well adapted, and appear to exert a specific influence in bringing about a recovery. These preparations are invaluable also in convalescence from acute fevers and other maladies, and in the summer complaints of young children."</p><p>"Isinglass is a very pure form of gelatine, and dissolved in milk, sweetened and flavored, is taken with advantage by convalescents when recovering from debility."</p><p>Cod sounds, and the American gelatine, are equally good. Calve's foot jelly, blanc mange, and other gelatinous food, are among the best kinds of nourishment, especially in cases of cholera infantum. The slight quantity of spice or wine used to flavor such articles, except in peculiar cases, cannot do any injury.</p><pb n="211" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=236"/><p>Buttered toast, either dry or dipped, rarely is a suitable article for the sick, as melted oils are very difficult of digestion. Where there are strong powers of digestion, it may be proper.</p><p>Many cases of illness, among both adults and children, are readily cured by <emph rend="italic">abstinence from all food.</emph> Headaches, disordered stomachs, and many other attacks, are caused, often, by violating the rules of health laid down in the preceding chapter, and in consequence, some part of the system is overloaded, or some of the organs are clogged. Omitting one, two, or three meals, as the case may be, gives the system a chance to rest, and thus to gain strength, and allows the clogged organs to dispose of their burdens. The practice of giving drugs to "clear out the stomach," though it may afford the needed relief, always weakens the system, while <emph rend="italic">abstinence</emph> secures the good result, and yet does no injury.</p><p>Said a young gentleman to a distinguished medical practitioner of Philadelphia,--"Doctor, what do you do for yourself, when you have a turn of headache, or other slight attack?" "Go without my dinner," was the reply. "Well, if that will not do, what do you do then?" "Go without my supper," was the answer. "But if that does not cure you, what then?" "Go without my breakfast. We physicians seldom take medicines ourselves, or use them in our families, for <emph rend="italic">we</emph> know that <emph rend="italic">starving</emph> is better, but we cannot make our patients believe it."</p>
<p>Many cases of slight indisposition are cured by a <emph rend="italic">change of diet.</emph> Thus, if a person suffers from constipation, and, as the consequence, has headaches, slight attacks of fever, or dyspepsia, the cause often may be removed by eating rye mush and molasses for breakfast, brown bread, baked apples, and other fruits.</p><p>In cases of diarrh&#x153;a, rice water for drink, and rice pudding or jelly, will often remove the evil.</p><p>In cases of long-continued confinement from sickness, it is very desirable to have a good variety of articles for the sick, as the invalid is wearied with the same round,<pb n="212" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=237"/>and perhaps may be suffering for some ingredient of food, which is not found in the articles provided.</p><p>For this reason, a large number of receipts of articles for the sick have been provided in this work. In preparing them, great care should be used to have every article employed clean and pure, and to prevent any burning in cooking, as the sensibilities of the sick to bad tastes and smells are very acute.</p><p>It is often the case in dyspepsia and cholera infantum, that jellies of American gelatine are very much better than any preparations of farinaceous food, being much more easily digested.</p><p>It would be a happy thing for the sick, and a most benevolent custom, if the young ladies of a place should practise cooking the various articles for the sick, and carrying them to invalids as an offering of kindness and sympathy. It would be twice a blessing, first to the invalid, and quite as much to the young benefactress.</p><p>There are many little comforts and alleviations for the sick, which should be carefully attended to, which are particularly pointed out in the chapter on the Care of the Sick, in the Domestic Economy. Such, for example, as keeping a room neat, clean, and in perfect order, having every article in use sweet and clean, keeping a good supply of cool water, providing pleasant perfumes, lemons, flowers, and other objects agreeable to the senses, speaking softly, kindly, and cheerfully, and reading the Bible and other cheering books of the kind, whenever it will be acceptable. Be careful to change the linen next the skin, and the bed linen, often. Be sure to ventilate the room thoroughly, two or three times a day, as pure air is a great restorative of health and strength. Wash the skin often, as it has a great tendency to restore health, and never, except in very peculiar cases, can do any harm.</p><p>Always request a physician to <emph rend="italic">write</emph> all his directions, that no mistake may be made, and nothing be forgotten. Always inquire of him as to the exact mode of preparing every article ordered, and never venture to alter, or omit, what he directs, unless you are sure that you<pb n="213" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=238"/>are better qualified to practise than he, in which case he should be dismissed, and you should assume his duties.</p><p>Always keep all medicines in papers and vials, <emph rend="italic">labelled,</emph> that poisons be not given by mistake, or other injurious articles used.</p><p>The drawing at Fig.5 represents a contrivance for the sick, which ought to be prepared in every village, to rent out to those who need it.</p><illustration><caption>Fig.5</caption><description>An illustration of a person in a "water bed" or "hydrostatic couch" with lettered areas referred to in the text.</description></illustration><p>It is called the <emph rend="italic">Water Bed,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Hydrostatic Couch,</emph> and is made at an expense of from twelve to fifteen dollars. The object of it is to relieve the sufferings of those who, from extreme emaciation, or from ulcers, or bed sores, are great sufferers from the pressure of the bed on these sore places. This kind of bed proves a great relief from this kind of suffering.</p><p>It consists of a wooden box, six feet long, and two feet and a half wide at the top, and the sides gradually sloping inward, making it fourteen inches deep. This is lined with sheet zinc, to make it water tight. Over this is thrown, and fastened to the edge of the box, a sheet of thick India rubber, water-proof cloth, large enough for <emph rend="italic">an entire lining</emph> to the inside of the box. The edges of it are first made to adhere to the upper edge of the box with spirit varnish, and then a thin strip of board is nailed on, to fasten it firmly, and make it water tight. Near the bottom, at A, is a hole and plug, to let off water; and at B, a tin tube, soldered in the upper part of the outside, to pour water in. When used, the box is to be filled half full of water, about blood warmth. Then a woollen blanket and pillow are laid upon the India<pb n="214" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=239"/><implement>rubber cloth,</implement> and the patient laid on them, and he will float as he would in water, and there will be no pressure on any part of the body greater than is felt when the body is in water.</p><p>This is important for all who suffer from bed sores, or sloughing in protracted fevers, from diseases in the hip-joint, from diseases of the spine, lingering consumption, and all diseases that compel to a protracted recumbent position. None but those who have seen, or experienced the relief and comfort secured to sufferers by this bed, can conceive of its value. The writer saw the case of a young man, who was enduring indescribable tortures with the most dreadful ulcers all over his body, and who had for several days and nights been unable to sleep, from extreme suffering. This bed was made for him, as an experiment, after trying every other mode of relief in vain. It was placed by his bedside, and the water poured in, and then his friends raised him with the greatest care in a blanket, and laid him on it. Instantly his groans ceased, an expression of relief and delight stole over his countenance, and exhausted nature sunk instantly into the most peaceful and protracted slumbers. And ever after, he was relieved from his former sufferings. Every hospital, every alms-house, and every village should have the means of obtaining such a bed for the many classes of sufferers who would thus find relief, and it is <emph rend="italic">woman</emph> who should interest herself to secure such a comfort for the sick, who especially are commended to her benevolent ministries.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a "sick couch" with lettered areas referred to in the text.</description></illustration><p>The drawing, AA, is the outline of a <emph rend="italic">sick couch,</emph> such as would prove a great comfort in every family, and at<pb n="215" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=240"/>a small expense. The following are the dimensions:--Length of seat inside, six feet three inches; breadth, twenty-eight inches; height of the seat from the floor, thirteen inches. The swing frame, <emph rend="italic">dd,</emph> is three feet long, and is fastened three feet from the head-board by a very large pin or screw. The seat should be of sacking, and a thick hair mattrass, or cushion for a bed or cushion and be divided into two parts, where the swing frame is fastened. The frame is fastened by large screws at<emph rend="italic">ff.</emph> The supporter, <emph rend="italic">ee,</emph> is fastened by large and strong hinges to the upper part of the frame, and is moved into the notches made in the frame of the seat. When in the notch <emph rend="italic">a,</emph> the frame is very low; when in notch <emph rend="italic">b,</emph> it is higher; and when at <emph rend="italic">c,</emph> it is as high as is needful to raise the sick. A piece of sacking is to be fastened over the frame, leaving it loose, especially at the top, and leaving a space at <emph rend="italic">o,</emph> so as to give room for a pillow, and so that the head can be thrown a little back. The frame and supporter must be thick and strong. When not in use for the sick, the frame can be laid down, and the cushion laid over it, and then with a frill fastened in front, it makes a good-looking and most comfortable chamber couch, or a lolling sofa for a sitting-room.</p><p>Such a couch saves much labor to friends and nurses, because it is so low, so easily moved, and the nurse can go around it and work on both sides so easily, while the frame raises the patient with great ease and comfort. It would be a good plan to engage some carpenter or cabinet-maker, in every village, to provide such an article to to rent out, and probably it would be in constant demand.</p><p>The frame, supporter, hinges, and screws, must be <emph rend="italic">very</emph> strong, or they will break.</p><p>Fig. 6 represents a contrivance for securing exercise in the open air for invalids, which would often prove convenient and agreeable.</p><p>Such an article can be easily made of the broken toy of a child, called a velocipede, or the back wheels of a child's wagon. Nothing but shafts are needed, and a common rocking-chair, with a foot-board nailed across<pb n="216" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=241"/>the front rocker, on which to rest the feet. The chair is then slipped along back to the axle of the wheels, so that the shafts, when raised, are under the seat, and lift it up. In this way an invalid can be rolled through yards and gardens with very little effort, and with great comfort and relief to the imprisoned sufferer, who perhaps can ride in no other way.</p><illustration><caption>Fig. 6.</caption><description>An illustration an apparatus that may be used to convert a rocking chair into a pseudo wheel chair.</description></illustration><p>There is no way of relieving the weariness and nervousness of an invalid more effectually than by rubbing the limbs and arms with the bare hand of a healthful person.</p><p>Those who believe in animal magnetism would say, that by this method, the well person imparts a portion of the magnetism of a healthful body to aid in restoring the sick. Those who do not believe in it, will say that it <emph rend="italic">soothes and strengthens the nerves.</emph> Either way, it is a great comfort to a suffering invalid.</p><p>It is unhealthful to sleep with a sick person, especially one who has lung complaints, as the breath and effluvia 
from the skin sometimes communicate disease, even in complaints not contagious. Young children should not sleep with the aged, because their healthful fluids will be absorbed.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="generalfood"><pb n="217" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=242"/><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXIII.</hd><hd align="center">THE PROVIDING AND CARE OF FAMILY STORES.</hd><p>THE art of keeping a good table, consists, not in loading on a variety at each meal, but rather in securing a <emph rend="italic">successive</emph> variety, a table neatly and tastefully set, and everything that is on it, cooked in the best manner.</p><p>There are some families who provide an abundance of the most expensive and choice articles, and spare no expenses in any respect, who yet have everything cooked in such a miserable way, and a table set in so slovenly a manner, that a person accustomed to a <emph rend="italic">really</emph> good table, can scarcely taste a morsel with any enjoyment.</p><p>On the contrary, there are many tables where the closest economy is practised, and yet the table-cloth is so white and smooth, the dishes, silver, glass, and other table articles so bright, and arranged with such propriety, the bread so white, light, and sweet, the butter so beautiful, and every other article of food so well cooked, and so neatly and tastefully served, that everything seems good, and pleases both the eye and the palate.</p><p>A habit of <emph rend="italic">doing everything in the best manner,</emph> is of unspeakable importance to a housekeeper, and every woman ought to <emph rend="italic">aim</emph> at it, however great the difficulties she may have to meet. If a young housekeeper commences with a determination to <emph rend="italic">try</emph> to do <emph rend="italic">everything</emph> in the best manner, and perseveres in the effort, meeting all obstacles with patient cheerfulness, not only the moral, but the intellectual tone of her mind is elevated by the attempt. Although she may meet many insuperable difficulties, and may never reach the standard at which she aims, the simple effort, <emph rend="italic">persevered</emph> in, will have an elevating influence on her character, while at the same time she actually will reach a point of excellence<pb n="218" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=243"/>far ahead of those who, discouraged by many obstacles, give up in despair, and resolve to make no more efforts, and let things go as they will. The grand distinction between a noble and an ignoble mind is, that one <emph rend="italic">will</emph> control circumstances; the other yields, and allows circumstances to control her.</p><p>It should be borne in mind, that the constitution of man demands <emph rend="italic">a variety</emph> of food, and that it is just as cheap to keep on hand a good variety of materials in the store-closet, so as to make a frequent change, as it is to buy one or two articles at once, and live on them exclusively, till every person is tired of them, and then buy two or three more of another kind.</p><p>It is too frequently the case, that families fall into a very limited round of articles, and continue the same course from one year to another, when there is a much greater variety within reach, of articles which are just as cheap and easily obtained, and yet remain unthought of and untouched.</p><p>A thrifty and generous provider, will see that her store-closet is furnished with such a variety of articles, that successive changes can be made, and for a good length of time. To aid in this, a slight sketch of a well-provided store-closet will be given, with a description of the manner in which each article should be stored and kept, in order to avoid waste and injury. To this will be added, modes of securing a <emph rend="italic">successive variety,</emph> within the reach of all in moderate circumstances.</p><p>It is best to have a store-closet open from a kitchen, because the kitchen fire keeps the atmosphere dry, and this prevents the articles stored from moulding, and other injury from dampness. Yet it must not be kept warm, as there are many articles which are injured by warmth.</p><p>A <emph rend="italic">cool</emph> and <emph rend="italic">dry</emph> place is indispensable for a store-room, and a small window over the door, and another opening out-doors, is a great advantage, by securing coolness, and a circulation of fresh air.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Flour</emph> should be kept in a barrel, with a <implement>flour scoop</implement> to dip it, a sieve to sift it, and a pan to hold the sifted flour, either in the barrel, or close at hand. The barrel<pb n="219" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=244"/>should have a tight cover to keep out mice and vermin. It is best, when it can be conveniently done, to find, by trial, a lot of first-rate flour, and then buy a year's supply. But this should not be done, unless there are accommodations for keeping it dry and cool, and protecting it from vermin.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Unbolted flour</emph> should be stored in barrels, and always be kept on hand, as regularly as fine flour.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Indian meal</emph> should be purchased in small quantities, say fifteen or twenty pounds at a time, and be kept in a covered tub or keg. When new and sweet, it should not be scalded, but when not perfectly fresh and good when used, it is improved by scalding. It must be kept very cool and dry, and if occasionally stirred, is preserved more surely from growing sour or musty.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Rye</emph> should be bought in small quantities, say forty or fifty pounds at a time, and be kept in a keg, or half barrel with a cover.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Buckwheat, Rice, Hominy,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Ground Rice,</emph> must be purchased in small quantities, and kept in covered kegs, or tubs. Several of these articles are infested with small black insects, and examination must occasionally be made for them.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Arrowroot, Tapioca, Sago, Pearl Barley, American Isinglass, Macaroni, Vermacelli,</emph> and <emph rend="bold">Oatmeal,</emph> are all articles which help to make an agreeable variety, and it is just as cheap to buy a small quantity of each, as it is to buy a larger quantity of two or three articles. Eight or ten pounds of each of these articles of food can be stored in covered jars, or covered wood boxes, and then they are always at hand to help make a variety. All of them are very healthful food, and help to form many delightful dishes for desserts. Some of the most healthful puddings are those made of rice, tapioca, sago, and macaroni, while isinglass, or American gelatine, form elegant articles for desserts, and is also excellent for the sick.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sugars</emph> should not be bought by the barrel, as the brown is apt to turn to molasses, and run out on to the floor. It is best to keep four qualities of sugar on hand.</p><pb n="220" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=245"/><p>Refined loaf for tea, crushed sugar for the nicest preserves and to use with fruit, nice brown sugar for coffee, and common brown for cooking and more common use. The loaf can be stored in the papers, on a shelf. The others should be kept in close covered kegs, or covered wooden articles made for the purpose.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Butter</emph> must be kept in the dryest and coldest place you can find, in vessels of either stone, earthen, or wood, and never in tin.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Lard and Drippings</emph> must be kept in a dry, cold place, and should not be salted. Usually the cellar is the best place for them. Earthen, or stone jars are the best to store them in.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Salt</emph> must be kept in the <emph rend="italic">dryest</emph> place that can be found. <emph rend="italic">Rock salt</emph> is the best for table salt. It should be washed, dried, pounded, sifted, and stored in a glass jar, and covered close. It is common to find it growing damp in the <emph rend="italic">salt stands</emph> for the table. It should then be set by the fire to dry, and afterwards be reduced to fine powder again. Nothing is more disagreeable than coarse or damp salt on a table.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Vinegar</emph> is best made of wine, or cider. Buy a keg, or half barrel of it, and set it in the cellar, and then keep a supply for the <implement>castors</implement> in a <implement>junk bottle</implement> in the kitchen. If too strong, it <emph rend="italic">eats</emph> the pickles.</p><p>Pickles never must be kept in glazed ware, as the vinegar forms a poisonous compound with the glazing.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Oil</emph> must be kept in the cellar. <emph rend="italic">Winter strained</emph> must be got in cold weather, as the <emph rend="italic">summer strained</emph> will not burn except in warm weather. <emph rend="italic">The best</emph> of <emph rend="italic">lard</emph> oil is preferred to every other by those who use it. Some lard oil is very poor.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Molasses,</emph> if bought by the barrel, or half barrel, should be kept in the cellar. Sugar bakers' is best for the table, and Porto Rico for cooking. If bought in small quantities, it should be kept in a <implement>demijohn.</implement> No vessel should be corked or bunged, if filled with molasses, as it will swell, and burst the vessel, or run over.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Hard Soap</emph> should be bought by large quantity, and laid to harden on a shelf, in a very dry place. It is<pb n="221" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=246"/>much more economical to buy hard, than soft soap, as those who use soft soap are very apt to waste it in using it, as they cannot do with hard soap.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Starch</emph> it is best to buy by a large quantity. It comes very nicely put up in papers, a pound or two in each paper, and packed in a box. Starch, which by the single pound is five cents a pound, if bought by the box, is only three cents a pound, and this makes a good deal of difference, in a large family, by the year. The high-priced starch is cheapest in the end.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Indigo</emph> is not always good. When a good lot is found by trial, it is best to get enough for a year or two, and store it in a tight tin box.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Coffee</emph> it is best to buy by the bag, as it improves by keeping. Let it hang in the bag, in a dry place, and it loses its rank smell and taste.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Tea,</emph> if bought by the box, is about five cents a pound cheaper than by small quantities. If well put up in boxes lined with lead, it keeps perfectly. But put up in paper, it soon loses its flavor. It therefore should, if in small quantities, be put in glass, or tin, and shut tight.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Saleratus</emph> should be bought in small quantities, then powdered, sifted, and kept tight corked in a large mouth glass bottle.</p><p>It grows damp if exposed to the air, and then cannot be used properly.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Raisins</emph> should not be bought in large quantities, as they are injured by time. It is best to buy the small boxes.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Currants</emph> for cake should be prepared as directed for cake, and set by for use in a jar.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Lemon</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Orange Peel</emph> should be dried, pounded, and set up in corked glass jars.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Allspice,</emph> should be pounded fine, and corked tight in small glass bottles with mouths large enough for a <implement>junk bottle</implement> cork, and then put in a tight tin box, made for the purpose. Or they can be put in small tin boxes with tight covers. Essences are as good as spices.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sweet Herbs</emph> should be dried, and the stalks thrown<pb n="222" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=247"/>away, and the rest be kept in corked large mouth bottles, or small tin boxes.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Cream Tartar, Citric</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Tartaric Acids, Bicarbonate of Soda,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Essences,</emph> should be kept in corked glass jars. Sal volatile must be kept in a large-mouth bottle, with a ground glass stopper to make it air-tight. Use cold water in dissolving it. It must be powdered.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Preserves</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Jellies</emph> should be kept in glass or stone, in a cool, dry place, well sealed, or tied with bladder covers. If properly made, and thus put up, they never will ferment. If it is difficult to find a cool, dry place, pack the jars in a box, and fill the interstices with sand, very thoroughly dried. It is best to put jellies in <implement>tumblers,</implement> or small glass jars, so as to open only a small quantity at a time.</p><p>The most easy way of keeping <emph rend="italic">Hams</emph> perfectly is to wrap and tie them in paper, and pack them in boxes or barrels with ashes. The ashes must fill all interstices, but must not touch the hams, as it absorbs the fat. It is much less labor, and quite as certain a mode as the one previously mentioned. It keeps them sweet, and protects from all kinds of insects.</p><p>After smoked beef, or ham, are cut, hang them in a coarse linen bag in the cellar, and tie it up to keep out flies.</p><p>Keep <emph rend="italic">Cheese</emph> in a cool, dry place, and after it is cut, wrap it in a linen cloth, and keep it in a tight tin box.</p><p>Keep <emph rend="italic">Bread</emph> in a tin covered box, and it will keep fresh and good longer than if left exposed to the air.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cake</emph> also should be kept in a tight tin box. Tin boxes made with covers like trunks, with handles at the ends, are best for bread and cake.</p><p>Smoked herring keep in the cellar.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Codfish</emph> is improved by changing it, once in a while, back and forth from garret to cellar. Some dislike to have it in the house anywhere.</p><p>All <emph rend="italic">salted provision</emph> must be watched, and kept under the brine. When the brine looks bloody, or smells badly, it must be scalded, and more salt put to it, and poured over the meat.</p><pb n="223" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=248"/><p>Salt fish barrels must not be kept near other food, as they impart a fishy smell and taste to it.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cabbages</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Turnips</emph> in the cellar often impart a bad smell to a house. All decayed vegetable matter should be kept out of a cellar, as it creates a miasma, that sometimes causes the most fatal diseases. Therefore, always take care of the vegetable bins, and have all that are decaying removed.</p><p>A cellar should be whitewashed often, to keep it sweet and clean.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="generalfood"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXIV.</hd><hd align="center">SUGGESTIONS IN REFERENCE TO PROVIDING A SUCCESSIVE VARIETY OF FOOD.</hd><p>By a little skill and calculation, a housekeeper may contrive to keep a constant change of agreeable varieties on her table, and that, too, without violating the rules either of health or economy. Some suggestions will be offered to aid in this object.</p><p>In the first place, much can be effected by keeping on hand a good supply of the various bread-stuffs. Good raised bread, of fine flour, must be the grand staple, but this may, every day, be accompanied with varieties of bread made of unbolted flour, or rye and Indian, or Indian alone, or potato and apple bread, or rice bread, or the various biscuits and rusk. It will be found that these are all more acceptable, if there are occasional changes, than if any one of them is continued a long time.</p><p>All the dough of these different kinds of bread, when light, can, with very little trouble, be made into drop cakes, or griddle cakes for breakfast, or tea, by adding some milk and eggs, and in some cases a little melted lard.</p><pb n="224" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=249"/><p>Very fine common cake is also easily made, at every baking, by taking some of the dough of bread and working in sugar, butter, and eggs, by the receipt given for Bread Cake and Child's Feather Cake. These can be made more or less sweet and rich at pleasure.</p><p>In the next place, a good supply of <emph rend="italic">fruit</emph> in the garden, and stored in the cellar, enables a housekeeper to keep up a constant variety. The directions given under the head of <emph rend="italic">Modes of Preparing Apples for the Tea Table,</emph> will be found very useful for this purpose, while those for preparing <emph rend="italic">Rice and Dry Bread</emph> are equally serviceable in helping out a cheap and convenient variety. There are some cheap dishes at the end also, which are very good, and easily made.</p><p>The directions for preparing <emph rend="italic">Hashes,</emph> also, are recommended as a mode of economizing, that is very acceptable when properly done. The little relishes obtained in summer from the garden, are very serviceable in securing varieties. Among these may be mentioned cucumbers, radishes, cabbage sprouts, Jerusalem artichokes, and tomatoes, all of which are very fine eaten with salt and vinegar.</p><p>Mush, hominy, tapioca, and rice cooked, and then, when cold, fried on a griddle, are great favorites. If salt pork rinds are used to grease the griddle, there will be so little fat used, that no injury to the most delicate stomachs can result from this mode of cooking.</p><p>In winter, the breakfast-table and tea-table can be supplied by a most inviting variety of muffins, griddle cakes, drop cakes, and waffles made of rice, corn meal, and unbolted flour, all of which are very healthful and very agreeable to the palate.</p><p>One mode of securing a good variety, in those months in spring when fruits and vegetables fail, is by a wise providence in drying and preserving fruits and vegetables. The following directions will aid in this particular.</p>

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXV.</hd><hd align="center">ON BREAD MAKING.</hd><p>FEW housekeepers are aware of their responsibility in reference to the <emph rend="italic">bread</emph> furnished for their family. As this is the principal article of food, there is no one thing on which the health of a family, especially of young children, is more dependant.</p><p>Baker's bread is often made of musty, sour, or other bad flour, which is made to look light, and the bad taste removed by unhealthy drugs. Of course, to the evil of unhealthy flour, is added unhealthy drugs, and there is no mode of discovering the imposition.</p><pb n="228" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=253"/><p>The only safe mode is, to have all bread made in the family, and to take all needful care that it shall uniformly be good.</p><p>Bread made of <emph rend="italic">salt,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">milk risings,</emph> is good only the first day, and to those accustomed to good <emph rend="italic">yeast bread,</emph> it is offensive to the smell, and not acceptable to the palate.</p><p>Bread made of sour milk, or buttermilk and an alkali, or made by mixing cream tartar in the flour, and an alkali in the wetting, is good as an occasional resort, in emergencies, when good yeast cannot be preserved, or when there is not time to wait for yeast rising.</p><p>But, as the ordinary bread for continued daily use, it is expensive, and not healthful or good like yeast bread. Some persons suffer from sore mouths and disordered stomachs, in consequence of eating it. Sometimes this is owing to the imperfect mixture of the materials. When the cream tartar is not <emph rend="italic">very</emph> thoroughly mixed with the flour, or when the alkali is not properly dissolved and thoroughly mixed, or when there is too much of either, the skin of the mouth and stomach are affected by the bread.</p><p>The only kind of bread which is always good for the health, and always acceptable to every palate, is sweet, well-raised, home-made <emph rend="italic">yeast bread.</emph> The <emph rend="italic">best</emph> kind of home-made yeast bread is an article of luxury to be found upon very few tables, and those who enjoy this comfort, know that there is no food upon earth, which is so good, or the loss of which is so much regretted.</p><p>In order to secure such bread, these three things are indispensable, viz.: <emph rend="italic">good flour, good yeast,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">good care.</emph></p><p>In order to secure good flour, it is best to try it <emph rend="italic">by tasting it,</emph> and you ordinarily can detect sourness or must. Buy a small quantity, and then, if it is found to be very superior, and it can be done conveniently, it is well to provide enough of it to last till the next crop of wheat affords new flour, when another supply for a year can be secured. Flour stored in barrels needs no other care than putting it in a cool, dry place, where it <pb n="229" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=254"/>is well protected from rats and cockroaches. A tight covered box made of thick plank, large enough to hold several barrels, with shelves to hold smaller supplies of other bread-stuffs, with a door in one side shutting very tight, is a perfect protection from rats, mice, and cockroaches.</p><p>Good flour has a yellowish tinge, and when pressed tight in the hand, retains the creases of the skin impressed on it. Poor flour is not thus adhesive; it can be blown about readily, and sometimes has a dingy look, as if ashes were mixed with it.</p><p>When good flour is found, <emph rend="italic">notice the brand,</emph> and seek the same next time. It is sometimes the case, however, that bad flour is passed off, by putting on the brands of persons who have gained a name as makers of superior flour. The only sure way is to try a small sample, and then get a larger supply, if it is good, from the same stock.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Grown</emph> wheat makes dough that is <emph rend="italic">runny,</emph> and cannot be well moulded, or make good bread. This can be discovered only by trial. <emph rend="italic">Smutty</emph> wheat makes flour that is very unhealthful.</p><p>Flour always should be <emph rend="italic">sifted</emph> before using it, to restore the lightness destroyed by packing, as well as to remove impurities. Bread is also more sure to be light, if the flour is heated before wetting. This can be done, by setting the <implement>kneading trough</implement> aslant before the fire, stirring it a little as it is warming. When bread proves to be bad, examine the yeast, and see also whether the oven bakes properly. If both are as they should be, and the bread is still poor, then the fault is in the flour, and it should be sent back and another supply obtained. And in buying flour, this liberty should always be secured, even if a higher price is the condition. No economy is so false as to try to save by means of bad bread. Medicine and doctors' bills soon show the folly of it.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Good yeast</emph> is as indispensable to good bread as good flour. Of the receipts given in this book, the one which will keep a month is the best. The one which<pb n="230" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=255"/>is made with fewer materials will not keep so well, but is more easily made.</p>
<p>In hot weather, when it is difficult to keep yeast, the hard yeast will be a great convenience. Some housekeepers who have tried both, prefer the flour hard yeast to that which is made with Indian meal, as it does not turn sour, as Indian does. Home-brewed yeast must be used for hard yeast, and not distillery or brewer's. Yeast, when it is good, is all in a foam, or else has large <emph rend="italic">beads</emph> on the surface, and its smell is brisk and pungent, but not sour. When poor, it sometimes smells sour, sometimes looks watery, and the sediment sinks to the bottom, and it has no froth or beads. Sometimes, when yeast does not look very good, it is improved by adding a tea-cup, or so, of flour, and two or three great spoonfuls of molasses, and setting it in a warm place to rise. Yeast must be kept in stone, or glass, with a tight cork, and the thing in which it is kept should often be scalded, and then warm water with a half teaspoonful of saleratus be put in it, to stand a while. Then rinse it with cold water. Sour yeast cannot be made good by saleratus.</p><p>The last grand essential to good bread is <emph rend="italic">good care.</emph> Unless the cook can be fully trusted, the mistress of a family <emph rend="italic">must</emph> take this care upon <emph rend="italic">herself.</emph> She must, if needful, stand by and see that the bread is wet right, that the yeast is good, that the bread is put where it is warm enough, that it does not rise too long, so as to lose its sweetness (which is often the case before it begins to turn sour), that it is moulded aright, that the oven is at the right heat, and that it is taken out at the right time, and then that it is put in the right place, and not set flat on to a greasy table, or painted shelf, to imbibe a bad taste.</p><p>Perhaps it may be thought that all this is a great drudgery, but it is worse drudgery to have sickly children, and a peevish husband, made so by having all the nerves of their stomachs rasped with sour, or heavy bread. A woman should be <emph rend="italic">ashamed</emph> to have poor bread, far more so, than to speak bad grammar, or to have a dress<pb n="231" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=256"/>out of the fashion. It is true, that, by accident, the best of housekeepers will now and then have poor bread, but then it is an accident, and one that rarely happens. When it is very frequently the case that a housekeeper has poor bread, she may set herself down as a <emph rend="italic">slack baked</emph> and negligent housekeeper.</p><p>It is very desirable that every family should have a constant supply of bread made of unbolted flour, or of rye and Indian. Most persons like to eat of it occasionally, and it tends to promote health. Warm cakes also, made of unbolted flour, are very excellent, and serviceable to health. The receipts for these articles in this work are first-rate. Warm raised bread cakes, of fine wheat, are not so healthy for breakfast, as those made of unbolted flour, Indian meal, rice, or tapioca. Griddle cakes, muffins, and waffles, made of these last articles, are more healthful than those made of fine wheat. If eaten at the right temperature (not above blood heat), and with but little butter, they are safe and harmless. Unbolted flour is good in almost any receipt in which fine flour is to be used, and many very much prefer it for all kinds of warm cakes. Brown bread, when light, makes good drop cakes, or good griddle cakes, by adding a little water or milk, and some eggs, and in some cases, a spoonful or two of molasses. Many cases are on record, of great changes for the better, in the health of individuals and communities, by the habitual use of food made of unbolted flour.</p><p>The style in which bread is prepared for the table, is a matter to be carefully attended to. In moulding up loaves and small cakes, do not leave lumps and loose flour adhering to the outside, but work them in thoroughly, so as to have the cake look fair and smooth. Wipe off flour from the outside before carrying to the table. Buttered pans are better than floured ones, because the cakes cleave off cleaner. When soda and saleratus are used, work it in thoroughly, or you will have those yellow spots and streaks, which look so disgusting, and show a slovenly negligence.</p><p>In the receipts for making bread, no particular direction<pb n="232" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=257"/>is given in regard to the time bread should stand after it is moulded and put in pans, because here is the point where observation and discretion are so indispensable, and rules are unavailing without. In hot weather, when the yeast is very good, and the bread very light, it must not stand over fifteen minutes after it is moulded, before setting in. If it is cold weather, and the yeast is less active, or the bread not perfectly raised, it may sometimes stand an hour in the pans without injury.</p><p>When it is risen in the pans so as to crack, it is ready for the oven, and if it stands after this it loses sweetness, and then turns sour. A great deal of bread is spoiled by standing too long after it is put in the pans. The only way to prevent this is for the housekeeper to ascertain, by experiment, how soon her yeast ordinarily raises bread to the right point, so as to make that full lightness which does not destroy the sweetness of the flour, and yet is complete. When this is secured, the bread should not stand more than fifteen minutes after moulding, unless it is very cold weather. Those who trust entirely to raising the bread after it is put into the pans, are much less likely to have the <emph rend="italic">best kind</emph> of bread, and far more risk is run than in the way here given.</p><p>In summer, if the milk is not new, it should be scalded, or the bread will turn sour by keeping. Bread is never as good which has turned sour, and been sweetened with saleratus, as if it had risen only just enough. In using saleratus, take a teaspoonful to each quart of wetting used; or, which is the same thing, a teaspoonful to four quarts of flour.</p><p>The proportion of yeast is about a tablespoonful of brewer's or distiller's yeast for every quart of wetting, or twice as much home-brewed yeast. In warm weather, pour the wetting boiling hot into the flour, and the bread keeps better. But be careful not to kill the yeast by putting it in before the mixture is sufficiently cooled. About <emph rend="italic">blood warmth</emph> is the right temperature.</p><p>The eastern brown bread rises faster than the wheat bread, and in hot weather cannot be made over night;<pb n="233" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=258"/>and if made with other bread, must be set to rise in a cool place.</p><p>It is always best to keep bread several hours before eating, until it can be cut without making it clammy. Biscuits, and small cakes of bread, are best baked in the morning to use for tea, and in the evening for breakfast. When cake is to be made of bread dough, it ought to be wet up with milk.</p><p>Most of the rules which have been given in other books for making cream tartar bread and cakes allow too much of the acid and alkali, and this affects the health.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Three pints</emph> of flour to one teaspoonful of soda and two of cream tartar is about right. Domestics are often careless in getting right proportions, and thus health is injured. It is probable that this can be remedied by getting an apothecary to combine the two powders in the right proportions when <emph rend="italic">very dry,</emph> and keeping them in a glass bottle, with a ground glass stopper, so as to be air-tight. The dampness of the air would make them combine, and neutralize them. There are yeast powders for sale of this kind. The way to use them is first to mix them thoroughly in the flour, and then put in the wetting.</p><p>In regard to yeast, the distillery rises fastest, the brewer's nearly as fast, and the home-brewed slowest of all. Sometimes distillery yeast will raise bread in an hour. Every housekeeper must learn by trial the time necessary to raise bread, and by this calculate the time to put her oven heating.</p><p>For large loaves of bread or cake, the oven must be heated with hard wood, so as to <emph rend="italic">soak</emph> thoroughly. For smaller things lighter wood is as good, and more economical. After a housekeeper has tried her oven, her yeast, and her oven wood, she can make out very minute directions for her domestics. But with poor domestics she ordinarily will need to persevere in superintending this matter herself, if she would always have good bread.</p></chapter>

The details will be given with great minuteness, that a novice may know exactly what to do in every particular.</p><p>It is generally the case, that, at dinner-parties for gentlemen, no ladies are present but those who are members of the family. The gentlemen of the house invites his friends the day previous, and then gives notice to his wife who are to come, and consults with her as to the articles to be provided, which of course he aids in purchasing.</p><p>The housekeeper then makes a list of all the articles to be used, either for table furniture or cooking, and then examines her cupboard, store-closet, and cellar, to see if everything is at hand and in order. All the glass and silver to be used is put in readiness, and the <implement>castors,</implement> salts, and everything of the kind arranged properly. In order to be more definite, the exact dishes to be provided will be supposed to be these:</p><p>Soup. Fish. A boiled ham. A boiled turkey, with oyster sauce. Three roasted ducks, and a dish of scolloped<pb n="235" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=260"/>oysters. Potatoes, Parsnips, Turnips, and Celery. For dessert, Pudding, Pastry, Fruit, and Coffee.</p><p>This will make a dinner for about ten or twelve persons. The pastry should be baked the day before, and the soup boiled down.</p><p>In the morning of the day for the dinner-party, every article should be on hand from market, and the cook have extra help, so as to get breakfast and the dishes out of the way early.</p><p>Then, the first thing, let her stuff and truss the turkey and ducks, and set them away to use when the time comes. Be sure that they are trussed so that the legs and wings will be tight to the body, and not come sprawling on to the table.</p><p>Suppose the dinner hour be three o'clock, as this is the earliest hour at which such a dinner could be comfortably prepared.</p><p>At nine o'clock, let the ham be washed, and put to boil. Then let the vegetables be prepared, ready for cooking. Next prepare the pudding. The pastry ought to be baked the day before. If not, it should be done very early in the morning, and be out of the way.</p><p>The pudding should be one of those put in the list of rich puddings, which does not require long baking or boiling. The receipt will be the guide as to time for cooking it. Next, prepare the oysters. One large cannister (or three pints) will be needed for the dish of scolloped oysters, and a small cannister (or a pint) will be needed for the sauce for the turkey. This last is simply drawn butter, with the oysters put in it, and simmered a few minutes. Be sure and follow the receipt for drawn butter exactly, as cooks are very apt to spoil this kind of sauce.</p><p>Put the turkey to boil at <emph rend="italic">one,</emph> if it is tender, as it ought to be, and sooner, if it is not. Put the ducks to roast at <emph rend="italic">two.</emph> Ducks are best cooked <emph rend="italic">rare,</emph> but the turkey must be boiled through entirely, so that all parts look the same color when carved.</p><p>The gravy for the ducks, and the drawn butter, must be prepared half an hour before taking up dinner. The<pb n="236" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=261"/>fish must be put to boil in a <implement>fish kettle.</implement> The time depends on the size.</p><p>The soup should be boiled down the day before. Let it be, for example, the receipt named <emph rend="italic">Macaroni Soup.</emph> In this case, any convenient time before dinner-time, put the macaroni to boil in a sauce-pan by itself, and when cooked enough, set it aside. Then, just before dinner is to be served, pour the cold soup into the kettle, add the seasoning and macaroni, and give it such a heat as just boils it for a minute or two, and then it is ready to serve.</p><p>The vegetables should be put to boil at such times as will have them cooked <emph rend="italic">just right</emph> at the dinner hour, and this the housekeeper must calculate, according to their size and age.</p><p>Unless there is an experienced cook, who can be trusted with everything, the lady of the house must superintend herself in the kitchen, until it is time for her to dress; and as the company will not arrive till the hour appointed, she can, by arranging her dress, all but <emph rend="italic">the finish,</emph> remain until it is nearly time to send up the dinner.</p>
<section><hd align="center" rend="italic">Setting the Table.</hd><p>The table should be set early in the forenoon, by the waiter, under the direction of the lady of the house, and in the manner exhibited in Fig. 7.</p><p>The table rug must first be laid exactly square with the room, and the tables also set exactly parallel with the sides of the room. If the tables are handsome ones, put on two white table-cloths, one above the other. If the tables are not handsome, cover them with a colored table-cloth, and put two white ones over.</p><p>Then set the <implement>castors</implement> in the exact centre of the table. Some prefer to have them on a side-table, and the waiter carry them around, but the table looks better to have them put in the centre. If they are put on the side-table, the celery stand may be placed in the centre of the table.</p><p>Next place the plates and knives as in Fig. 7, with a<pb n="237" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=262"/>napkin and <implement>tumbler</implement> at the right of each plate, as in the drawing. If it is cold weather, set the plates to warm, and leave them till wanted. Set the salt stands at the four corners, with two large spoons crossed by each, as in the drawing.</p><p>Then place table-mats in the places where the dishes are to be set. The host is to be seated at one end, and the hostess at the other, and at their plates put two knives and two forks. Put a <implement>carving knife</implement> and fork, and carver stand, at each place where a dish is to be carved. Put the jelly and pickles at diagonal corners, as marked on the drawing. If wine is to be used, put two wine-glasses by each <implement>tumbler.</implement> Just before dinner is to be served, a bit of bread, cut thick, is to be laid with a fork on each napkin.</p><p>Then prepare the side-table thus:</p><p>As the party, including host and hostess, will be twelve, there must be one dozen <implement>soup plates,</implement> and one dozen silver spoons. Then there must be two dozen large knives, and three dozen large plates, besides those on the table. This is to allow one plate for fish, and two for two changes of meat for each guest. Some would provide more. Then, there must be three dozen <implement>dessert plates,</implement> and two dozen dessert knives and forks. One dozen saucers, and one dozen <implement>dessert spoons.</implement> One or two extra of each kind, and three or four extra napkins, should be added for emergencies. (At a side stand, or closet, should be placed, at dinner-time, a wash dish of hot water, and two or three wiping towels.)</p><p>On the side-table, also, is to be placed all articles to be used in helping the dessert; and unless there is a convenient closet for the purpose, the dessert itself must be set there, and covered with napkins.</p><p>All the dishes and plates to be used, except those for desserts and soups, must, in cold weather, be set to warm by the waiter. If coffee is to be served at the dinner-table, the furniture for this must be put on the side-table, or in an adjacent room, or closet.</p></section>
<section><pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=263"/><hd align="center" rend="italic">Taking up the Dinner.</hd><p>Such a dinner as this cannot usually be prepared and served easily, without two to cook and serve in the kitchen, and two waiters in the dining-room. One waiter will answer, if he is experienced and expert in such matters.</p><p>When the hour for dinner arrives, let the cook first take up the soup and fish. The soup and <implement>soup plates</implement> are to be set by the hostess, and the spoons laid near. Potatoes and drawn butter, or fish sauce, are to be sent up with fish.</p><p>The fish is to be set before the host, and the fish knife and sauce placed by it, and then the waiter is to inform the lady of the house that dinner is ready. She rises, and informs her husband, or the guests, that dinner is ready, and then the gentleman for whom the party is made, or some other one of the invited guests, conducts the lady to the table, and takes his seat at the first plate at her right hand. She then helps the soup, beginning at the right, and passing it around in order, without inquiring whether each one wishes it. If any one prefers fish, he passes the soup to the next. Meantime the host either helps the fish to all who wish it, or leaves it covered till the soup is removed, and the plates changed. The plates for fish are set on, around the table, and the <implement>soup plates</implement> are set on to them, while soup is served.</p><p>While soup and fish are served above, the cook below proceeds thus:--The ham can be taken up some time before dinner, prepared for the table, and set aside, covered, as it is not injured by standing. Of course this is done at any convenient time. The turkey and ducks may first be taken up, prepared for table, and then covered, and set where they will be kept warm. Then the gravies and drawn butter are to be put in the gravy boats. The vegetables must be taken up the last thing, and the potatoes last of all, as the excellence of all depends on their being served hot, especially potatoes. Some would prepare a dish of mashed potatoes, but this<pb n="239" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=264"/>increases the complexity of the business, which should, as much as possible, be avoided.</p><p>After soup and fish, and the plates are removed by the waiters above, and clean plates put around, wine ore conversation will fill up the time, while the meats are brought on, which are to be placed on the table, covered, and in the order marked in the drawing, Fig.7.</p><p>When all are prepared, the host gives a sign to the waiters, and the covers are all to be removed, and so adroitly that no steam be spilt on the table-cloth or guests. To do this, the covers must be first inverted, <emph rend="italic">holding them directly over the dishes they cover,</emph> and this the hostess must teach the waiter to do beforehand, if need be. He is to be taught, also, to offer each article to guests on their <emph rend="italic">left</emph> side, to observe when guests have done eating, and then to change their plate, knife, and fork, and never to speak except to answer questions, or to offer the articles he serves.</p><p>The host carves the dish before him. The hostess helps the dish opposite to her, and the gentlemen guests carve the dishes opposite to them. As soon as ready to help, the lady asks the gentleman at her right to what he will be helped, and never makes excuses for, or praises any particular dish. The host commences at his right hand, and does the same, till all are helped. Every person begins to eat as soon as helped. The waiters are to observe if bread, water, or anything is wanting to any guest, and offer a supply. The hostess should, if possible, be at ease, so as to converse, and if she has occasion to direct the waiters (which, by previous instructions, should be avoided), she should do it as quietly and easily as possible. After all the guests are helped, the host helps the hostess, and then himself.</p><p>If wine is used, it is served by the host immediately after soup and fish, and any other times during the dinner he chooses. If the lady of the house is asked to drink wine, it is deemed uncourteous to refuse. She is expected to have a little poured into her glass, and raise it to her lips, looking at and slightly bowing to the guest who makes the request, and as soon as he has filled<pb n="240" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=265"/>his glass. Whenever any other makes the same request, a very little wine is to be poured into her glass, as the ceremony is incomplete without this.</p><p>After any guest has finished eating, the waiter is to change his plate, knife, and fork, and the host or hostess asks to what he will be helped.</p><p>Soon after all the guests are done eating meats, the hostess directs the waiter, and every article is removed from the table, and the upper table-cloth taken off. Then the dessert knives, forks, and plates are set around, and the dessert is placed on the table. The pudding is to be set on a mat, before the hostess, and the dish of cheese before the host, and the pastry arranged in some regular order on the table, with knives and forks to help. These are divided and distributed by the host and hostess, assisted by the guests.</p><p>When these are finished, everything is removed again, and the other table-cloth taken off, leaving the bare table, or the colored cloth. Then the fruit is set on. After fruit, the coffee is brought to the table, or the company retire to the drawing-room, and take their coffee there.</p><p>Such a dinner-party as the above, may be got up and carried through comfortably by a housekeeper, if she is provided with an experienced cook and well-trained waiter. But without these, it is absolute <emph rend="italic">cruelty</emph> for a husband to urge, or even to allow his wife to go through all the toil, anxiety, and effort needful for such an affair.</p><p>In all cases, it would be more consistent with the laws of health, and thus with the laws of God, to have a dinner including far less variety, and it is hoped that as true Christianity and true refinement advance, that the reform in regard to <emph rend="italic">eating</emph> will advance, like the temperance reform in regard to drinking.</p><p>When men become so refined and cultivated, that they can supply wit and good sense, instead of the overflows induced by the excitement of wine, diluted by<pb n="241" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=266"/>the stupidity resulting from excess in eating, a housekeeper will find the giving of a dinner-party a very different matter from what it ordinarily is found to be. As dining parties are often conducted, the number, and variety, and character of the dishes offered, tempt to an excess, which overloads the stomach, and thus stupifies the brain; so that all the wit and brilliancy that is obtained, is the simple product of <emph rend="italic">vinous fermentation.</emph></p></section>
<section><hd align="center" rend="italic">Tea Parties and Evening Company.</hd><p>In one respect, fashion has aided to relieve a housekeeper of much care in providing evening entertainments. It is now fashionable to spread a table for evening parties, and not to serve tea and coffee, as was formerly done. As this is the easiest, and most rational way of entertaining evening company, no other method will be so minutely described.</p><p>If a lady designs to invite from forty to sixty friends to pass the evening, or even to have a much larger company invited, the following would be called a plain but genteel arrangement, for company in New York, Philadelphia, or any of our large cities.</p><p>Set a long table in the dining-room, and cover it with a handsome damask cloth. Set some high article containing flowers, or some ornamental article, in the centre. Set <implement>Champagne glasses</implement> with flowers at each corner. Set loaves of cake at regular distances, and dispose in some regular order about the table, preserves, jellies, lemonade, and any other articles that may be selected from the abundant variety offered in the collection of Receipts for Evening Parties in this book.</p><p>Where a very large company is to be collected, and a larger treat is thought to be required, then a long table is set in the centre of the room, as above, and on it are placed cakes, pastry, jellies, and confectionary. Then smaller tables are set each side of a mantle, or in corners, one of which is furnished with sandwiches, oysters, salad, celery, and wine, and the other with coffee, chocolate, and lemonade. Sometimes all are placed on one<pb n="242" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=267"/>long table, and in this case, cakes, jellies, and confectionary are put in the centre, coffee and lemonade at one end, and oysters, sandwiches, celery, and wines at the other. A great deal of taste may be displayed in preparing and arranging such a table.</p><p>As it is often the case, that the old mode of serving tea and coffee will be resorted to, one modificaton is proposed, which decreases the labour and anxiety to the housekeeper, and increases the enjoyment of the company. It is this. Set a table in one of the parlors, and cover it with a damask cloth. Let the tea and coffee be served at this table, the lady of the house presiding. Then let the gentlemen wait upon the ladies around the room, and then help themselves. This is particularly convenient when it is difficult to get good waiters.</p><p>Most of the articles used for evening parties (with the exception of rich cakes, wine, and high-seasoned chicken salad) are not unhealthful, if taken moderately.</p><p>When these parties break up at seasonable hours, they may prove one of the most rational and harmless modes of securing social enjoyment; but when connected with highly exciting amusements, and late hours, they are sure to wear upon the constitution and health, and rational and conscientious persons, for these and other reasons, will avoid them.</p></section></chapter>

A housekeeper ought, therefore, to attend carefully to these particulars.</p><p>The table-cloth should always be <emph rend="italic">white,</emph> and well washed and ironed. When taken from the table, it should be folded in the ironed creases, and some heavy article laid on it. A heavy bit of plank, smoothed and kept for the purpose, is useful. By this method, the table-cloth looks tidy much longer than when it is less carefully laid aside.</p><p>Where table napkins are used, care should be taken to keep the same one to each person, and in laying them aside, they should be folded so as to hide the soiled places, and laid under pressure.</p><p>The table-cloth should always be put on <emph rend="italic">square,</emph> and right side upward. The articles of furniture should be placed as exhibited in figures 7 and 8.</p><p>The bread for breakfast and tea should be cut in even, regular slices, not over a fourth of an inch thick, and all crumbs removed from the bread plate. They should be piled in a regular form, and if the slices are large, they should be divided.</p><p>The butter should be cooled in cold water, if not already hard, and then cut into a smooth and regular form, and a butter knife be laid by the plate, to be used for no other purpose but to help the butter.</p><p>Small mats, or cup plates, should be placed at each plate, to receive the <implement>tea-cup,</implement> when it would otherwise be set upon the table-cloth and stain it.</p><pb n="244" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=269"/><illustration><caption>Fig. 7.</caption><description>An illustration of a table correctly set for dinner, with lettered areas referred to in the below list.</description></illustration><p><table columns="3"><row><cell>A, Castors.</cell><cell>F, Scolloped Oysters.</cell><cell>K, Parsnips.</cell></row><row><cell>B, Boiled Turkey.</cell><cell>G, Boiled Ham.</cell><cell>PP,Pickles.</cell></row><row><cell>C, Oyster Sauce.</cell><cell>H.

Then they should be drained, and brought to the table, and seasoned the last thing.</p><p>The water should be drained thoroughly from all greens and salads.</p><p>There are certain articles which are usually set on together, because it is <emph rend="italic">the fashion,</emph> or because they are <emph rend="italic">suited</emph> to each other.</p><p>Thus with <emph rend="italic">strong-flavored meats,</emph> like mutton, goose, and duck, it is customary to serve the strong-flavored vegetables, such as onions and turnips. Thus, turnips are put in mutton broth, and served with mutton, and onions are used to stuff geese and ducks. But onions are usually banished from the table and from cooking, on account of the disagreeable flavor they impart to the atmosphere and breath.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Boiled Poultry</emph> should be accompanied with boiled ham, or tongue.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Boiled Rice</emph> is served with poultry as a vegetable.</p> <p><emph rend="italic">Jelly</emph> is served with mutton, venison, and roasted meats, and is used in the gravies for hashes.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fresh Pork</emph> requires some acid sauce, such as cranberry, or tart apple sauce.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Drawn Butter,</emph> prepared as in the receipt, with eggs in it, is used with boiled fowls and boiled fish.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Pickles</emph> are served especially with fish, and <emph rend="italic">Soy</emph> is a<pb n="246" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=271"/>fashionable sauce for fish, which is mixed on the plate with drawn butter.</p><p>There are modes of <emph rend="italic">garnishing dishes,</emph> and preparing them for table, which give an air of taste and refinement, that pleases the eye.</p><p>Thus, in preparing a dish of fricasseed fowls, or stewed fowls, or cold fowls warmed over, small cups of boiled rice can be laid inverted around the edge of the platter, to eat with the meat.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sweetbreads</emph> fried brown in lard, and laid around such a dish, give it a tasteful look.</p><p>On <emph rend="italic">Broiled Ham,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Veal,</emph> eggs boiled, or fried and laid, one on each piece, look well.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Greens</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Asparagus</emph> should be well drained, and laid on buttered toast, and then slices of boiled eggs be laid on the top, and around.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Hashes,</emph> and preparations of pig's and calve's head and feet, should be laid on toast, and garnished with round slices of lemon.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Curled Parsley,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Common Parsley,</emph> is a pretty garnish, to be fastened to the shank of a ham, to conceal the bone, and laid around the dish holding it. It looks well laid around any dish of cold slices of tongue, ham, or meat of any kind.</p><p>The proper mode of setting a dinner-table is shown at Fig. 7, and the proper way of setting a tea-table is shown at Fig. 8. In this drawing of a tea-table, smallsized plates are set around, with a knife, napkin, and cup plate laid by each, in a regular manner, while the articles of food are to be set, also, in regular order. On the <implement>waiter</implement> are placed the <implement>tea-cups</implement> and saucers, <implement>sugar bowl,</implement> slop bowl, cream cup, and two or three articles for tea, coffee, and water, as the case may be. This drawing may aid some housekeepers in teaching a domestic how to set a tea-table, as the picture will assist the memory in some cases.

In order to aid those who are novices in these matters, the following outlines are furnished by an accomplished housekeeper. They are the details of family work, in a family of ten persons, where a cook, chambermaid, and boy, are all the domestics employed, and where the style of living is plain, but every way comfortable. The mistress of this family arranges the work for each domestic, and writes it on a large card, which is suspended in the kitchen for guidance and reference. On hiring a new cook, or chambermaid, these details are read to her, and the agreement made, with a full understanding, on both sides, of what is expected.

Wash them in suds as hot as you can bear your hand in, and wipe them dry with a cloth kept clean for the purpose, and used for nothing else. Be careful not to fill them full, lest the oil swell and run over. Screw them very tight, and see that the little air-hole is kept open, or the lamp will not burn.</p><p>Wash the outside of the oil filler, and wipe the scissors clean. Wash the cloths used in fresh, clean suds, dry them, and then put them in their place. Wipe the basin used, and put it in its place.</p><p>After cleaning the lamps, wash and scour the knives, thus:</p><p>Wash them first, and be careful not to put the handles in the water. Wipe them dry, and then scour them with Bath brick, and a cork dipped in soft soap. Never rub a knife on a board in scouring it, as it wears out very fast.</p><p>After scouring, do not wash them, but wipe them with a dry cloth, and be careful to get the brick out from between the fork tines. Use a small stick prepared for the purpose. If the handles are soiled by scouring, wipe them with a damp cloth.</p><p>Lay the large knives in one side of the knife basket, and the small ones the other side, and put the handles of the knives one way, and the handles of the forks the opposite way.</p><p>Always fill the <implement>boiler</implement> after you take out dish water, lest the cook be disturbed by your neglecting it.</p><p>Arrange the china-closet in order, after putting up the breakfast dishes. Dishes not often used must be wiped when used.</p><p>In doing chamber-work, turn up the vallance of the beds, set the windows open, brush down cobwebs, move every moveable article, to sweep under it, and <emph rend="italic">sweep with short strokes.</emph></p><pb n="250" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=275"/><p>Always hang the cloths kept for wiping bowls and pitchers on the towel frames, and use them for nothing else.</p><p>Have a dust cloth with a loop for every room, and put it in the wash once a fortnight.</p><p>Wash the breakfast dishes thus:--Rinse the cups, scrape the plates very clean, put the bits of butter on the <implement>butter plate,</implement> and empty all the slops into the slop bowl, and then empty it.</p><p>First wash the glass things with a swab in suds, as hot as possible, wiping each one as soon as taken out of the water. When glass is very cold, put a little warm water in it before putting it into the hot suds, or you will crack it.</p><p>Next wash the silver and Britannia, wiping each as soon as taken out. Then wash the other articles.</p><p>Keep the <implement>castors</implement> bright and clean, and well filled. Wipe the salt spoons dry, and do not lay them so as to touch the salt.

But the fact of having them written, and the reading of them over to all new-comers, as what is expected of them, and occasional reference to them, as what was agreed on when making the bargain, often will be of much service. And it is an aid to the housekeeper herself, who is liable to forget many things in teaching new-comers their duties.</p></section><pb n="251" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=276"/>
<section><hd align="center" rend="italic">Odds and Ends.</hd><p>There are certain <emph rend="italic">odds and ends,</emph> where every housekeeper will gain much by having a <emph rend="italic">regular time</emph> to attend to them. Let this time be the last Saturday forenoon in every month, or any other time more agreeable, but let there be a <emph rend="italic">regular fixed time</emph> once a month, in which the housekeeper will attend to the following things:</p><p>First, go around to every room, drawer, and closet in the house, and see what is out of order, and what needs to be done, and make arrangements as to time and manner of doing it.</p><p>Second, examine the store-closet, and see if there is a proper supply of all articles needed there.</p><p>Third, go to the cellar, and see if the salted provision, vegetables, pickles, vinegar, and all other articles stored in the cellar are in proper order, and examine all the preserves and jellies.</p><p>Fourth, examine the trunk, or closet of family linen, and see what needs to be repaired and renewed.</p><p>Fifth, see if there is a supply of dish towels, dish cloths, bags, holders, floor cloths, dust cloths, wrapping paper, twine, lamp-wicks, and all other articles needed in kitchen work.</p><p>Sixth, count over the spoons, knives, and forks, and examine all the various household utensils, to see what need replacing, and what should be repaired.</p><p>A housekeeper who will have <emph rend="italic">a regular time</emph> for attending to these particulars, will find her whole family machinery moving easily and well; but one who does not, will constantly be finding something out of joint, and an unquiet, secret apprehension of duties left undone, or forgotten, which no other method will so effectually remove.</p><p>A housekeeper will often be much annoyed by the accumulation of articles not immediately needed, that must be saved for future use. The following method, adopted by a thrifty housekeeper, may be imitated with advantage. She bought some cheap calico, and made<pb n="252" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=277"/>bags of various sizes, and wrote the following labels with indelible ink on a bit of broad tape, and sewed them on one side of the bags:--<emph rend="italic">Old Linens; Old Cottons; Old Black Silks; Old Colored Silks; Old Stockings; Old Colored Woollens; Old Flannels; New Linen; New Cotton; New Woollens; New Silks; Pieces of Dresses; Pieces of Boys' Clothes, &amp;c.</emph> These bags were hung around a closet, and filled with the above articles, and then it was known where to look for each, and where to put each when not in use.</p><p>Another excellent plan is for a housekeeper once a month to make out <emph rend="italic">a bill of fare</emph> for the four weeks to come. To do this, let her look over this book, and find out what kind of dishes the season of the year and her own stores will enable her to provide, and then make out a list of the dishes she will provide through the month, so as to have an agreeable variety for breakfasts, dinners, and suppers. Some systematic arrangement of this kind at regular periods will secure great comfort and enjoyment to a family.</p></section></chapter>
<chapter class1="household"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXIX.</hd><hd align="center">ON A PROPER SUPPLY OF UTENSILS AND CONVENIENCES FOR HOUSEKEEPING.</hd><p>WHAT is the proper supply of kitchen utensils, depends very much on the style of living adopted, and on the character of the domestics employed. Where a person's means are small, there must be a sacrifice of <emph rend="italic">time</emph> and <emph rend="italic">convenience</emph> to save expense; and where domestics are in such habits that no proper care will be taken of utensils, the supply must be more limited.</p><p>But where a housekeeper has abundant means, and where she can, by a reasonable effort, secure proper attention to the care of utensils, it greatly contributes<pb n="253" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=278"/>to the ease and success of housekeeping to have a full supply of them. And there is much economy, both of time and comfort, in securing such a supply. Where there are a few utensils, and these are to be used for a great variety of purposes, there is a loss of time in stopping to clean articles used for one thing, when wanted for another; there is a loss of time in running about to look for them; and there is a loss of <emph rend="italic">patience</emph> in finding them out of the way at just the wrong time, so that good success is often thus entirely prevented.</p><p>Moreover, many processes of cooking and housekeeping are performed with much more success, when the cook is well provided with suitable utensils; while the use of the same article for various kinds of dishes, or for different modes of cooking, often destroys the delicate flavor of food, and makes all dishes taste very much alike. This is the case often, in steam and canal boats, where every article on the table seems to have imbibed one and the same flavor.</p><p>In pointing out the various conveniences to be used in housekeeping, reference will be had to those chiefly who have means to purchase everything they deem useful, and also who can obtain such domestics, that proper care will be taken of whatever is provided.</p><p>In the Domestic Economy at p. 319, is a list embracing a <emph rend="italic">full supply</emph> of all those articles which some of the best housekeepers in our country deem useful and desirable, for the various processes of housekeeping, in a family of <emph rend="italic">medium</emph> size, and of abundant means; where everything is done for <emph rend="italic">comfort,</emph> and nothing for <emph rend="italic">show.</emph></p><hd align="center" rend="italic">Kitchen Furniture.</hd><p>The kitchen floor should be covered with an <implement>oil cloth.</implement> Carpets, or bits of carpet, are not so good, because of the grease and filth that must accumulate in them, and the labor of sweeping, shaking, and cleansing them. Nothing is cleansed so easily as an <implement>oil cloth,</implement> and it is much better than a painted floor, because it can be removed to be painted.</p><pb n="254" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=279"/><p>If the cook is troubled with cold feet in winter, small bits of carpeting can be laid where she sits and stands the most. Otherwise they had better be kept out of the kitchen.</p><p>Directions for preparing a <implement>kitchen oil cloth</implement> will be found page 317 of the Domestic Economy.</p><p>There should always be a clock in the kitchen, as indispensable to success in cooking, and regularity of meals.</p><p>Two tables, a large one for cooking, and a small one for meals, should be provided.</p><p>Besides this, a settee ironing-table is a very great comfort and convenience, which is represented at Fig. 9, and is a better pattern than the one described in the Domestic Economy.</p><illustration><caption>Fig. 9.</caption><description>An illustration of a settee ironing table with lettered areas referred to in the text.</description></illustration><p>The back is made to turn on pivots at CC, and rests when turned on the sides. At AA, are projections, with a hole that meets the holes in the sides at BB, and then the peg at E is put in to hold it firmly. The box, or seat, is divided into two parts, with lids at DD, and in these boxes are kept, on one side the <implement>ironing sheet,</implement> wipers and holders, and on the other side, the irons, rings, &amp;c., used in ironing. When the back is not used for ironing, it is put down, and the article is a good settee, and if provided with cushions, is as comfortable as most parlor sofas. It can be put on <implement>castors,</implement> and have handles at the sides, and then it can be moved up to the fire winter evenings for use; the back serving both to reflect the warmth of the fire, and to keep off draughts of air.</p>
<pb n="255" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=280"/><p>The following are the dimensions. Length, six feet. Width of seat, twenty inches.

The ends of the sofa have grooved slides for the head and foot boards to slide in, as at C C, and have brown linen nailed on both inside and outside, on which to fasten the sofa cover. Two thick cushions of hair, or of moss and cotton, are made, one to serve for the seat, one to set up against the back. These serve for the bed when the back is laid down.

<chapter class1="servants"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXX.</hd><hd align="center">SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO HIRED SERVICE.</hd><p>THERE is no subject on which young housekeepers need wisdom and instruction more, than in regard to the <emph rend="italic">management of domestics,</emph> and therefore some farther suggestions will be offered, in addition to those presented in the Domestic Economy.</p><p>Success in the management of domestics very much depends upon the <emph rend="italic">manners</emph> of a housekeeper towards them. And here, two extremes are to be avoided. One is a severe and imperious mode of giving orders and finding fault, which is inconsistent both with lady-like good breeding, and with a truly amiable character. Few domestics, especially American domestics, will long submit to it, and many a good one has been lost, simply by the influence of this unfortunate manner.</p><p>The other extreme is apt to result from the great difficulty<pb n="270" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=295"/>of retaining good domestics. In cases where this is experienced, there is a liability of becoming so fearful of displeasing one who is found to be good, that, imperceptibly, the relation is changed, and the domestic becomes the mistress. A housekeeper thus described this change in one whom she hired: "The first year she was an excellent servant; the second year, she was a kind mistress; the third year, she was an intolerable tyrant!"</p><p>There is no domestic so good that she will not be injured by perceiving that, through dependance upon her, and a fear of losing her services, the mistress of the family gives up her proper authority and control.</p><p>The happy medium is secured, by a course of real kindness in manner and treatment, attended with the manifestation of a calm determination, that the plans and will of the <emph rend="italic">housekeeper,</emph> and not of the domestic, shall control the family arrangements.</p><p>When a good domestic <emph rend="italic">first</emph> begins to insist that her views and notions shall be regarded, rather than those of the housekeeper, a kind but firm stand must be taken. A frank conversation should be sought, at a time when nothing has occurred to ruffle the temper on either side. Then the housekeeper can inquire what would be the view taken of this matter in case the domestic herself should become a housekeeper, and hire a person to help her; and when the matter is set before her mind in this light, let the "golden rule" be applied, and ask her whether she is not disposed to render to her present employer what she herself would ask from a domestic in similar circumstances.</p><p>Much trouble of this kind is saved by hiring persons <emph rend="italic">on trial,</emph> in order to ascertain whether they are willing and able to do the work of the family in the manner which the housekeeper wishes; and in this case, such written cards as have been exhibited in previous pages can be read, or some member of the family can go around for a day or two, and show how everything is to be done.</p><p>There is no department of domestic life where a woman's temper and patience are so sorely tried, as in the<pb n="271" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=296"/><emph rend="italic">incompetence</emph> and constant <emph rend="italic">changes</emph> of domestics. And therefore, there is no place where a reasonable and Christian woman will be more watchful, careful, and conscientious.</p><p>The cultivation of <emph rend="italic">patience</emph> will be much promoted by keeping in mind these considerations in reference to the <emph rend="italic">incompetence</emph> and other failings of those who are hired.</p><p>In the first place, consider that the great object of life to us is not <emph rend="italic">enjoyment,</emph> but the <emph rend="italic">formation of a right character;</emph> that such a character cannot be formed, except by <emph rend="italic">discipline,</emph> and that the trials and difficulties of domestic life, if met in a proper spirit and manner, will, in the end, prove blessings rather than evils, by securing a measure of elevation, dignity, patience, self-control, and benevolence, that could be gained by no other methods. The comfort gained by these virtues, and the rewards they bring, both in this and in a future life, are a thousand-fold richer than the easy, indolent life of indulgence, which we should choose for ourselves.</p><p>In the next place, instead of allowing the mind to dwell on the <emph rend="italic">faults</emph> of those who minister to our comfort and convenience, cultivate a habit of making every possible benevolent allowance and palliation. Say to yourself--"Poor girl! she has never been instructed, either by parents or employers. Nobody has felt any interest in the formation of her habits, or kindly sought to rectify her faults. Why should I expect her to do those things well which no one has taken any care to teach her? She has no parent or friend now to aid her but myself. Let me bear her faults patiently, and kindly try to cure them."</p><p>If a woman will cultivate the spirit expressed in such language, if she will benevolently seek the best good of those she employs, if she will interest herself in giving them instruction, if they need it, and good books to read if they are already qualified to understand them, if she will manifest a desire to have them made comfortable in the kitchen, and in their chambers, she certainly will receive her reward, and that in many ways. She will<pb n="272" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=297"/>be improving her own character, she will set a good example to her family, and in the end, she will do something, and in some cases <emph rend="italic">much,</emph> to improve the character and services of those whom she hires. And the good done in this way goes down from generation to generation, and goes also into the eternal world, to be known and rejoiced in, when every earthly good has come to an end.</p><p>It is sometimes the case, that the constant change of domestics, and the liability thus to have dishonest ones, makes it needful to keep stores under lock and key. This measure is often very offensive to those who are hired, as it is regarded by them as an evidence both of <emph rend="italic">closeness</emph> and of <emph rend="italic">suspicion</emph> of their honesty.</p><p>In such cases, it is a good plan, when first making an agreement with a domestic, to state the case in this way. That you have had dishonest persons in the family, and that when theft is committed, it is always a cause of disquiet to <emph rend="italic">honest</emph> persons, because it exposes them to suspicion. You can then state your reasons as two-fold: one to protect yourself from pilfering when you take entire strangers, and the other is to protect honest persons from being suspected. When the matter is thus presented, at first hiring a person, no offence will be taken afterwards.</p><p>In some portions of our country, the great influx of foreigners of another language and another faith, and the ready entrance they find as domestics into American families, impose peculiar trials and peculiar duties on American housekeepers. In reference to such, it is no less our interest than our duty to cultivate a spirit of kindness, patience, and sympathy.</p><p>Especially should this be manifested in reference to their <emph rend="italic">religion.</emph> However wrong, or however pernicious we may regard their system of faith, we should remember, that they have been trained to believe that it is what God commands them to obey, and so long as they do believe this, we should respect them for their conscientious scruples, and not try to tempt them to do what they suppose to be wrong. If we lead an ignorant and<pb n="273" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=298"/>feeble mind to do what it believes to be wrong, in regard to the most sacred of all duties, those owed to God, how can we expect them to be faithful to us?</p><p>The only lawful way to benefit those whom we regard as in an error, is, not to tempt them to do what they believe to be wrong, but to give them <emph rend="italic">the light of knowledge,</emph> so that they may be qualified to judge for themselves. And the way to make them willing to receive this light, is <emph rend="italic">to be kind to them.</emph> We should take care that their feelings and prejudices should in no way be abused, and that they be treated as we should wish to be, if thrown as strangers into a strange land, among a people of different customs and faith, and away from parents, home, and friends.</p><p>Remember that our Master, who is in heaven, especially claims to be the God of the widow, the fatherless, and <emph rend="italic">the stranger,</emph> and has commanded, "If a stranger sojourn with you in your land, ye shall not vex him, but the stranger that dwelleth among you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself."</p><p>There is one rule, which every housekeeper will find of incalculable value, not only in the case of domestics, but in the management of children, and that is, never to find fault <emph rend="italic">at the time that a wrong thing is done.</emph> Wait until you are unexcited yourself, and until the vexation of the offender is also past, and then, when there is danger of a similar offence, <emph rend="italic">forewarn,</emph> and point out the evils already done for want of proper care in this respect.</p></chapter>

Yet this correct taste is sometimes found in minds that have enjoyed but few advantages, but by nature are endowed with <emph rend="italic">refined feelings</emph> and <emph rend="italic">good common sense.</emph></p><p>Where this good taste exists, it leads a woman to wish to have her house, furniture, and style of living, in all its parts, exactly conformed to <emph rend="italic">her means,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">her situation.</emph> If she is not rich, she will not wish to have a house, or furniture, or dress like those who are rich, and will find a pride and pleasure in making a small house, plain furniture, simple dress, and an economical table, so neat, and orderly, and comfortable, and tasteful, as to ensure comfort and satisfaction to all around her. If she cannot command good domestics, nor live comfortably in a house, and with furniture which requires them, she will aim to alter the style of her establishment, and adopt one which can be thoroughly and successfully carried out by such domestics as she can obtain.</p><p>Where good domestics are scarce, it is a very great mistake to attempt to live in <emph rend="italic">a large house.</emph> The labor of house cleaning, and window cleaning, the sweeping, the care of furniture, and many other items of labor, are much increased by enlarging the size of the house. In the country, where good help is scarce, a house on the plan of one of the cottages drawn in the Domestic Economy, with <emph rend="italic">bed presses</emph> instead of chambers, will be found to be a great saving of labor, and the expense that might be incurred in building, furnishing, and taking care of chambers, can be laid out in making<pb n="275" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=300"/>conveniences for carrying water, and furnishing the kitchen properly. The drawings for this purpose in the Domestic Economy will be found useful in this respect.</p><p>In cities, nothing is more pernicious to a housekeeper's health, than going up and down stairs, and a woman who has good taste and good sense, will not, for the sake of <emph rend="italic">show,</emph> keep <emph rend="italic">two</emph> parlors on the ground floor and her nursery above and kitchen below. One of these parlors will be taken for her nursery and bedroom, even should all her acquaintance wonder how it <emph rend="italic">can</emph> be, that a wife and mother should think her health and duties of more importance than two dark parlors shut up for company.</p><p>When a woman has good sense and good taste, these are some of the things she will not do.</p><p>She will not be so anxious to obtain admission into any circle as to seek it by a conformity to its fashions, which will involve her in labor, or expenses that lessen domestic comfort, or are inappropriate to her income.</p><p>She will not be particularly anxious to know what the fashion is, in dress and furniture, nor give up any important duty or pursuit to conform to it. Nor will she be disturbed if found deficient in these particulars, nor disturb others by making apologies, or giving reasons.</p><p>She will not, while all that is <emph rend="italic">in sight</emph> to visiters, or to out-door observers, is in complete order, and in expensive style, have her underclothing, her bedroom, her kitchen, and her nursery ill furnished, and all in disorder. She will not attempt to show that she is genteel, and belongs to the aristocracy, by a display of profusion, by talking as if she was indifferent to the cost of things, or by seeming ashamed to economize. These things are marks of a vulgar, unrefined person, that fancies that it is <emph rend="italic">money</emph>, and not <emph rend="italic">character,</emph> that makes the lady. And by persons of education and refinement, such things are always regarded as indicating a vulgar, uncultivated mind.</p><p>Let a young housekeeper, then, adopt these maxims as her guide in regulating the style of her dress, furniture, table, and the size of her house.</p><pb n="276" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=301"/><p>Do not begin housekeeping in the style in which you should end it, but begin on a plain and small scale, and increase your expenditures as your experience and means are increased.</p><p>Be determined to live <emph rend="italic">within</emph> your income, and in such a style that you can secure time to improve your own mind, and impart some of your own advantages to others.</p><p>Try to secure <emph rend="italic">symmetry</emph> in your dress, furniture, style of living, and charities. That is, do not be profuse in one direction, and close and pinching in another.</p><p>Cultivate a taste for <emph rend="italic">intellectual</emph> pleasures, <emph rend="italic">home</emph> pleasures, and the pleasures of <emph rend="italic">benevolence.</emph></p><p>Have some <emph rend="italic">regular plan</emph> for the employment of your time, and in this plan have chief reference to making home pleasant to your husband and children. It will save them from a thousand snares, and you from many sorrows.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="household"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXXII.</hd><hd align="center">WORDS OF COMFORT FOR A DISCOURAGED HOUSEKEEPER.</hd><p>THERE is no doubt of the fact, that American housekeepers have far greater trials and difficulties to meet than those of any other nation. And it is probable that many of those who may read over the methods of thrift and economy adopted by some of the best housekeepers in our land, and detailed in this work, will with a sigh exclaim, that it is <emph rend="italic">impossible</emph> for them even to attempt any such plans.</p><p>Others may be stimulated by the advice and examples presented, and may start off with much hope and courage, to carry out a plan of great excellence and appropriateness, and after trying a while, will become discouraged<pb n="277" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=302"/>by the thousand obstacles in their way, and give up in despair.</p><p>A still greater number will like their own way best, and think it is folly to attempt to change.</p><p>For those who wish they <emph rend="italic">could</emph> become systematic, neat, and thorough housekeepers, and would like to follow out successfully the suggestions found in this work, and for those who have tried, or will try, and find themselves baffled and discouraged, these words of comfort are offered.</p><p>Perhaps you find yourself encompassed by such sort of trials as these. Your house is inconvenient, or destitute of those facilities for doing work well which you need, and you cannot command the means to supply these deficiencies. Your domestics are so imperfectly qualified that they never can do anything <emph rend="italic">just right,</emph> unless you stand by and attend to everything yourself, and you cannot be present in parlor, nursery, and kitchen all at once. Perhaps you are frequently left without any cook, or without a chambermaid, and sometimes without any hands but your own to do the work, and there is constant jostling and change from this cause. And perhaps you cannot get supplies, either from garden or market, such as you need, and all your calculations fail in that direction.</p><p>And perhaps your children are sickly, and rob you of rest by night, or your health is so poor that you feel no energy, or spirits to make exertions. And perhaps you never have had any training in domestic affairs, and cannot understand how to work yourself, nor how to direct others. And when you go for aid to experienced housekeepers, or cookery books, you are met by such sort of directions as these: "Take a <emph rend="italic">pinch</emph> of this, and a <emph rend="italic">little</emph> of that, and <emph rend="italic">considerable</emph> of the other, and cook them till they are done <emph rend="italic">about right."</emph> And when you cannot succeed in following such indefinite instructions, you find your neighbors and husband wondering how it is, that when you have one, two, or three domestics, there should be so much difficulty about housekeeping, and such constant trouble, and miscalculation, and mistake.<pb n="278" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=303"/>And then, perhaps, you lose your patience and your temper, and blame others, and others blame you, and so everything seems to be in a snarl.</p><p>Now the first thing to be said for your comfort is, that you <emph rend="italic">really have</emph> great trials to meet; trials that entitle you to pity and sympathy, while it is the fault of others more than your own, that you are in this very painful and difficult situation. You have been as cruelly treated as the Israelites were by Pharaoh, when he demanded bricks without furnishing the means to make them.</p><p>You are like a young, inexperienced lad, who is required to superintend all the complicated machinery of a manufactory, which he never was trained to understand, and on penalty of losing reputation, health, and all he values most.</p><p>Neither your parents, teachers, or husband have <emph rend="italic">trained</emph> you for the place you fill, nor furnished you with the knowledge or assistance needed to enable you to meet all the complicated and untried duties of your lot. A young woman who has never had the care of a child, never done housework, never learned the numberless processes that are indispensable to keep domestic affairs in regular order, never done anything but attend to books, drawing, and music, at school, and visiting and company after she left school, such an one is as unprepared to take charge of a nursery, kitchen, and family establishment, as she is to take charge of <emph rend="italic">a man-of-war.</emph> And the chief blame rests with those who placed her <emph rend="italic">so unprepared</emph> in such trying circumstances. Therefore, you have a right to feel that a large part of these evils are more your misfortune than your fault, and that they entitle you to sympathy rather than blame.</p><p>The next word of comfort is, the assurance that you <emph rend="italic">can</emph> do <emph rend="italic">every one</emph> of your duties, and do them well, and the following is the method by which you can do it. In the first place, make up your mind that it never is your <emph rend="italic">duty</emph> to do anything more than you <emph rend="italic">can</emph>, or in any better manner than <emph rend="italic">the best you can.</emph> And whenever you have done the best you can, you have done <emph rend="italic">well,</emph><pb n="279" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=304"/>and it is all that man <emph rend="italic">should</emph> require, and certainly all that your Heavenly Father <emph rend="italic">does</emph> require.</p><p>The next thing is, for you to make out an inventory of all the things that <emph rend="italic">need</emph> to be done, in your whole establishment. Then calculate what things you find you <emph rend="italic">cannot</emph> do, and strike them off the list, as what are not among your <emph rend="italic">duties.</emph> Of those that remain, select a certain number that you think you can do <emph rend="italic">exactly as they need to be done,</emph> and among these be sure that you put the making of <emph rend="italic">good bread.</emph> This every housekeeper <emph rend="italic">can</emph> do, if she will only determine to do it.</p><p>Make a selection of certain things that you will <emph rend="italic">persevere</emph> in having done <emph rend="italic">as well as they can be done,</emph> and let these be only so many as you feel sure you can succeed in attempting. Then make up your mind that all the rest must go along as they do, until you get more time, strength, and experience, to increase the list of things that you determine shall always be well done.</p><p>By this course, you will have the comfort of feeling that in <emph rend="italic">some</emph> respects you are as good a housekeeper as you can be, while there will be a cheering progress in gaining on all that portion of your affairs, that are left at loose ends. You will be able to measure a gradual advance, and be encouraged by success. Many housekeepers fail entirely, by expecting to do <emph rend="italic">everything well at first,</emph> when neither their knowledge or strength is adequate, and so they fail everywhere, and finally give up in despair.</p><p>Are you not only a housekeeper, but a <emph rend="italic">mother?</emph> Oh, sacred and beautiful name! how many cares and responsibilities are associated with it! And how many elevating and sublime anticipations and hopes are given to inspire, and to cheer! You are training young minds whose plastic texture will receive and retain every impression you make, who will imitate your feelings, tastes, habits, and opinions, and who will transmit what they receive from you to their children, to pass again to the next generation, and then to the next, until <emph rend="italic">a whole nation</emph> will have received its character and destiny from your hands! No imperial queen ever stood in a more<pb n="280" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=305"/>sublime and responsible position than you now occupy, in the eye of Him who reads the end from the beginning, and who is appointing all the trials and discipline of your lot, not for purposes which are visible to your limited ken, but in view of all the consequences that are to result from the character which you form, and are to transmit to your posterity!</p><p>Remember, then, that you have a Father in heaven, who sympathizes in all your cares, pities your griefs, makes allowances for your defects, and is endeavoring by trials, as well as by blessings, to fit you for the right fulfilment of your high and holy calling.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="servants"><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXXIII.</hd><hd align="center">FRIENDLY COUNSELS FOR DOMESTICS.</hd><p>MY friends, you fill a very important and respectable station. The duties committed to you by God are very apt to be considered of small account, but they are indeed most solemn and important.</p><p>On your faithfulness and kindness depends the comfort of a whole family, and on you often depends the character and happiness of a whole flock of children. If you do your part faithfully in assisting the mother to carry forward her plans, she will be able to train them aright. If you fail to perform your part, she will be perplexed, discouraged, and disabled, and everything will go wrong.</p><p>Every person finds troubles and trials in their lot, and so you must find them in yours. But trials are sent by God, not for evil, but for good, so that we, by patiently bearing them, and by striving to improve under them, may grow wiser and better, and thus more happy than we could be without them.</p><p>Whenever, therefore, anything vexes, or troubles you,<pb n="281" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=306"/>comfort yourselves by thinking that it is designed for your good, and reap at least one benefit, by bearing it with patience and cheerfulness.</p><p>In all your dealings with those who employ you, try to follow <emph rend="italic">"the golden rule,"</emph> and do by them as you will wish to have others do by you, when you are the mistress of a family, and hire others to help you.</p><p>Do you find that many things are uncomfortable and unpleasant in your present lot? Remember that you never can find a place in this world where everything will be just as you want it, and that it is a bad thing for you, as well as for your employers, to keep roving about from one place to another. Stay where you are, and try to make those things that trouble you more tolerable, by enduring them with patience. Do not fret and be angry at your employers when they oppose your wishes, but wait until you feel in better humor, and then tell them what troubles you, and what you wish they would alter, and in a kind and respectful way, and you will be ten times more likely to gain what you desire.</p><p>Do you think that you are found fault with too much, and that your employer is so hard to please that you wish to change for another? Perhaps you do not know how often you do things different from what she wishes, when she <emph rend="italic">does not</emph> complain. Perhaps she tells you only just what she thinks she ought to do, for your good. Perhaps she does not know that she <emph rend="italic">does</emph> find fault a great deal, or that her manner is an unpleasant one. Perhaps she has a great many cares and troubles that you know not of, which try her nerves, and make her feel very irritable, and thus speak hastily when she does not intend it.</p><p>Be patient with her failings, if you think you see any, just as you wish to have her bear with your faults, when they trouble her. If you find your patience failing, it may be well in some cases, to say to your employer, that you should do better, if she would find fault less, and praise you more when you do well. But never say anything<pb n="282" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=307"/>of this kind when you are angry yourself, or when you see that she is displeased.</p><p>Be careful, in all your dealings with children, always to <emph rend="italic">speak the truth,</emph> and never let them hear from you any filthy or wicked language. Never promise to do a thing and then break your word, for this teaches them to break promises. Never tell them frightful stories, or try to make them mind you by saying what is not true. Never help them conceal what they have done that is wrong, but try to persuade them to confess their faults.</p><p>Never take the least thing that does not belong to you, and never tempt children to give you what does not belong to them.</p><p>Never tell tales out of the family, nor tell to your employers the bad things you have seen, or heard in other families, for this is mean and ungenerous.</p><p>Do not spend your money for useless and expensive things, but learn to be economical and prudent, that you may be preparing to be a good housekeeper, wife, and mother, if ever you have a family of your own.</p><p>Do not form a habit of roaming about to see company, but be industrious in hours not employed for those who hire you, in mending and making your own clothes.</p><p>Take care and keep your person clean, and your hair and clothes in order, and have your chamber always neat and tidy.</p><p>Do not be rude and boisterous in manners, but always speak politely to all, especially to those who employ you.</p><p>Do not waste any of the provisions, or property of your employers, nor let it spoil by neglect, and never lend or give away anything belonging to the family without leave.</p><p>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.</p><p>Read your Bible daily, and try to obey its teachings.</p><p>Pray to God to forgive your past sins, and to help you keep all his commands, and live every day so that you will not be afraid to die.</p></chapter>

When thoroughly dry they are fit for use.</p><p>"An experienced hand will make 150 in an hour." Young boys can make them and sell to their companions.</p></formula></section></chapter>

<purpose align="center" rend="italic">Best Way of making Corn Cakes of all Sorts.</purpose>
There is often a sharp and strong taste to <ingredient>corn meal,</ingredient> which is remedied by wetting it up the day before it is used. The best kind of corn cakes are made by wetting up a large quantity of <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and letting it stand for several days. Take a quantity of it, and first make it as thin as you want, either for griddle cakes, or drop cakes, or thicker cakes. Add <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a spoonful of <ingredient>melted butter or lard</ingredient> for every quart, also <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to your taste. A little always improves all corn cakes. Then dissolve <ingredient>soda or saleratus,</ingredient> a teaspoonful for each quart. If it is very sour it will want more, and <emph rend="italic">tasting</emph> is the surest guide. Just as you are ready to bake, stir in enough saleratus to sweeten it, and stir quickly and only long enough to mix it well, and then <emph rend="italic">bake immediately</emph> in buttered tins.</p><p>Domestics often use too much saleratus, which is bad for the stomach, and the housekeeper should ascertain by trial the right quantity, and then direct to have it <emph rend="italic">carefully measured</emph> every time. Corn cakes, made as above, just thick enough to form into round cakes half an inch thick and baked on a griddle, are excellent.</p></recipe>

<div type="preface"><pb n="preface" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=334"/><hd align="center" size="larger">PREFACE</hd><hd align="center">TO THE THIRD EDITION.</hd><p>THE author of this work was led to attempt it, by discovering, in her extensive travels, the deplorable sufferings of multitudes of young wives and mothers, from the combined influence of <emph rend="italic">poor health, poor domestics, and a defective domestic education.</emph> The number of young women whose health is crushed, ere the first few years of married life are past, would seem incredible to one who has not investigated this subject, and it would be vain to attempt to depict the sorrow, discouragement, and distress experienced in most families where the wife and mother is a perpetual invalid.</p><p>The writer became early convinced that this evil results mainly from the fact, that young girls, especially in the more wealthy classes, <emph rend="italic">are not trained for their profession.</emph> In early life, they go through a course of school training which results in great debility of constitution, while, at the same time, their physical and domestic education is almost wholly neglected. Thus they enter on their most arduous and sacred duties so inexperienced and uninformed, and with so little muscular and nervous strength, that probably there is not <emph rend="italic">one chance in ten,</emph> that young women of the present day, will pass through the first years of married life without such prostration of health and spirits as makes life a burden to themselves, and, it is to be feared, such as seriously interrupts the confidence and happiness of married life.</p><p>The measure which, more than any other, would tend to remedy this evil, would be to place <emph rend="italic">domestic economy</emph> on an<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=335"/>equality with the other sciences in female schools. This should be done because it <emph rend="italic">can</emph> be properly and systematically taught (not <emph rend="italic">practically,</emph> but as a <emph rend="italic">science),</emph> as much so as <emph rend="italic">political economy</emph> or <emph rend="italic">moral science,</emph> or any other branch of study; because it embraces knowledge, which will be needed by young women at all times and in all places; because this science can never be <emph rend="italic">properly</emph> taught until it is made a branch of <emph rend="italic">study;</emph> and because this method will secure a dignity and importance in the estimation of young girls, which can never be accorded while they perceive their teachers and parents practically attaching more value to every other department of science than this. When young ladies are taught the construction of their own bodies, and all the causes in domestic life which tend to weaken the constitution; when they are taught rightly to appreciate and learn the most convenient and economical modes of performing all family duties, and of employing time and money; and when they perceive the true estimate accorded to these things by teachers and friends, the grand cause of this evil will be removed. Women will be trained to secure, as of first importance, a strong and healthy constitution, and all those rules of thrift and economy that will make domestic duty easy and pleasant.</p><p>To promote this object, the writer prepared this volume as a <emph rend="italic">text-book</emph> for female schools. It has been examined by the Massachusetts Board of Education, and been deemed worthy by them to be admitted as a part of the Massachusetts School Library.</p><p>It has also been adopted as a text-book in some of our largest and most popular female schools, both at the East and West.</p><p>The following, from the pen of Mr. George B. Emmerson, one of the most popular and successful teachers in our country, who has introduced this work as a text-book in<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=336"/>his own school, will exhibit the opinion of one who has formed his judgment from experience in the use of the work:</p><p>"It may be objected that such things cannot be taught by books. Why not? Why may not the structure of the human body, and the laws of health deduced therefrom, be as well taught as the laws of natural philosophy? Why are not the application of these laws to the management of infants and young children as important to a woman as the application of the rules of arithmetic to the extraction of the cube root? Why may not the properties of the atmosphere be explained, in reference to the proper ventilation of rooms, or exercise in the open air, as properly as to the burning of steel or sodium? Why is not the human skeleton as curious and interesting as the air-pump; and the action of the brain, as the action of a steam-engine? Why may not the healthiness of different kinds of food and drink, the proper modes of cooking, and the rules in reference to the modes and times of taking them, be discussed as properly as rules of grammar, or facts in history? Are not the principles that should regulate clothing, the rules of cleanliness, the advantages of early rising and domestic exercise, as readily communicated as the principles of mineralogy, or rules of syntax? Are not the rules of Jesus Christ, applied to refine <emph rend="italic">domestic manners</emph> and preserve a <emph rend="italic">good temper,</emph> as important as the abstract principles of ethics, as taught by Paley, Wayland, or Jouffroy? May not the advantages of neatness, system, and order, be as well illustrated in showing how they contribute to the happiness of a family, as by showing how they add beauty to a copy-book, or a portfolio of drawings? Would not a teacher be as well employed in teaching the rules of economy, in regard to time and expenses, or in regard to dispensing charity, as in teaching double, or single entry in book-keeping?<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=337"/>Are not the principles that should guide in constructing a house, and in warming and ventilating it properly, as important to young girls as the principles of the Athenian Commonwealth, or the rules of Roman tactics? Is it not as important that children should be taught the dangers to the mental faculties, when over-excited on the one hand, or left unoccupied on the other, as to teach them the conflicting theories of political economy, or the speculations of metaphysicians? For ourselves, we have always found children, especially girls, peculiarly ready to listen to what they saw would prepare them for future duties. The truth, that education should be <emph rend="italic">a preparation for actual, real life,</emph> has the greatest force with children. The constantly-recurring inquiry, 'What will be <emph rend="italic">the use</emph> of this study?' is always satisfied by showing, that it will prepare for any duty, relation, or office which, in the natural course of things, will be likely to come.</p><p>"We think this book extremely well suited to be used as a text-book in schools for young ladies, and many chapters are well adapted for a reading book for children of both sexes."</p><p>To this the writer would add the testimony of a lady who has used this work with several classes of young girls and young ladies. She remarked that she had never known a school-book that awakened more interest, and that some young girls would learn a lesson in this when they would study nothing else. She remarked, also, that when reciting the chapter on the construction of houses, they became greatly interested in inventing plans of their own, which gave an opportunity to the teacher to point out difficulties and defects. Had this part of domestic economy been taught in schools, our land would not be so defaced with awkward, misshapen, inconvenient, and, at the same time, needlessly expensive houses, as it now is.</p><pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=beec&#38;PageNum=338"/><p>Although the writer was trained to the care of children, and to perform all branches of domestic duty, by some of the best of housekeepers, much in these pages is offered, not as the result of her own experience, but as what has obtained the approbation of some of the most judicious mothers and housekeepers in the nation. The articles on Physiology and Hygiene, and those on horticulture, were derived from standard works on these subjects, and are sanctioned by the highest authorities.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Miss Beecher's Domestic Receipt Book</emph> is another work prepared by the author of the Domestic Economy, in connexion with several experienced housekeepers, and is designed for a supplement to this work. On pages 354, 355*, and 356* will be found the Preface and Analysis of that work, the two books being designed for a complete course of instructions on every department of Domestic Economy.</p><p>The copyright interest in these two works is held by a board of gentlemen appointed for the purpose, who, after paying a moderate compensation to the author for the time and labour spent in preparing these works, will employ all the remainder paid over by the publishers, to aid in educating and locating such female teachers as wish to be employed in those portions of our country, which are most destitute of schools.</p><p>The contract with the publisher provides that the publisher shall guaranty the sales and thus secure against any losses for bad debts, for which he shall receive five <emph rend="italic">per cent.</emph> He shall charge twenty per cent. for commissions paid to retailers, and also the expenses of printing, paper, and binding, at the current market prices, and make no other charges. The net profits thus determined are then to be divided equally, the publishers taking one half, and paying the other half to the board above mentioned</p></div>
