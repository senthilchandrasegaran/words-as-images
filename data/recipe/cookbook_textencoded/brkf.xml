<p>
I should be indeed flattered could I believe that you hail with as much pleasure as I do the renewal of the "Common-Sense Talks," to which I first invited you four years ago. For I have much to say to you in the same free-masonic, free-and-easy strain in which you indulged me then.
</p>
<p>
It is a wild March night. Winter and Summer, Spring-time and Autumn, the wind sings, or plains at my sitting-room window. Tonight its shout is less fierce than jocund to my ear, for it says, between the castanet passages of hail and sleet, that neither friend nor bore will interrupt our conference. Shutters and curtains are closed; the room is still, bright, and warm, and we are no longer strangers.
</p>
<p>
The poorest man of my acquaintance counts his money by the million, has a superb mansion he calls "home," a wife and beautiful children who call him "husband" and "father." He has friends by the score, and admirers by the hundred, for human nature has not abated one jot in prudential sycophancy since the Psalmist summed up a volume of satirical truth in the pretended "aside"--"and men will praise thee when thou doest well unto thyself." For all that, ho of whom I write is a pauper, inasmuch as he makes
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=14"/>
his boast that he never experienced the emotion of gratitude. He has worked his own way in the world, he is wont to say: has never had helping hand from mortal man or woman. It is a part of his religion to pay for all he gets, and never to ask a favor. Nevertheless, he confesses, with a complacent smirk that would he amusing were it not so pitiable an exhibition of his real beggary--"that he would like to know what it feels like to be grateful,--just for the sake of the novel sensation!"
</p>
<p>
Poor wretch! I am sorry I introduced him here and now. There is a savage growl in the wind; our snuggery is a trifle less pleasant since I began to talk of him. Although I only used him as a means of "leading up" to the expression of my own exceeding and abundant wealth of gratitude to you, dear Reader and Friend, If I had only time and strength enough to bear me through the full relation of the riches and happiness you have conferred upon me! There are letters in that desk over there between the windows that have caused me to look down with a sense of compassionate superiority upon Nathan Rothschild and the Duke of Brunswick. I am too modest (or miserly) to show them; but now and then, when threatened with a fit of self-depreciation, I come in here, lock the door, stop the keyhole, get them out and read them anew. For three days thereafter I walk on air. For the refrain of all is the same. "You have been a help to me!" And only He who knows the depths, sad and silent, or rich and glad, of the human heart can understand how much I wanted to help you. Verily, I have in this matter had my reward. Again, I say, I
<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=15"/>
am grateful. Had I "helped" you a hundred times as well as I have, I should still be your debtor.
</p>
<p>
May I read you somewhat copious extracts from a letter I received, the other day, from a wide-awake New England girl? Not only wide-awake, but refined, original and sprightly; a girl whom though I have never seen her face, I know to be a worker in life as well as a thinker. She says some things much better than I could have put them, and others as noteworthy, which I wish to answer,--or, try to answer-- since I recognize in her a representative of a class, not very large, perhaps, but certainly one of the most respectable and honored of all those for whom I write, the "Common-Sense Series." I should like to give the letter in full, from the graphic touches with which she sketches herself, "sitting upon the kitchen-table, reading 'Common Sense in the Household," one bright morning, when herself and sisters had taken possession of the kitchen to make preparation for "an old New England tea-party," at which their only assistant was to be "a small maiden we keep to have the privilege of waiting upon, and doing our own work into the bargain ; who, in waiting at table, was never known to pass anything on the right side, and has an invincible objection to learning how"--to the conclusion, over against which she has, like the frank woman she is, set her name and address in full.
</p>
<p>
But the modesty (or miserliness) aforesaid rises in sudden arms to forbid the reproduction at my hand of certain portions of the epistle, and it would be neither kind nor honorable to set down in prospective print her pictures of home life and 
<emph rend="italic">dramatis person&#230;.</emph>
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=16"/>
Steering clear, when possible, of these visible rocks and sunken reefs, I will indulge you and myself with a part of that which has added sensibly to my treasures--not debt--mind you! of gratitude.
</p>
<p>
"I want to tell you how much your compilation does for those poor mortals whom it rescues from the usual class of cook-books."
</p>
<p>
A reef, you see, before we are out of harbor! "We will skip two pages to get at one of the well-said things I spoke of just now.
</p>
<p>
"You speak of 'company china' and 'company manners.' I detest company 
<emph rend="italic">anything</emph>! This longing for show and display is the curse and failing of Americans. I abhor the phrase 'Anything will do for us.' I do not believe that a person can be true clear through and without affectations who can put on her politeness with her company china any more than a real lady can deliberately put on stockings with holes in them. I seriously think that, so far from its being self-sacrifice to put up with the meanest every day, and hospitality to use the best for company, it is a positive damage to one's sense of moral fitness. I knew a woman once who used to surprise me with the deceptions in which she unconsciously and needlessly indulged. This ceased to he a surprise when I saw her wear a twenty-dollar hat and a pair of unmended hose, and not seem to know that it was not quite the proper thing."
</p>
<p>
Orthodox, you perceive, thus far, is our New England correspondent. Honest and outspoken in her hatred of shams and "dodges" of all kinds; quick to see analogies and deduce conclusions. Now comes the pith of the communication:--
</p>
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=17"/>
<p>
"I wish you could set me right on one point that often perplexes me. 
<emph rend="italic">Is housekeeping worth while?</emph> I do not despise the necessary work. On the contrary, I hold that anything well done is worth doing. But with the materials this country affords, 
<emph rend="italic">can</emph> housekeeping be well done? Is it worth while for a woman to neglect the talents she has, and can use to her own and her friends' advantage, in order to have a perfectly appointed house to wear herself out chasing around after servants and children that things may be always done well, and at the stated time? I have seen so many women of brains wear out and die in harness, trying to do their self-imposed duty; to see that the large establishments their husbands' wealth, position and wishes place in their care shall be perfect in detail. And these women could have been so happy and enjoyed the life they threw away, if they had only known how 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> to keep house. While, on the other hand, with a small income and one servant the matter is so much worse. I should not mind if one could ever say "It is a well-finished thing!" But you only finish one thing to begin over again, and so on, until you die and have nothing to show for your life's work. It looks hopeless to me, I confess. I wish you would show me the wisdom--or the folly of it all."
</p>
<p>
Now, I do not propose to show the folly of anything such as a girl that writes. She is a sincere inquirer after truth. When her letter came I tucked it under my inkstand, and said, "There is a text ready-written, and in clerkly hand, for my next 'Familiar Talk!'" She is altogether too sensible and has too true a sense of humor to be offended when I tell her, as I
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=18"/>
shall, that her lament over unfinished work reminded me comically of the story of the poor follow who cat his throat, because, as he stated in his letter of explanation and farewell--"He was tired of buttoning and unbuttoning!" There is a deal that is specious in the threadbare adage set forth in dolesome rhyme:--
</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">
"Man's work is from sun to sun<lb/> But woman's work is never done."
</p>
<p>
Nothing in this world, or in all time, is finished. Or, if finished, it is 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> well with it. We hear this truth reiterated in every stroke of the artisan's hammer, employed--from the day he enters upon his apprenticeship to that on which the withered hand can no longer, by reason of age, lift the ponderous emblem of his craft--in beating upon what looks to the observer of to-day like that which engaged him yesterday; which to the spectator of twenty to-morrows will seem the same as that which calls out the full strength of the brawny arm this hour. When he dies, who will care to chronicle the circumstance that he made, in the course of a long and busy life, forty thousand horse-shoes, or assisted in the manufacture of one thousand engine-boilers? We learn the same lesson from the patient eyes of the teacher while drilling one generation after another in the details that are the tedious forging of the wards of the key of knowledge;--the rudiments of "the three R's," which, laugh or groan as we may, must be committed to memories more or less reluctant. They were never, I am sure, "learned by heart." It is well, so far as they are concerned, that the old phrase has gone out of fashion. We read the like tale of ever-renewed endeavor in the bent
<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=19"/>
brows find whitening locks of brain-toilers, the world over. Nature were a false teacher were this otherwise. Birth, maturity, death; first, the blade then the ear, and, after the full corn in the ear, ripening and destruction for the good of man or beast, or decay in the earth that resurrection may come to the buried seed. Seed-time and harvest, summer and winter,--none of these are "finished things." God hold our eyes from seeing many things that are!
</p>
<p>
A life, the major part of which is spent in sweeping, that the dust may re-settle; in washing, that clothes may he again worn and soiled; in cooking, that the food prepared may be consumed; in cleansing plates and dishes, to put back upon the table that they may return, in grease and stickiness, to the hardly-dried pan and towel, does seem to the superficial spectator, ignoble even for the wife of a struggling mechanic or ill-paid clerk. But 1 insist that the fault is not that Providence has made her a woman, but that Providence has made and kept her poor. Her husband at his bench, or, rounding his shoulders over his ledger, has as valid cause of complaint of never done work. Is there any reason why he should stand more patiently in his lot, waiting to see what GOD the LORD will do, than she?
</p>
<p>
But--"Is it worth while for a woman to neglect the talents she has, and can. use to her own and her friends' advantage, in order to have a perfectly-appointed house, etc?"
</p>
<p>
Certain visions that stir me to reverential admiration, arise before me, at that query. I see Emily Bront&#233; reading German while she kneads the batch of homemade
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=20"/>
bread; Charlotte, laying down the pen upon an unfinished page of Shirley, to steal into the kitchen when poor blind Tabby's back is turned, and bear off the potatoes the superannuated servant insists upon peeling every day, that the "dainty fingers" may extract the black "eyes" the faithful old creature cannot see. I see the Greek grammar fixed open in the rack above Elihu Burritt's forge; and Sherman, reciting to himself by day over his lapstone and last, the lessons he learned at night after work-hours were over. I recollect that the biographer of the "marvellous boy" has written of him--" Twelve hours he was chained to the office; 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> from eight in the morning until eight at night, the dinner-hour only excepted; and in the house he was confined to the kitchen; slept with the foot-boy, and was subjected to indignities of a like nature. Yet here it was, during this life of base humiliation, that Thomas Chatterton worked out the splendid creations of his imagination. In less than three years of the life of a poor attorney's apprentice, fed in the kitchen and lodged with the foot-boy, did he here achieve an immortality such as the whole life of not one in millions is sufficient to create."
</p>
<p>
Note here, too, that Chatterton died of a broken heart; was not driven to suicide by hard work.
</p>
<p>
Please be patient with me while I tell you of an incident that seems to me pretty, and comes in patly just at this point.
</p>
<p>
I have a friend--my heart bounds with prideful pleasure while I call her such!--who is the most scholarly woman, and also the best housekeeper I know. She is, moreover, one of the sweetest of our
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=21"/>
native poets--one to whose genius and true womanhood even royalty has done grateful honor; a woman who 'has used her' every 'talent to her own and her friends' advantage' in more ways than one. She had a call one day from a neighbor, an eminent professor, learned in dead and spoken tongues. In the passage of the conversation from trifles to weightier matters, it chanced that she differed in opinion from him upon two points. He refused to believe that potatoes could ever be made into a palatable sweet by any ingenuity of the culinary art, and he took exception to her rendering of a certain passage of Virgil. In the course of the afternoon he received from hie fair neighbor a folded paper and a covered dish. Opening the former, he read a metrical translation of the disputed passage, so beautiful and striking he could no longer doubt that she had discovered the poet's meaning more truly than had he. The dish contained a delicious potato custard, A foolscap page of rhymed thanks went back with the empty pudding-dish. It was mere doggerel, for the pundit was no poet, and meant his note for nothing more than jingle and fun, but his tribute of admiration was sincere. I forget the form of its expression, except that the concluding lines ran somewhat thus:--
</p>
<p>
"From Virgil and potatoes, too,<lb/>You bring forth treasures rich and new."
</p>
<p>
Am I harsh and unsympathetic when I say, that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, if a woman has genuine talent, she will find time to improve it even amid the clatter of household machinery? I could multiply instances by the thousand to prove this, did time permit.
</p>
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=22"/>
<p>
But what of the poor rich woman who throws away her life in the vain endeavor to bring servants and children "up to time?" Two things. First, she dies of worry, not of work--a distinction with a difference.
</p>
<p>
Second, if she possess one-half enough strength of mind and strength of purpose to have made herself mistress of a single art or science, or sufficient tact to sustain her as a successful leader in society, or the degree of administrative ability requisite to enable her to conduct rightly a public enterprise of any note, be it benevolent, literary, or social, she ought to be competent to the government of her household; to administer domestic affairs with such wise energy as should insure order and punctuality without self-immolation.
</p>
<p>
"If they have run with the footmen and they have wearied them, how shall they contend with horses!"
</p>
<p>
Let us look at this matter fairly, and without prejudice on either side. I should contradict other of my written and spoken opinions; stultify myself beyond the recovery of your respect or my own, were I to deny that more and wider avenues of occupation should be opened to woman than are now conceded as their right by the popular verdict. But 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> because the duties of the housewife are overburdensome or degrading. On the contrary, I would have forty trained cooks where there is now one; would make her who looketh diligently to the ways of her household worthy, as in Solomon's day, of double honor. Of co-operative laundries I have much hope. I would have washing-day become a tradition of the past to be shuddered over by every emancipated family in the land. In "co-operative housekeeping," in the sense in which it is generally
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=23"/>
understood, I have scanty faith as a cure for the general untowardness of what my sprightly correspondent styles "the materials this country affords." Somebody must get the dinners and somebody superintend the getting-up of these. I honestly believe that the best method of reforming American domestic service and American cookery is by making the mistress of every home proficient in the art and a capable instructress of others. I know--no one better--how women who have never cared to beautify their own tables, or to study elegant variety in their bills of fare, who have railed at soups as "slops," and 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es</emph> as "trash," talk, after the year's travel in foreign lands their husband's earnings and their own pinching have gained for them. How they groan over native cookery and the bondage of native mistresses, and tell how cheaply and luxuriously one can live in 
<emph rend="italic">dear</emph> Paris.
</p>
<p>
"Will the time ever come," they cry, "when we, too, can sit at ease in our frescoed saloons surrounded by no end of artificial flowers and mirrors, and order our meals from a restaurant?"
</p>
<p>
To which I, from the depths of my home-loving heart, reply, "Heaven forbid!"
</p>
<p>
Have you ever thought how large a share the kitchen and dining-room have in forming the distinctive characteristics of the home? It is no marvel that the man who has had his dinners from an eating-house all his life should lack a word to describe that which symbolizes to the Anglo-Saxon all that is dearest and most sacred on earth. I avow, without a tinge of shame, that I soon tire, then sicken of restaurant and hotel dainties. I like the genuine wholesomeness of home-fare.
</p>
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=24"/>
<p>
"Madame," said a Frenchman whom I once met at an American watering-place, "one of my compatriots could produce one grand repast--one that should not want for the beautiful effects, with the contents of that pail--tub--bucket--of what the peoples here call the 
<emph rend="italic">svill,</emph>" pointing to a mass of dinner 
<emph rend="italic">d&#233;bris</emph> set just without a side door.
</p>
<p>
"Monsieur," I rejoined, with a grimace that matched his, 
<emph rend="italic">"moi, je n'aime pas le svill!"</emph>
</p>
<p>
He was right, without doubt, in the implication that very much is thrown away as refuse which could be reproduced upon the table to the satisfaction and advantage of best and guest. Perhaps my imagination was more to blame than he for my unlucky recollection of his country woman's recommendation of a mayonnaise to a doubting guest;
</p>
<p>
"You need not fear to partake, madame. The fish has been preserved from putrefaction by a process of vinegar and charcoal!"
</p>
<p>
It is a substantial comfort to the Anglo-Saxon stomach for its owner to know what he is eating. Call it prejudice, if you like, but it may have something to do with making one "true clear through," as my Yankee girl puts it.
</p>
<p>
"But such poetic repasts!" sighs my travelled acquaintance. "Such heavenly garnishes, and flowers everywhere, and the loveliest side-dishes, and everything so exquisitely served! When I think of them, I abominate our great, vulgar joints and stiff dinner-tables!"
</p>
<p>
Yet Mrs. Nouveau Riche dawdles all the forenoon over a piece of tasteless embroidery, and gives the afternoon to gossip; while Bridget or Dinah prepares
<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=25"/>
dinner, and serves it in accordance with her peculiar ideas of right and fitness.
</p>
<p>
"Train American servants?" she says, in a transport of contemptuous incredulity at my suggestion that here is good missionary ground, "I have had enough of that! Just as soon as I teach them the rudiments of decent cookery they carry off their knowledge to somebody else, trade for double wages from my neighbor upon what they have gained from me!"
</p>
<p>
"But," I remark, argumentatively, "do you not see, my dear lady, that so surely as 'ten times one is ten,' if all your neighbors were, in like manner, to instruct the servants who come to 
<emph rend="italic">them</emph> and desert, so soon as they are taught their trade, the great work of securing wholesome and palatable cookery and tasteful serving would soon be an accomplished fact in your community? and, by the natural spread of the leaven, the race of incompetent cooks and clumsy waiters would before long become extinct? Would it not be worth while for housekeepers to co-operate in the attempt to secure excellence in these departments instead of 'getting along somehow' with 'the materials'--<emph rend="italic">i. e.</emph>, servants--'this country affords?' Why not compel the country--wrong-headed abstraction that it is!--to afford us what we want? Would not the demand, thus enforced and persisted in, create a supply?"
</p>
<p>
"Not in my day," she retorts, illogically. "I don't care to wear myself out for the benefit of posterity."
</p>
<p>
I do not gainsay the latter remark. If she had any desire that the days to come should be better than these, she would see to it that her daughters are rendered comparatively independent of the ungrateful caprices
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=26"/>
of the coming Celt or Teuton or the ambitions vagaries of "the Nation's Ward," by a practical knowledge of housewifery. Perhaps she is deterred from undertaking their instruction by the forecast shadow of their desertion of the maternal abode for homes of their own.

The prettiest thing that has ever been said of the informal "talks" I had with you, my Reader, in former days, was the too-flattering remark of a Syracuse (N.Y.) editor, that they were "like a breath of fresh air blowing across the 'heated term' of the cook."
</p>
<p>
I quote it, partly that I may thank the author, principally that I may borrow the illustration. The heavenly airs that really temper the torrid heats of the kitchen are loving thoughts of those for whom the house-mother makes the home. There is a wealth of meaning in the homely old saying about "putting one's name in the pot." It is one thing, I submit to the advocates of co-operative housekeeping, whether big John's and little John's and Mamie's and Susie's and Tommy's meals arc prepared according to the prescriptions of a salaried 
<emph rend="italic">chef</emph>, in the mammoth boilers, steamers and bakers of an "establishment" along with the sustenance of fifty other families, or whether the tender mother, in her "order of the day," remembers that while Papa likes smart, tingling dashes of cayenne, garlic, and curry, the baby-tongues of her brood would cry out at the same; that Mamie has an aversion to a dish much liked by her brothers and sisters; that Susie is delicate, and cannot digest the strong meat that is the gift of flesh and brains to the rest. So Papa gets his spiced ragout under a tiny cover--hot-and-hot--and
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=27"/>
the plainer "stew," which was its base, nourishes the bairns. Mamie is not forced to fast while the rest feast, and by pale Susie's plate is set the savory "surprise," which is the visible expression of loving kindness, always wise and unforgetting.
</p>
<p>
You remember the legend that tells how Elizabeth of Hungary, having been forbidden by her lord to carry food to the poor, was met one day by him outside the castle walls, as she was bearing a lapful of meat and bread to her pensioners. Louis demanding sternly what she carried in her robe, she was obliged to show him the forbidden burden. "Whereupon," says the chronicler, "the food was miraculously changed, for his eyes, to a lapful of roses, red-and-white, and, his mind disabused of suspicion, he graciously bade her pass on whithersoever she would."
</p>
<p>
I have bethought me many times of the legend when I have seen upon very modest tables such proofs of thoughtful recollection of the peculiar tastes and needs of the flock to which the home caterer ministered as made my heart warm and eyes fill, and threw, to my imagination, chaplets lovelier than Elizabeth's roses around the platter and bowl. This is the true poetry of serving, and the loving appreciation of it is the reward, rich and all-sufficient, of thought, care, and toil.

A few words more before we proceed, in due order, to business. This volume is not an amendment to "General Receipts, No. 1 of the Common-Sense Series." Still less is it intended as a substitute for it. I have carefully avoided the repetition, in this volume, of a single receipt which appeared in that. This is designed to be the second story in the edifice of domestic economy, the
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=28"/>
materials of which I have accumulated since the first was completed. As money makes money, and a snow-ball gathers snow, so receipts, new, valuable, and curious, flowed in upon me after "No. 1" was given to the world. Some of the earliest to reach me were so good that I began a fresh compilation by the time that book was fairly off the press.
</p>
<p>
Let me say here what you may find useful in your own researches and collections. My best ally in the classification and preservation of the materials for this undertaking has been the "The Household Treasury," published by Claxton, Remsen &#38; Haffelfinger, Philadelphia, and arranged by a lady of that city. It is a pretty volume of blank pages, a certain number of which are devoted to each department of cookery, beginning with soups, and running through the various kinds of sweets, pickles, etc. Each is introduced by a handsome vignette and appropriate motto, with a title at the top of every page. The paper is excellent and distinctly ruled, I wish I could put a copy into the hands of every housekeeper who believes in system of details, and development of her individual capabilities. It has so far simplified and lightened the task of preparing "Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea" for my public, that I cannot withhold this recommendation of it to others.
</p>
<p>
Yet if "General Receipts " was written 
<emph rend="italic">con amore</emph>, its successor has been, in a still higher degree, a work of love and delight. There were times during the preparation of the trial volume when I could not feel quite sure of my audience. There has not been a moment, since I began that which I now offer for your acceptance, in the
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=29"/>
which I have not been conscious of your full sympathy; have not tasted, in anticipation, your enjoyment of that which I have taken such pleasure in making ready.
</p>
<p>
Do not think me sentimental when I ask that the Maltese cross, marking, as in the former work, such receipts as I have tested and proved for myself to be reliable, may be to you, dear friend and sister, like the footprint of a fellow-traveler along the humble but honorable pathway of every-day and practical life, bringing comfort and encouragement, even in the "heated term."

"Give me half-a-dozen eggs, a few spoonfuls of gravy and as much cream, with a spoonful of butter and a handful of bread crumbs, and I can get up a good breakfast or luncheon," said a housekeeper to me once, in a modest boastfulness that became her well, in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
For I had sat often at her elegant, but frugal board, and I knew she spoke the truth.
</p>
<p>
"Elegant and frugal!" I shall have more hope of American housewives when they learn to have faith in this combination of adjectives. Nothing has moved me more strongly to the preparation of this work than the desire to convert them to the belief that the two are not incompatible or inharmonious. Under no head can practice in the endeavor to conform these, the one to the other, be more easily and successfully pursued than under that which begins this section.
</p>
<p>
Eggs at sixty cents per dozen (and they are seldom higher than this price) are the cheapest food for the breakfast or lunch-table of a private family. They are nutritious, popular, and never (if we except the cases of omelettes, thickened with uncooked flour, and fried eggs, drenched with fat) an unelegant or homely dish.

He was a shrewd C&#x153;lebs who restrained his lovely impatience to throw himself, in unconditional surrender, at the feet of his beloved, by the resolution to see her first at the breakfast-table. It is to be regretted that his admiring biographer has not recorded the result of the experiment. Let us hope, for the sake of preserving the "unities of the drama" that Cecilia was "in good form" on the momentous occasion; not a thread ironed awry in bib or tucker; not a rebellious hair in her sleek locks. C&#x153;lebs--Hannah More's C&#x153;lebs--and every other that I ever read or heard of, was a pragmatical prig; the complacent proprietor of a patent refrigerator, very commodious and in excellent repair, but which ought never, even by his conceited self, to have been mistaken for a heart.

<p>
Knowing you, my reader, as I do, I would not insult your good sense by intimating that the husband of your choice resembles him in any leading trait. Being a sensible (and avowedly a fallible) man, therefore, John does not expect you to appear at the breakfast-table in the flowing robes and elaborate laces that belong to the leisure hours of the day. If he does, he should don dress-coat and white cravat to keep you in countenance. He will not find fault with a neat
<pb n="62" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=74"/>
<emph rend="italic">peignoir</emph> (if it 
<emph rend="italic">be</emph> neat), or a plainly-trimmed dress, or a white apron before the same. He ought to look for, and to see a clean collar put on straight and fastened snugly at the throat, or a white ruffle and cuffs, or wrist-ruffles, to correspond, and hair in irreproachable order. I have seen women who called themselves ladies, who could never find time to give their hair what they called "a good combing," until afternoon. And time and patience would fail me, and I fear the equanimity of your diaphragm as well, were I to attempt even a partial recapitulation of the many and disgustful varieties of morning toilettes, of which I have been the unwilling spectator. You should hear my John,--whose profession takes him into what the renowned Ann Gale styles the "buzzom of families," at all sorts of unconventional hours,--dilate upon this theme. Not invalid attire. "When the work of wearing the robe of flesh becomes a matter of pain and difficulty, he must be indeed hypercritical who notes the ill-fitting wrapper, or roughened hair.
</p>
<p>
"But the queens of the breakfast-table!" he says, with lifted eyebrows. "The grimy chrysalids of the afternoon butterflies! It is not a casual glimpse of Cinderella on sweeping-day, or during house-cleaning week, that I complain of; but my heart swells with sincerest pity for the husbands before whose eyes the play is enacted three hundred and sixty-five times every year; to whom the elf-locks and collarless neck, the greasy, lank, torn dressing-gown of dark calico appear as surely and regularly as the light of each new day."
</p>
<p>
I do not say that you should bring to the breakfast-table a face like a May morning. I hate stereotyped
<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=75"/>
phrases and stereotyped smiles. But try to look as gracious as though a visitor sat between you and the gentleman at the foot of the board. It is not always easy to appear even moderately cheerful at breakfast-time. An eminent physician told me once, as the result of many years' study and observation, that no woman should be up in the morning more than an hour before breaking her fast. My own experience has so far corroborated the wisdom of the advice that I always strive to impress upon my domestics, especially the not strong ones, the expediency of eating a slice of bread and drinking a cup of tea during the interval that must elapse between their rising-hour and the kitchen breakfast I practise the like precaution against faintness and headache, in my own case, when I have to give my personal superintendence to the morning meal, or when it is later than usual. But with all precautionary measures, I believe "before breakfast" to be the most doleful hour of the twenty-four to a majority of our sex. In winter, the house is at a low temperature; dressing, a hurried and disagreeable business; the children are drowsy, lazy, and cross; John "doesn't want to seem impatient, but would like to have breakfast on time, to-day, my dear, as I have an important engagement." While the mother, who has slept with one ear quite open all night, and one eye half shut, because she fancied, at bed-time, that baby's breathing was not quite natural, fights twenty battles with bodily discomfort and spiritual irritability before she takes her seat behind the coffee-urn, and draws her first long breath at the beginning of the "blessing," that reminds her of the mercies, new every morning, which
<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=76"/>
are still hers. For all this, try womanfully to launch John upon the day's voyage with a smile and word of cheer. Think twice before you tell him of the cook's indolence and stupidity, and the housemaid's petulance. In the hope that the nauseating pain in your head may yield to a "good cup of tea--(bless it, with me, O my sisters, one and all!) it is as well to withhold the fact of its existence from him. If he 
<emph rend="italic">will</emph> read the morning paper over his coffee, his cakes growing cold meanwhile, and thereby obliges the cook to bake twice as many as would be necessary for the meal were all to partake of it at the same time, restrain the censure that trembles on your tongue, and chat merrily with the children. A silent, hasty breakfast is one of the worst things imaginable for their digestion and tempers.
</p>
<p>
You would often rather have "a comfortable cry" in a corner than act thus, but persuade yourself bravely that nine-tenths of your miserable sensations are hysterical, and, therefore, ephemeral. If we women do not know what the "morning cloud " is, nobody does. Still, remember it "passeth away."
</p>
<p>
If possible, let your eating-room be light and pleasant,--warm in winter, breezy in summer. Not only should the table be neat,> orderly, and, so far as you can make it so, pretty, but guard against what I have mentally characterized, in some very grand 
<emph rend="italic">salles-&#224;;-manger,</emph> as the " workshop look"--the look that says to all who enter--"This is the place where you must eat." There are tall beaufets with loads of plate and glass, side-tables with reserves of implements for the labors of the hour and place; pictures of game, fish
<pb n="65" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=77"/>
and fruit;--more eating;--and if the walls are frescoed, more game, sheep and oxen, or, at the beet, hunting, seem to reassure the consumers of today that there will be more creatures killed in season for to-morrow's dinner. Therefore, eat, drink and be solemn while doing it, as befits the season and surroundings. There is nothing like having a single eye to business.
</p>
<p>
Do not fret yourself if your dining-room boasts neither paintings nor frescoes. Throw open all the shutters in the morning, and coax in every available ray of sunlight. Press the weather into service to adorn the repast. If fine, remark upon the blueness of the sky and the enjoyment of the outer world in the glory of the clay. If stormy, make the best of home-cheer, and promise something attractive as an evening entertainment, should the weather continue wet, or snowy. A canary-bird in the sunniest window is a good thing to have in a breakfast-room if you like his shrill warbling. A pot of English ivy, brave and green, twisting over the face of the old clock, and festooning the windows, is a choice bit of brightness in the winter time. In summer, when flowers are cheap and plentiful, never set the table without them if you can got nothing more than a button-hole bouquet to lay on John's napkin. Insist that the children shall make themselves tidy before coming to the table, whatever may be the meal, even if they will meet nobody except yourself there. Teach them early that it is a disgrace to themselves and to you to eat with unclean hands and faces. Inculcate, further, the propriety of introducing, while at table, topics that will interest and please all
<pb n="66" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=78"/>
Let wrangling, fault-finding and recrimination be never so much as named among them. These are little things, but whatever detracts from the idea that the family repast is a tri-daily festival, and should be honored and enjoyed as such, is a wrong to those whose happiness it is your mission to guard and maintain. A wrong to health as to heart. Food swallowed in bitterness of spirit engenders dyspepsia and bile as surely as do acrid fruit and heavy bread. A sharp reprimand will take away sensitive Mamie's appetite, and a frown between the eyes that, when serene, seem to John to mirror heaven itself, will beget in his bosom that indescribable sinking of heart we know as "goneness," which is yet not physical faintness.
</p>
<p>
I have jotted down these hints under the heading of "Breakfast," although most of them are applicable to all meals, because, as a rule, people bring less keenness of hunger to this than to any other. It is as if the longest fast that separates our stated time of eating from another were the hardest to break; as if we had got out of the habit of desiring and receiving food. It behooves us, then, as wise housewives, to make provision against mortifying rejection of our viands by various and artful devices to tempt the dull or coy appetite. Especially should we study to avoid sameness in our breakfast bills of fare; an easy thing to compass by a moderate exercise of foresight and ingenuity on the part of the housewife.
</p>
<p>
The American breakfast should be a pleasing medium between the heavy cold beef and game pie of the English and the--for our climate and "fast" habits of life--too light morning refreshment of the French.
<pb n="67" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=79"/>
That in order to accomplish these ends it is not necessary greatly to increase the market bills of the house-hold, or the cares of the mistress, I have tried to prove in these pages, while I have not deemed it well to specify, in all cases, which are exclusively breakfast dishes. Very many of those I have described might appear with equal propriety at breakfast, at luncheon, at what is spoken of in provincial circles as "a hearty supper," or as an

<chapter class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="right" rend="bold" placement="heading">CROQUETTES.</hd>
<p>
These popular little 
<emph rend="italic">roulettes,</emph> although comparatively new to the tables of most private families in America, hold their place well where they have been once introduced. Like the 
<emph rend="italic">pat&#233;,</emph> their name is Legion as regards shape, nature and quality.
</p>
<p>
In a housewifely conversation with a lady a few months since, the word "croquette" chanced to escape me, and I was caught up eagerly.
</p>
<p>
"Now," with an ingenuous blush, "do you know, I was offered some at a dinner-party the other day, and was completely nonplussed! I thought croquet was a game."
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">"Croquette!"</emph> I interposed, making the most of the final 
<emph rend="italic">t</emph>, and 
<emph rend="italic">e.</emph>
</p>
<p>
"The gentleman who sat next me said 
<emph rend="italic">'croquay,'</emph> very plainly, I assure you. But never mind the name. What are they made of? Hominy?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," returned I. "Or rice, or potato, or lobster, crab, salmon, halibut, cod, chicken, turkey, duck, game, veal, lamb, or beef. In short, of all kinds of fish, flesh, fowl, and vegetable. The smaller varieties are familiarly known to readers of cookery-books as "olives" of meat, poultry, or game; the larger as 
<emph rend="italic">rissoles</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">croquettes,</emph> the largest as 
<emph rend="italic">cannelons</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">mirotons."</emph>
</p>
<pb n="76" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=88"/>
<p>
"Good gracious!" uttered my overwhelmed friend. "Before I would bother my brain with such puzzling nonsense, I would set my family down to cold meat three times a day three days in a week!"
</p>
<p>
I believed she meant what she said. But not the less is it a "good" and a "gracious" thing for the housewife to conjure out of such unconsidered and unsightly trifles as the mutilated cold fowl from which half the breast and both legs are missing, or the few chops "left over," or "that bone" of lamb or veal, or three square inches of cold fish, a pretty 
<emph rend="italic">plat</emph> for breakfast or luncheon, of golden-brown croquettes, imbedded in parsley, or in a ruby setting of pickled beets, that shall quicken John's flagging appetite, and call from the little ones the never stale plaudit, "Mamma can always get up something nice."
</p>
<p>
"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost," is a text from which the thoughtful house mother may preach to herself, as well as to her servants. That no opportunity of making home fairer, and even one hour of the day a little brighter, be lost or overlooked. That no possibility of proving her constant, active love for the least of her flock be passed by. These daily cares and hourly assiduities are the rivets in the chain that binds her best beloved ones unto THE FAMILY. Lacking them, the relation, instituted by law and continued by custom, has no stancher securities than habit and convenience--a hay-rope that will shrivel at the first touch of Passion, be rent by one resolute wrench of Expediency.
</p>
<p>
"A serious view to take of croquettes?" do I hear you say. Then hearken to something positive and practical.
</p>
<pb n="77" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=89"/>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Unpalatable food is not wholesome.</emph> It may be medicinal. Nothing forced upon an unwilling appetite, and that does not gratify the palate, can impart that freshness of animal spirit and vigor which we call Life--spontaneous vitality. Indifferent fuel--green or sodden wood, or slaty coal--may keep a fire from going out. There is not begotten from these the leaping flame that gladdens, while it warms. And cold meat and bread, dried into sawdusty innutrition, should no more form the staple of John's meals, even three times a week, than his grate be filled, on December nights, with coke-dust and mica.

It is usually necessary to bespeak sweetbreads several days in advance, as they are both scarce and popular. But if your butcher be accommodating, and yourself a valued customer, there is seldom much difficulty in procuring enough to make a dish for a family of ordinary size.
</p>
<p>
Keep sweetbreads in a cold, dry place, and cook as soon as possible after getting them, as they soon spoil. Be careful, moreover, in cooking them, to see that they are thoroughly done.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">HASTE OR WASTE?</hd>
<p>
"AH! you forget my sedan-chair," said Madame de Sta&#235;l, when, at the height of her social and literary fame some one wondered how she found time for writing amid her many and engrossing engagements.
</p>
<p>
The sedan-chair was the fashionable conveyance for ladies, at that day, in their round of daily calls or evening festivities, and the brilliant Frenchwoman secured within its closed curtains the solitude and silence she needed for composition.
</p>
<p>
An American authoress who wrote much and with great care--never sending her brain-bantlings into the world 
<emph rend="italic">en d&#233;shabille</emph>--replied to a similar question: "My happiest thoughts come to me while I am mixing cake. My most serious study-hours are those devoted apparently to darning the family stockings."
</p>
<p>
I entered a street-car, not many days ago, and sat down beside a gentleman who did not lift his eyes from a book he was reading, or show, by any token, his consciousness of others' presence. A side-glance at the volume told me it was Froude's "History of England," and I cheerfully forgave his inattention to myself. The conductor notified him when he reached his stopping-place, and, with a readiness that betrayed admirable mental training, he came out of the world through which the fascinating historian was leading him, pocketed
<pb n="99" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=111"/>
his book, recognized me with a pleasant word, and stepped to the pavement in front of his store, the thorough business man.
</p>
<p>
"That is an affected prig," said a fellow-passenger, by the time the other had left the car. "He and I take this ride in company every morning and afternoon. It takes him half an hour to go from his house to his store; and, instead of amusing himself with his newspaper, as the rest of us do, he always has some heavy-looking book along--biography, or history, or a scientific treatise. He begins to read by the time he is seated, and never leaves off until he gets out. It is in wretched taste, such a show of pedantic industry."
</p>
<p>
After this growl of disapprobation, the speaker buried himself anew in the advertising columns of the 
<emph rend="italic">Herald,</emph> and I lapsed into a brown study, which had for its germ the query, "Is it, then, more respectable, even among men, to kill time than to save it?"
</p>
<p>
I knew the reader of Froude well. He was, as I have intimated, a successful and a busy merchant; and I had often marvelled at his familiarity with English 
<emph rend="italic">belles-lettres,</emph> and graver literature, the study of which is usually given up to so-called professional men. That hour a day explained it all. The crowded street-car was his sedan-chair. I also knew his critic; had seen him placed at such a woful disadvantage in the society of educated men and women, that my heart ached and my cheeks burned in sympathy with his mortification; had heard him deplore the deficiencies of his early training, and that the exigencies of his business-cares now made self-improvement impracticable. He would have protested it to be an impossibility
<pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=112"/>
that he could find a spare hour a day to devote to the neglected task; six hours a week--a whole day in a month, two weeks in a year. Yet a fortnight of news paper-reading and idle gossip would be a sorry entry in his year-book. For this lazy murder of time cannot, by any stretch of conscience, be classed as healthful recreation, any more than can the one, two, three, ten hours a week during which Mrs. Neverthink sits with folded hands, discussing fashions and her neighbors' frailties, the while her work is steadily doubling itself up, snowball-like, before the lever of each idle minute. All work and no play would make Mrs. Neverthink a dull and a diseased woman; but the fact is, she is not playing any more than she is working, as she sits, or stands to parley about trifles. She is only wasting time, making inevitable the haste. Oh! these "few words more," with which the Neverthink tribe prolong the agony of their would-be-if-they-could industrious sisters, and heap up the burden of their own coming cares! The words which mean nothing, the driblets of a shallow, sluggish stream that meanders into anybody's meadow, and spreads itself harmfully over the nearest pastures, instead of being directed into a straight, beneficent channel! "I haven't a bit of system about me!" wails the worried creature, when the ponderous snow-ball has finally to be heaved out of the way by her own hands.
</p>
<p>
It would be a matter of curious interest could I recount how often I have heard this plaint from those of my own sex who are thus straining and suffering. From some it comes carelessly--a form of words they have fallen into the habit of repeating without much
<pb n="101" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=113"/>
thought of what they mean. With a majority (I wish I were not obliged to say it!) it is rather a boast than a lament. The notable housekeeper who would be ashamed to admit that she does not look narrowly after paper and twine, bits of cold meat and scraps of butter, does not calculate wisely concerning coal, candle-ends and crusts--confesses, without a blush, that she takes no thought of the gold-dust, known among us as min utes and seconds, sifting through her lax fingers. By and by, she is as truly impoverished as if she had thrown away the treasure in nuggets, and then comes the lament, not repentance. She is "run to death with work, but she doesn't see how it is to be helped. All other housekeepers are the same. She never could economize time; has no genius for arranging her labors to advantage."
</p>
<p>
The building of such an one is the heaping together of boulders with crevices between, through which the winds of disappointment whistle sharply. System,--by which we mean a sagacious and economical apportionment of the duty to the hour and the minute; an avoidance of needless waste of time: a courageous putting forth of the hand to the plough, instead of talking over the work to be done while the cool morn ing moments are flying,--"System," then, is not a talent! I wish I could write this in terms so strong and striking as to command the attention, enforce the belief of those whom I would reach. It is not a talent. Still less is it genius. It is a duty! and she who shirks it does herself and others wrong. If you cannot order your household according to this rule, the fault is yours, and the misfortune theirs.
</p>
<pb n="102" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=114"/>
<p>
"We are living too fast!" is the useless note of alarm sounded from press, and pulpit, and lecture-room; echoed in a thousand homes, in various accents of regret and dismay; most fearfully by the rattling clods upon the coffin-lid, that hides forever the care-worn face of wife and mother, who has been trampled to death by the press of iron-footed cares. Is not this haste begotten by waste?
</p>
<p>
Is there any good reason why, in our homes--yours and mine, my toiling sister--and in those of our neighbors to the right and left of us, should not reign such method as prevails in our husbands' places of business? Why, instead of meeting the morning with uplifted hands and the already desponding cry, "I have so much to do I cannot decide what to lay hold of first!" we should not behold our path already mapped out by our provident study over-night--its certain duties; its probable stumbling-blocks; recreation, devotion and rest--each in its proper place? Why we should not be ready, "heart within and God o'erhead," to make the new day an event in our lives, a stepping-stone to higher usefulness to our kind and toward heaven? Why we should not bring to hindrance, as to duty, the resolute, hopeful purpose with which the miner bends over his pickaxe, the gardener over his spade, the book-keeper over his ledger? Why, in short, we should not magnify our office--make of housewifery, and child-tending, and sewing a profession--to be studied as diligently and pursued as steadily as are the avocations of the other sex?
</p>
<p>
I should not dare ask these questions, were I not already convinced, by years of patient examination of
<pb n="103" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=115"/>
the subject, that it is feasible for a clear-headed, conscientious woman to do all this, and more. Would not "dare," because I know by what a storm of indignant protest the queries will be met, not only from those who pride themselves upon the amiable foible of "having no system," but on the part of deep-hearted women who are really anxious to do their share of this world's great work.
</p>
<p>
The pale-faced mother over the way will tell me of the clutch of baby-fingers upon her garments whenever she essays to move steadily onward, and how the pres sure of the same holds her eyes waking through the night-watches; how the weight of baby-lips upon the breast saps strength and vitality together. Dear and precious cares she esteems these; but they leave little time or energy for anything else. The matron, whose younglings have outgrown childhood, is ready with her story of the toils and distractions of a family of merry girls who are "in society," and inconsiderate, unpunctual "boys," who look to "mother" to supply, for the present, the place of the coming wife to each of them. Martha, wedded and middle-aged, but child less, is overpowered by cares, "put upon her by every body," she relates, with an ever-renewed sense of injury wearing into her soul, "because it is believed that women without children have nothing to do."
</p>
<p>
One and all, they are eloquent upon the subject of unforeseen vexations, the ever-hindering "happenings" that, like the knots tied in wire-grass across the path by mischievous fairies, are continually tripping them up.
</p>
<p>
"Moreover," says Mrs. Practical, "there is little use
<pb n="104" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=116"/>
in attempting to be methodical and to save the scraps of time unless other people do. We are liable to have our precious hoard stolen at any moment. If my next-door neighbor persists in 'dropping in' whenever she feels lonely, or wants a receipt, or has a morsel of news she cannot keep, and cannot withdraw her unseasonable foot from my house under an hour at each visit, of what avail are my watchfulness and diligence?"
</p>
<p>
With her accustomed shrewdness, Mrs. Practical has put her finger upon the hardest knot of the tangle. Says that other model of sterling, every-day sense, Miss Betsy Trotwood, touching Mr. Micawber's difficulties: "If he is going to be continually arrested, his friends have got to be continually bailing him out--that is all!"
</p>
<p>
The family of Neverthinks ("may their tribe decrease!") act upon the reverse principle. If their acquaintances will be continually working themselves into line with the flying hours, they--the Neverthinks--must be zealous in pulling them to the rear. They are like an army of mice scampering through the tidy cupboards of Mesdames Practical and Notable. They claim, like Death, all seasons for their own. Against such there is no recognized law, and no redress except in the determined will and wise co-operation of their victims.
</p>
<p>
Dropping the fictitious personages, let us talk of this matter plainly, as face-to-face, dear reader! Why have women, as a class, such an imperfect conception of the value of time to themselves and to" others? To Mrs. Trollope belongs, I believe, the credit of bringing
<pb n="105" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=117"/>
into general use a word which, if not elegant, is so expressive that I cannot do without it in this connection. Why do women 
<emph rend="italic">dawdle</emph> away seconds and minutes and hours in playing at work, or affecting to play? A clever young girl was once showing me a set of chairs embroidered by herself. Knowing that she was her mother's efficient aid in the cares entailed by a large family, I asked her how she had made the time for the achievement.
</p>
<p>
"O! I did it in the betweenities!" she returned, gayly. "Between prayers and breakfast; between the children's lessons; between the spring and fall sewing; between morning and evening calls, and in a dozen other gaps. I had a piece of it always within reach, and every stitch taken was a gain of one."
</p>
<p>
We all need play--recreation, wholesome and hearty diversion. I would guard this point carefully. God-willing, we will talk of it, more at length, some time; but to make the day's work even and close, our life's work rich and ample, we must look well after the "betweenities."
</p>
<p>
Let me probe a little more deeply yet. Have not the prejudices and gallantries of generations had their effect upon the formation of feminine opinions on this head? begotten in many minds the impression that we are unjustly dealt with in being obliged to take up and carry forward as a life-long duty any business whatso ever? Is not the unspoken thought of such persons one of impatient disappointment at finding that earth is not a vast pleasure-ground and existence one long, bright holiday? If men will speak of and treat women as pretty playthings, they at least should not complain
<pb n="106" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=118"/>
when the dainty toy proves to be an unserviceable domestic machine. A man who acknowledges that he dislikes the business by which he earns his living is looked upon with instant distrust, as silly, indolent, or, at the best, unphilosophical. If his auditor has occasion to avail himself of the services of one of the craft to which the unwilling workman belongs, he will assuredly seek a man who would be likely to do himself and his employer more credit than can be given by his half-hearted labor. But housewives confess freely that they loathe housekeeping and all pertaining thereto. I speak that which I do know when I say that where you find one who works 
<emph rend="italic">con amore</emph> in her profession, there are two who drudge on grumblingly, and consider themselves aggrieved because the morning brings labor and the evening care. The fault begins very far back.
</p>
<p>
"If girls knew when they were well off, they would never marry."
</p>
<p>
"A butterfly before marriage--a grub afterward."
</p>
<p>
"Let well enough alone."
</p>
<p>
"She who weds may do well. She who remains single certainly does better."
</p>
<p>
These are specimens of the choice maxims shouted from the reefs of matrimony to the pleasure-shallops gliding over the summer sea beyond the breakers. By the time the boy begins to walk and talk, the sagacious father studies his tastes and capacity in selecting a trade for him; puts him fairly in training for the same so soon as he is well embarked in his teens; sees for himself that his drill is thorough and his progress satis factory. Of the lad's sisters their mother will tell you, with tears in her eyes, that she "cannot bear to tie the
<pb n="107" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=119"/>
dear girls down to regular duties. Let them take their pleasure now, for when they marry, trouble and responsibility must come."
</p>
<p>
Not seeing that to the unskilled apprentice the practice of his art must be cruelly hard; that her own loving hands are making tight the lashings of the load which the tender shoulders must bear until death cuts the sharp cords; that in her mistaken indulgence she is putting darkness for light, and light for darkness; bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.

<p>
"Presiding over an establishment like this makes sad havoc with the features, my dear Miss Pecksniffs," said Mrs. Todgers. "The gravy alone is enough to add twenty years to one's age. The anxiety of that one item, my dears, keeps the mind continually upon the stretch."
</p>
<p>
Without following the worthy landlady further into the depths of her dissertation upon the fondness of commercial gentlemen for the "item," I would answer a question addressed to me by a correspondent who "believes"-she is so kind as to inform me-"in Common Sense."
</p>
<p>
"I notice that many of your made dishes are de pendent for savoriness upon ' a cap of good broth,' or, 'half a cup of strong gravy.' Let me ask, in the spirit of sincere desire for useful information, where is the gravy or broth to come from?"
</p>
<p>
In return I plagiarize the words of a lady who ac complishes more with less noise and fretting than any other person I ever saw.
</p>
<p>
"I don't see how you find time for it all!" ex claimed an admiring visitor.
</p>
<p>
"I make it, if I can get it in no other way," was the rejoinder.
</p>
<p>
Never throw away so much as a teaspoonful of
<pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=154"/>
gravy of any kind. Season it rather highly, and set it away in a cool place until it is wanted. For a while you will have some difficulty in impressing the im portance of this rule upon your cook, especially if she is allowed to have all the "soap-fat" she can save as one of her "perquisites." This is a ruinous leak in any household, whether the oleaginous "savings" be exchanged for soap (hard or soft), or for money. It is so easy to "let it go into the fat-crock," and when the cook is to gain anything for herself by the laisser-aller the temptation is cruelly strong-even if she have a conscience. I have known the pile of unclean fat col lected for the soap-man to be swelled not only by the bits of butter left upon the plates after meals, but by quarter and half-pounds abstracted bodily from butter-tub or pot, and the abstraction never, in the phraseology of the "conveyer," to be "scrupled." "The wise convey it call!" said honest Pistol, and to no other ethical motto has heartier response been made by the comptrollers of culinary treasuries.
</p>
<p>
In a family of ordinary size nothing should find its way into the buckets of the unsavory caller at base ment-door or back-gate. The drippings from most kinds of roast meat, if settled, strained and skimmed, and kept in a clean vessel, answer for many purposes quite as well as butter, and better than lard. Even that from mutton should be "tried out," strained through muslin, slightly salted, and, if you choose, perfumed with rose-water, in which shape it is better than cold cream, or glycerine for chapped hands, and is a useful cerate for cuts, scratches, etc. The oil-cake should be removed from the top of all gravies before
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=155"/>
they are used upon the table; for, be it understood, grease is not gravy.
</p>
<p>
How often I have wished, from the depths of a loathing stomach, that certain well-meaning house keepers-at whose boards I have sat as guest or boarder -who fry beafsteak in lard, and send ham to table swimming in fat; upon the surface of whose soups float spheroids of oil that encase the spoon with blubber, and coat the lips and tongue of the eater with flaky scales-that these dear souls who believe in "old-fashioned cookery," understood this simple law of digestive gravity!
</p>
<p>
A "rich gravy," or "a strong broth," is not of ne cessity, then, one surcharged with fat. Beef-tea-which is the very essence of the meat, and contains more nourishment in small bulk than any other liquid used in the sick-room-should be made of lean, but tender beef, and every particle of suet be removed from the cooled surface before it is re-heated for the patient's use.
</p>
<p>
If you have no gravy ready when you wish to pre pare ragout, or other dish requiring this ingredient, "make it." Crack up the bones from which you have cut the flesh, and put them into a saucepan with the refuse bits of meat, gristle, skin, etc.; cover with cold water, and stew very gently until you have extracted all the nourishment, and from two cups of liquid in the pot when the boiling commenced, you have one cup of tolerable gravy. A few minutes of thought and preparation in your kitchen after breakfast will enable you to have anything of this kind in season for a luncheon dish, or an entree at the early dinner.
</p>
<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=156"/>
<p>
Foresight in these matters is to be forearmed. Teach your cook, furthermore, never to toss "that carcass" of fowl, or the ham, or mutton-bone, "with next to nothing upon it," to the dogs, or into the scavenger's barrel. It will not, by itself, make good soup, unless it be very much underdone, and even then the broth will not be equal to that made from raw meat or mar row bones. But, seasoned and thickened-adding sweet herbs and a dash of catsup to the flavoring-it will be useful as gravy in many ways; always re membering that it must be skimmed before it is used. It is also well worth your while to see for yourself, when the meat comes home from market, that it has been properly trimmed for the table. Much goes into the oven or upon the spit to be roasted, or upon the gridiron to be broiled, that is unfit to be eaten after it has been baked or grilled. All bits of tough skin-all gristly portions, soft bones, and the cartilage known as "whitleather" should be removed before cooking from roasts, chops, and steaks, when this can be done without injuring the shape of the meat. The place for these is the stew-pot. Cover them with cold water; put in no seasoning until they have simmered slowly for a long time in a close vessel, and the liquid is reduced to at most one-half of the original quantity; then season, boil up once hard, strain, and set aside until you want to try a receipt in which "a little good gravy" is a desideratum.
</p>
<p>
If you buy meat for gravy-which yon need not do very often, if yon (and your cook) are reasonably care ful about "scraps," cooked and raw-get the coarser pieces and marrow-bones pounded to bits. Cut up
<pb n="145" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=157"/>
the meat fine, also. You cannot, by never so long boil ing, extract the strength so completely from a solid "chunk" of flesh as from the same quantity shred into strips or cut into dice. It should be reduced to rags for gravies and soups, and invariably put on in cold water. Fast boiling hardens the meat and injures the flavor of the gravy. For the first hour, it should barely simmer. After that, stew very slowly and steadily. The best gravy is like jelly when cold.
</p>
<p>
Are these details trivial to absurdity? If they seem so to you, pray bear with my over-carefulness when I tell you how ignorant 1 was of minute economies when I assumed the name, and, so far as I could, the duties of a housewife, and how many others I have seen and talked with who are as anxious as was I, to stop the deadly little drains from the domestic system, yet know not where to begin.

It gives me great pleasure to present this receipt to those who, from prejudice or taste, do not like the presence of <ingredient>salad oil</ingredient> in any dish. I have known many who would not knowingly partake of salad, fricassee, or ragout, that had <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> in however small quantity, as one of its ingredients. And, unlike mince-pie, with the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> left out, or pie-crust, minus <ingredient>shortening,</ingredient> this <ingredient>oil</ingredient>-less salad is really delicious. Especially if a couple of <ingredient>raw eggs,</ingredient> well whipped, be added to the <ingredient>drawn butter,</ingredient> when almost cold.

Be careful not to do more than moisten it well, tossing up lightly with a silver fork. Then beat the rest of the <ingredient>vinegar sauce</ingredient> into the thicker mixture, which should by this time be perfectly cold. Pour over the salad; ornament the centre of the dish with flower-cups made of the hollowed halves of the <ingredient>whites of boiled eggs,</ingredient> with <ingredient>celery</ingredient>-tufts for petals.

<p>
In obedience to this last injunction, I once left my salad on the shelf of a "very cold" pantry, until it was slightly frozen all through-a misadventure I did not suspect until it came to table. With a desperate attempt at facetiousness, I introduced the compound as a novelty-"a salade glacee"-and, to my relief and surprise, found in the accident a parallel to the "Irish blackguard" snuff story. The spoiled dish was pro nounced by all far more delightful than the usual form of salad. I do not advise a repetition of the adventure on the part of any of my readers. Perhaps other guests might be less complaisant and flattering. It is hardly worth while to risk a cut glass dish on the chances of success.
</p>
<p>
Use the liquor in which the chickens were boiled for soup.

The day on which this cheese-pudding first appeared on my table is marked with a " very good." It is a
<pb n="158" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=170"/>
pretty, cheap and palatable 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;e</emph>, such as yon need never be ashamed to set before any guest, however fastidious.
</p>
<p>
Let me say, in this connection, in explanation not apology, for my running commentary upon receipts like the above, that it is made--the commentary, I mean, "with a purpose." The unexpected guest is sometimes an embarrassment, sometimes a horror to the inexperienced housewife.
</p>
<p>
"I remembered the <ingredient>cold duck</ingredient> in the pantry with exceeding joy; summed up the contents of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and cake box to a crumb, between the <ingredient>foot</ingredient> of the stairs and the front-door," confessed one to me. "By the time I had said 'How do you do?' all around, and kissed the babies, I remembered, with a sick thrill, that the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was low and the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> out (we don't drink it ourselves), and that the whole party of new-comers must, at that hour of the evening, be ravenously hungry.
</p>
<p>
It is wise and provident to arm oneself against such occasions by practice in the manufacture of what may be called "surprise-dishes." With a crust of <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> in the larder, half a loaf of dry <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> a few spoonfuls of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and a bit of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> one is tolerably armed against an unlooked-for and unseasonable arrival. Give the guest my 
<emph rend="italic">fondu</emph>, with a good cup of <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> or <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> or glass of <ingredient>ale;</ingredient> <ingredient>bread</ingredient>-and-<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> cut thin, and your brightest smile, and he will not complain, even inwardly, should the <ingredient>cold duck</ingredient> be wanting.

An empty <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-box, and 1/4 yard of very stout, coarse lace.
</p>
<p>
Knock top and bottom out of one of the small boxes used for holding table-<ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and cleanse the broad and the narrow rims remaining, thoroughly. When dry, fit over the bottom of the box itself a piece of new strong net lace, or mosquito-netting. Fasten it in place by pressing down over it the rim of the top. The net should be drawn tightly and smoothly. Tack both rim and net to the outside of the box with small tacks driven through the former, leaving the <ingredient>heads</ingredient> protruding, that they may he easily withdrawn. This is your cheese-press. If you can get a small wire sieve with 
<emph rend="italic">coarse</emph> meshes, it will save you trouble. The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should have been set aside until it thickens or "loppers," in a solid curd. Inside of your mould lay a piece of clean <ingredient>white</ingredient> tarletane, fitted neatly to the sides and bottom, and projecting all around above the press. Pour in the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> opening the flakes gently with a spoon to allow the <ingredient>whey</ingredient> to reach the bottom of the press, but do not stir it. Set the mould upon two slender sticks laid on a bowl, and let it drip two days. If the mould will not hold all the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> add it during the first day, as the curd sinks. By the third day it will be a rich, smooth mass. If not quite firm, trim down the round board you took out of the top, cover the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> with a thin cloth, and press the board firmly upon it. Lay a weight on this--not heavy enough to break the net--and leave for some hours longer. A saucer or small plate will do almost as well as the board. When the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> is ready to eat, which will be when it is firm, remove the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> from the top by

<chapter class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">LUNCHEON.</hd>
<p>
A YOUNG friend of mine who had not long been a wife and housekeeper, on returning from a morning drive, one day, was met at the door by the intelligence that her widower brother, who was a member of her family, had brought three gentlemen home with him to dinner. Her husband had not yet come in, and although not naturally nervous, she repaired forthwith, and in some trepidation, to the kitchen, to see for herself that the early dinner, which was then customary in the household, because more convenient for the master's business, was in satisfactory progress.
</p>
<p>
The range was hot and the top empty; the tables clean and also empty; ditto the cook's hands, while her terrified face had the hue of her whitest dish-towel.
</p>
<p>
"Don't you think, ma'am," was her salutation, "that the marketing has never come home at all, at all, and not a bit of meat, nor so much as a pertater in the house! Whatever will we do? and lashin's of company in onexpected!"
</p>
<p>
The mistress was equally dismayed when a glance at the clock showed that it was past twelve. The market-house closed at noon; her residence was out of the region of butchers' and green-grocers' shops. It was evident that the plethoric hamper, she had seen filled by her usually careful provision merchant and left at
<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=181"/>
his stand in the market to be delivered at her door early in the forenoon, had miscarried, or been overlooked.
</p>
<p>
"Whatever shall we do?" The despairing cry rang through her like a knell; a cold trembling seized her limbs, and she dropped helplessly into a chair.
</p>
<p>
"Has nothing come, Mary? Not even the meat for soup?"
</p>
<p>
"Sorra a sup, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
"Cannot you think of something that can be made quickly? You told me you were a good hand at getting up nice dishes at short notice!"
</p>
<p>
The Celt's 
<emph rend="italic">pose</emph> was tragic.
</p>
<p>
"An' it was a thrue word I spake, whin I said it. But an angel couldn't make something out of nothing, or it's meself that would thry!"
</p>
<p>
Matters were too serious for the poor lady to suffer her to smile at the implied assumption of angelic relationship.
</p>
<p>
"Something must be done, nevertheless," she uttered, desperately, and, with a woman's instinct of leaning upon rugged masculine strength when deserted by feminine wit, she sought the billiard-room, whither the inconsiderate brother had conducted his visitors, happily unsuspicious as themselves of the poverty-stricken larder, or the qualms that were racking the secretary of the interior.
</p>
<p>
He showed an exasperatingly good-humored face at the door in answer to her knock.
</p>
<p>
"Come in!" he said blithely, and would have flung wide the door, but for the agonized gesture that beckoned him into the entry.
</p>
<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=182"/>
<p>
In a whisper as agonized, she explained the situation. He reflected a moment.
</p>
<p>
"Any pie, or cake in the house? fruit, fresh or preserved?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, all," impatiently. "But it isn't a question of dessert. There is literally nothing for 
<emph rend="italic">dinner</emph>."
</p>
<p>
"I understand! I have it! We'll be fashionable for once. Set on sardines, cheese, pie, cake, claret and sauterne, and a dish or two of fruit. Make a royally strong cup of coffee> to wind up with, and 
<emph rend="italic">call it luncheon!</emph>"
</p>
<p>
In fifteen minutes the guests were summoned to the dining-room, where the pretty hostess, in a becoming 
<emph rend="italic">demi-toilette</emph>, welcomed them as the friends of her husband and brother, and presided over the collation from which not one of them perceived that anything was lacking, like a gracious little queen. A lisp of apology would have spoiled all, and she had tact enough to avoid the danger.
</p>
<p>
"That man is a Napoleon in small matters!" said I, when she told me the story. " If he never says another good thing, his--'Call it luncheon,' should win him lasting fame with all housekeepers who hearken to the tale of his masterly strategy."
</p>
<p>
I have given the anecdote at length, that the reader may have the benefit of all the lessons it conveys.
</p>
<p>
First--Assure yourself, whenever it is practicable, that the materials for dinner are in the house several hours before the time for serving it arrives.
</p>
<p>
Secondly--It is a wise plan to keep sardines, canned salmon and lobster, cheese, and potted meats on hand always, with preserved fruits, and not to let the stores of cake and crackers run too low.
</p>
<pb n="171" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=183"/>
<p>
Thirdly--There is scarcely an imaginable domestic disaster on an ordinary scale, that cannot be rectified, or, at least, modified into passableness by presence of mind and energetic action. "Call it luncheon," is a capital motto in other and graver perplexities than the non-arrival of a day's marketing, and where higher interests are concerned than the feasting or fasting of half a dozen people.

<p>
After twelve years' trial of this receipt, I have come to the conclusion that there is no better or more reliable rule for the manufacture of <ingredient>corn-bread.</ingredient> In all that time, there has hardly been a Sunday morning, winter or summer, when the family was at home, on which a loaf of this <ingredient>bread</ingredient> has not graced my breakfast-table, and unless when, through negligence, it has been slightly scorched or underdone, I have never known it to come short of excellence.
</p>
<p>
In cutting <ingredient>corn-bread,</ingredient> do not forget to hold the knife 
<emph rend="italic">perpendicularly</emph>, that the spongy interior of the loaf may not be crushed into heaviness. Very good <ingredient>corn-bread</ingredient> is often ruined by neglect of this precaution.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">WHAT I KNOW ABOUT EGG-BEATERS.</hd>
<p>
IN no department of nice cookery are the effects of lax or hasty manipulation more sadly and frequently apparent than in such dishes as are dependent for excellence upon the lightness and smoothness of beaten eggs. Unless yolks are whipped to a thick cream, and whites to a froth that will stand alone, the texture of cake will be coarse, and if the loaf be not heavy or streaked, there will be a crude flavor about it that will betray the fault at once to the initiated. The same is emphatically true with regard to muffins, waffles, and griddle-cakes. Mr. Greeley said, and aptly, of two publishers of note: "One will make a louder rattle with a hundred dollars than the other can with a thousand." I have often recalled the remark in contrasting the tender, puffy products of one housewife's skill with the dense, clammy cakes and crumpets of another, who used double the quantity of eggs and butter, and cream instead of milk.
</p>
<p>
" I think," observed a friend, at whose house I was visiting, "there must be a mistake about the muffin receipt you gave me the other day. It calls for three eggs. My cook insists that five are none too many, yet her's, when made, do not look or taste like those I ate at your table."
</p>
<pb n="197" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=209"/>
<p>
In reply I craved permission to see the batter mixed by the critical cook. Entering the kitchen in company with the mistress, we found Chloe in the act of breaking the five eggs directly into the flour, milk, etc., already mixed in a large bowl. Half a dozen strokes of the wooden spoon she held would have completed the manufacture of the raw material. Eggs are inveterate tell-tales, and they had given no uncertain warning in this case, had the mistress been on the alert.
</p>
<p>
Some eggs cannot be frothed. The colored " mammys " used to tell me that they were "bewitched," when, with every sweep of the wisp they were depressed and dwindled before my wondering eyes. I have learned since that, whether this non-inflative state be the result of undue warmth of the dish into which the eggs are broken, or staleness of the ovates themselves, it is a hopeless task to attempt rehabilitation. Their demoralization is complete and fatal. The wise housewife will give up her cake or dessert for that day, unless she is willing to throw the obdurate eggs away, cleanse the bowl, wiping it perfectly dry, and let it cool before attacking another batch.
</p>
<p>
Nor will whites froth to stiffness if a single drop of the yolk has found its way into them. Regardless, as a leader of the cod-fish aristocracy, of the claims of early associations upon memory and respect, they sullenly assert the impossibility of rising in the world if they are to be clogged by that which lay so close to them before the shells were broken. All the beating of the patent egg-whip in impatient fingers will not suffice to make them see reason. The fact that there is ten-fold
<pb n="198" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=210"/>
more nourishment and sweetness in one yolk than in a pint of their snowy nothingness; that it is, in truth, the life, without which an egg would be a nullity, has no more effect in changing their exclusive notions than have volumes of argument proving the solidity and vitality of the middle classes upon the gaseous brains of the 
<emph rend="italic">bon ton.</emph> Humor their folly-for whites are useful, because ornamental, if rightly handled-by carefully taking out the offensive plebeian speck.
</p>
<p>
Our mothers whipped up yolks with a spoon, and the whites with a broad-bladed knife, or clean switches, peeled and dried. Miss Leslie's " Complete Cookery " will tell you all about it. (And, by the way, if you doubt that fashions change in cookery as in all else, I commend to your perusal this ancient manual.) Then came a rush of patent egg-beaters, and a rush of purchasers as well, whose aching wrists and shoulders pleaded for relief from long hours of inces-sant " beating," "whipping," and "frothing." There were wire spoons with wooden handles that broke off, and tin handles that turned the perspiring hand black; wire whirligigs that ran up and down upon a central shaft and spattered the eggs over the face and bust of the operator; cylindrical tin vessels with whirligigs fastened in the centre, almost as good fun for the children as a monkey on a stick, but which bound the housewife to place and circumstance, since her eggs, many or few, yolks and whites, must all be churned in that vessel-not an easy one to keep clean, on account of the fixture within it. There was altogether too much machinery for the end to be accomplished, and the white of a single egg was so hard to find in the bottom
<pb n="199" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=211"/>
of a quart pail! After a few trials, the cook tossed the "bothering thing" into a dark comer of the closet, and improvised a better beater out of two silver forks, held dexterously together. Then, our enterprising "general furnishing" merchant overwhelmed us with a double compound back (and forward) action machine that was "warranted to whip up a stiff 
<emph rend="italic">m&#233;ringue</emph> in a minute and a half."
</p>
<p>
"I will not quite endorse that, ladies," said the most important tradesman in a community of housekeepers and housekept. "But I will stake my reputation upon its doing this in two minutes."
</p>
<p>
We all bought the prize. It looked cumbrous, and it 
<emph rend="italic">was</emph> expensive, but time is money, and we remembered that a large snow-custard must be beaten ninety minutes with an ordinary egg-whip, and cake-frosting, thirty. We paid, each of us, our dollar and a half, and carried home the time-and-muscle-saver in a box of its own, so big that we chose back streets in preference to fashionable promenades, on our return. Trembling with exultation, we rushed into the kitchen to display the treasure.
</p>
<p>
" Yes, mem ! What might it be, mem ? "
</p>
<p>
" Why, Katey ! an egg-beater ! and the greatest convenience ever manufactured ! "
</p>
<p>
" Ah! and what a silly was meself, mem, to be thinking it was a coffee-mill, when I saw you a-screwin' it on to the table ! "
</p>
<p>
We screwed it " on to the table," at a corner, for there was not room for it to revolve at sides and ends. Katey held a bowl with eggs in it at just the right elevation below; and by turning a crank we moved a many-
<pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=212"/>
cogged wheel which fitted into another wheel, which turned a whirligig at the bottom. Katey held the bowl steadily; we worked very fast at the windlass-handle, and in eight minutes the 
<emph rend="italic">m&#233;ringue</emph> was ready.
</p>
<p>
" Well done ! " cried housewives, one and all. " Great is the Grand duplex back (and forward) action Invention," for the amelioration of weary-wristed womankind ! To be sure, it takes two people to work it, unless one can hold the bowl firmly between the knees in just the right place, but it is undeniably a wonderful improvement,"
</p>
<p>
I, with the rest, cried, "wonderful !" even when the bowl tipped over on the kitchen-floor, with the yolks of ten eggs in it; when I broke the screw by giving it one turn too many, and was blandly assured by the artificer in metals, to whom I took it for repairs, that "them cast-iron articles can't never be mended, ma'am, without it is by buying of a new one ;" even when the cogs of the wheels became rheumatic, and hitched groaningly at every round. But when one day, in full flight through a seething heap of icing, the steel strips of the triple whirligig that did the whipping, suddenly caught, the one upon the other, and came to a dead lock; when, as I would have released them by an energetic revolution of the wheel, they tore one another out by the roots,-I arose in deadly calm; undid the screw, set the bowl on the table, straightened my cramped spine, and sent to the nearest tin-shop for a shilling whisk.
</p>
<p>
Four years ago, without prevision that one of the blessings of my life was coming upon me, I paid a visit to 
<emph rend="italic">my</emph> "house-furnisher." He had a new egg-beater for sale.
</p>
<pb n="202" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=214"/>
<p>
variable fidelity, and it is to all appearance, stanch as when it first passed into my reluctant hands. I hope the gentlemanly and benevolent donor will sell one thousand per annum for the remainder of his natural existence, and if length of days be a boon to be coveted, that the unknown patentee will live as many years as he has saved hours of labor to American housewives and cooks.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">WHIPPED CREAM.</hd>
<p>
THIS enters so largely into the composition of many of our most elegant desserts, that the mode of preparing it deserves more than a passing mention. The impression in which 1 confess that I shared, for a long time, that a "whip" was a tedious, and sometimes well-nigh impossible performance, will soon be done away with if one becomes the possessor of a really good syllabub charm. That which I have used with great satisfaction for a couple of years is a very simple affair- a tin cylinder with a perforated bottom, and within it a dasher, similar to that of an ordinary churn, that plays through a hole in the top. It is best to churn the cream in a jar or pail, there being in these less waste from splashing. The churn is held about a quarter of an inch from the bottom, that the cream may pass freely below it. As the stiffened froth rises to the top of the cream, it should be removed to a wire sieve set over a dish. If you have no sieve, lay a piece of coarse lace or tarletane within a cullender, and put the "whip," a few spoonfuls at a time, upon it. The cream that drips into the dish below should be returned to the pail and churned over. I regret that the name of the patentee appears nowhere upon the modest but excellent little machine that has supplied me with so many trifles and Charlotte Russes.
</p>
<pb n="204" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=216"/>
<p>
The grand desideratum in making a "whip," is to have 
<emph rend="italic">real</emph> cream. It should also be perfectly sweet, The confectioner from whom I always procure mine advised me once to put the merest pinch of soda in the cream in warm weather, before beating it, a hint that has proved very useful to me. With this precaution, unless the cream be really on the verge of souring, you will never churn your "whip "to butter, of which lame and lamentable conclusion I had experience several times before I received the friendly suggestion.
</p>
<p>
Get good cream, then. It is better worth your while to pay half a dollar a quart for it than half the sum for the thinner, poorer liquid sold under the same name at the milk-stores. In the country, of course, the true article should be abundant, and in town, you can generally purchase small quantities at the confection-ers. A pint well worked will yield enough "whip" for the dessert of a small family. It should be kept in a cold place until needed, and not kept long anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Whipped cream is a delightful addition to coffee. John will relish his after-dinner cup much better if you will mantle it with this snowy richness. Remember this when preparing your syllabub or trifle, and set aside a few spoonfuls before seasoning it.
</p>
<p>
Don't be afraid of undertaking "fancy dishes." Sally forth bravely into the region of delicate and difficult dainties, when you are considering family bills of fare, and you will not be dismayed when called to get up a handsome "company" entertainment. "Grandmother's way" may suit Mesdames Dull and Bigott, but you, being accustomed to use your reasoning powers)
<pb n="205" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=217"/>
should remember that our estimable maternal progen-itore knew as little of locomotives and magnetic tele-graphs as of canned fruits and gelatine.
</p>
<p>
And, 
<emph rend="italic">entre nous,</emph> I for one, and my John for two, are getting BO tired of the inevitable pie ! He read aloud to me the other day, with great gusto, a clever editorial from the 
<emph rend="italic">Tribune,</emph> showing with much ingenuity and force, that the weakness for pie was a national vice. I wish I had room here to reprint it. Whenever I . have been compelled since to eat a triangle of " family pie-crust," my usually excellent digestion has played me false.
</p>
<p>
"Pie and soda-water! That is a woman's idea of a comfortable luncheon on a hot day in the city," said a gentleman to me. "At a bit of rare, tender steak, and a mealy potato they would turn up their fastidious noses. Such gross food is only fit for a 
<emph rend="italic"> man.</emph> "
</p>
<p>
The school-girl, rising from a barely-tasted breakfast during which she has been saying over to herself the chronological table, or French verb, learned the night before,-"doesn't care to take any luncheon with her to-day. Certainly, no bread-and-butter-and sandwiches are 
<emph rend="italic">hateful !</emph> If you insist, mamma, just give me a piece of pie-mince-pie, if you have it, with a slice of fruitcake and a little cheese. I may feel hungry enough at noon to nibble at them."
</p>
<p>
Papa, running in at eleven o'clock, to announce that he has had a business telegram which obliges him to take the next train to Boston or Chicago, "has not time to think of food, unless you can give me a bit of pie to eat while yon are packing my valise." He jumps from the cars at five P.M. to snatch another "bit of pie" from
<pb n="206" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=218"/>
a station-restaurant, and swallows still a third, at midnight, bought from an itinerant vender of such comes-tibles, who swings himself on board when the "through Express" halts for wood and water. If his sick headache is not overpowering, he is adequate to the consumption of still a fourth leathery triangle when another stop is made at six A.M.
</p>
<p>
Pie is the 
<emph rend="italic">pi&#232;ce de r&#233;sistance</emph> in rural desserts, at luncheon and at tea, and the mighty army mustered to meet the attacks of pic-nics and water-parties in the course of the year is enough to drive a dyspeptic to suicide, when he reads the sum total of the rough computation.

"I always calculate to bake a dozen of a Saturday," says the farmer's helpmate, resigned to cheerfulness in the narrative. "In haying and harvesting I make as many as thirty and forty every week. Nothing pleases our folks so much when they come in hot and tired, as a bit of pie-it don't make much difference what kind -apple, berry, squash, or damson-so long as it is 
<emph rend="italic">pie!</emph>"
</p>
<p>
This is not exaggeration, and the same mania for the destructive sweet is as prevalent among the working-classes of the city. It is useless to preach to artisans and laborers of the indigestible qualities of such pastry as is made by their wives at home, and bought at cheap bakeries; to represent that baked apples, and in the season, ripe, fresh fruits of all kinds are more nutritious, and even cheaper, when the prices of flour, sugar, and "shortening" are reckoned up, to say nothing of the time spent in rolling out, basting and baking the tough-skinned, and often sour-hearted favorites.

<p>
Jellies are scorned as "having no substance into them ;" blanc-mange is emphatically "flummery," and whipped cream I have heard described scornfully as "sweetened nothing."
</p>
<p>
Do not understand my strictures upon pie-olatry to mean indiscriminate condemnation of pastry. A really fine mince-pie is a toothsome delicacy, and the like quality of pumpkin-pie a luscious treat. Christmas would hardly be Christmas without the one, and I would have the other grace every Thanksgiving feast until the end of time. But surely there is an " out of season," as well as " in."

<p>
" Your Toxes and your Chickses may draw out my two front double teeth, Mrs. Richards," said Susan Nipper," but that's no reason why I need offer 'em the whole set ! " 
</p>
<p>
And when I recall the square inches of hard and slack-baked dyspepsia I have masticated-and swal-lowed-at the bidding of civility, and a natural soft-heartedness that would not let me grieve or shame hos-pitable entertainers, I can say it almost as snappishly as she.
</p>
<p>
Give John, then, and above all, the children, a res-pite from the traditional, conventional and national pie, and an opportunity to compare its solid merits with the graces of more fanciful desserts. I can safely promise that the health of the family will not suffer from the change.

<p>
You can vary the coloring by making <ingredient>white</ingredient> and yellow blanc-mange out of one-quarter of the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> after it is soaked.

<hd align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">NOTE UPON JELLIES.</hd> It must be home in mind that the consistency of jelly depends much upon the weather. In warm or damp, it is sometimes difficult to make it either clear or firm. I have tried to guard against failure in the use of any of the foregoing receipts by setting down the 
<emph rend="italic">mininum quantity</emph> of liquid that can be used without making the <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> too stiff. If made in clear, cold weather, there will be no risk in having the " large cup of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient>" in which the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> is soaked, one-third larger than if the <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> were undertaken on a

<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">PUDDING-DISHES.</purpose> The baking-dish of " ye olden time" was never comely; often positively unsightly. Dainty housewives pinned napkins around them and wreathed them with flowers to make them less of an eyesore. In this day, the pudding-maker can combine the aesthetic and useful by using the enameled wares of MESSRS. LALANGE AND GROSJEAN, 89 BEEKMAN STREET, NEW YORK. The pudding-dishes made by them are pretty in themselves, easily kept clean; do not crack or blacken under heat, and are set on the table in handsome stands of plated silver that completely conceal the baking-dish. A silver rim runs around the top and hides even the edge of the bowl. They can be had, with or without covers, and are invaluable for <ingredient>macaroni,</ingredient> <ingredient>scallops,</ingredient> and many other "baked <ingredient>meats.</ingredient>" Saucepans and kettles of every kind are made in the same ware by this firm.

<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">FRITTERS.</purpose> Not even so-called pastry is more ruthlessly murdered in the mixing and baking than that class of desserts the generic name of which stands at the <ingredient>head</ingredient> of this bake. Heavy, sour, sticky and oleaginous beyond civilized comparison, it is no marvel that the compound popularly known and eaten as "fritter" has become a doubtful dainty in the esteem of many, the object of positive loathing to some.
</p>
<p>
I do not recommend my fritters to dyspeptics and babies, nor as a standing dish to anybody. But that they can be made toothsome, spongy and harmless, as well as pleasant to those blessed with healthy appetites and unimpaired digestions, I hold firmly and intelligently.
</p>
<p>
Two or three conditions are requisite to this end. The fritters must be quickly made, thoroughly beaten, of right consistency,-<emph rend="italic">and</emph> they must not lie in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> the fraction of a minute after they are done. Take them up with a perforated spoon, or <ingredient>egg</ingredient>-beater, and lay on a hot sieve or cullender to drain before serving on the dish that is to take them to the table. Moreover, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> must be hissing hot when the hatter goes in if you would not have them <ingredient>grease</ingredient>-soaked to the very <ingredient>heart.</ingredient> Line the dish in which they are served with tissue-<ingredient>paper</ingredient> fringed at the ends, or a clean napkin to absorb any lingering drops of <ingredient>lard.</ingredient>

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">CONCERNING ALLOWANCES.</hd>
<hd align="center">(CONFIDENTIAL-WITH JOHN.)</hd>
<p>
I DO not like that word "allowance." It savors too much of a stipend granted by a lordling to a serf; a government pension to a beneficiary; the dole of the rich to the poor. But since it has crept into general use as descriptive of that portion of the wife's earnings which she is permitted to disburse more or less at her discretion, we must take it as we find it.
</p>
<p>
Marriage is to a woman one of two things-licensed, and therefore honorable beggary, or, a copartnership with her husband upon fair and distinctly specified terms. When I spoke of the wife's earnings just now, it was not with reference to moneys accumulated by work or investments outside of the home which she occupies with you and your children. We will set aside, if you please, the legal and religious fiction that you have endowed her with all-or half your worldly goods, and put still further from our consideration the sounding oaths with which you protested in the days of your wooing, that you cared nothing for pelf and lucre-Cupid's terms for stocks, bonds and mortgages, houses and lands-except that you might cast them at her feet. If you recollect such figures of speech at all, it is with a laugh, good-humored, or shame-faced, and the plea that everybody talks in the same way in like circumstances; that pledges thus given are in no wise to be
<pb n="295" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=307"/>
regarded as promissory notes. Hymen's is a general court of bankruptcy so far as such obligations go. Your wife is a sensible woman, and never expected to take you at your word-at least, such hot and hasty words as those, in which you declared yourself to be the most abject of her slaves, and herself the empress of your universe, including the aforementioned stocks, mortgages, houses and lands, real and personal estate-all assets 
<emph rend="italic">in esse</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">in posse</emph>.
</p>
<p>
Having cleared away, by a stroke of common sense, this gossamer, that like other cobwebs, is pretty while the dew of early morning impearls it, and only an annoyance afterward; particularly odious when it entangles itself about the lips and eyes of him who lately admired it-we will look at the question of the wife's work and wages from a business point of view-pencil and paper in hand.
</p>
<p>
First, we will determine what should be the salary of a competent housekeeper; one who makes her employer's interests her own; who rises up early and lies down late, and eats the bread of carefulness; who is not to be coaxed away by higher wages, and is never in danger of giving warning if her "feelings are hurt;" if the servants are insubordinate, or the master is given to fault-finding, and not always respectful to herself. It would be to your interest, were you a widower, you confess, to give this treasure two dollars a day-as women's wages go. "And," you add in a burst of manly confidence, "she would be cheap at that." But we will put down her salary in round numbers, at $700 per annum.
</p>
<p>
Now comes the seamstress' pay. Again, a "competent
<pb n="296" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=308"/>
person," one who is ever in her place; whose work-hours number fourteen out of the twenty-four, if her services are required by you or the children; whose needle is always threaded, her eye ever vigilant; with whom slighting and botching are things unknown by practice; who takes pride in seeing each of the household trig and tidy; who "seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands;" who is an adept in fine needlework as in plain sewing, and not a novice in dress-making; who, perchance, can "manage" boys' clothes as well as girls-who will do it, of a certainty, if you explain that you cannot afford tailors' bills for urchins under ten years of age; finally, who possesses that most valuable of arts for a poor man's wife.
</p>
<p>
"To gar auld claes look a'maist as weel as new."
</p>
<p>
Shall we allow to this nonpareil the wages of an ordinary seamstress who "cannot undertake cutting and fitting,"-one dollar a day? Or, is she entitled to the pay of a dressmaker's assistant-half a dollar more ? I do not want to be hard with you. We will set her down for $450 a year. And, again, we conclude that you have made a good bargain.
</p>
<p>
Next, the nursery-governess, and perhaps the most important functionary in the household. She must, you stipulate, have charge of the children, by day and night; guard morals, health and manners, besides teaching the youngerlings the rudiments of reading and writing; must superintend the preparation of the elder ones' lessons for school-recitations, and look to it that catechism and Bible-lesson are ready for Sabbath-school; that musical exercises are duly practised; that
<pb n="297" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=309"/>
home is made so attractive to the boys that they shall not be drawn thence by the questionable hilarity of engine-house and oyster-cellar. A lady the must be, else how would your girls be trained to modest and graceful behavior, and your friends be entertained as you deem is due to you and to them, in your house? A responsible, judicious person is indispensable to the comfort and health of yon and yours; one who does not regard the care of a young baby as " too confining; " nor sleepless nights on account of it, a valid reason for " bettering herself; " nor a brisk succession of measles, mumps and chicken-pox cogent cause for informing you that she "didn't engage for this sort of work, and would you be suiting yourself with a lady as has a stronger constitution-immediate, for her trunk is packed."
</p>
<p>
"Would a thousand dollars per annum provide you with such a hireling ? I knew a wealthy man who offered just that sum for a nursery-governess during the protracted illness of his wife. She must be intelligent and ladylike, he stated, qualified to undertake the education of the three younger children. There were six in all, but there was a tutor for the boys. The governess' bed-room adjoined that of the little girls, the door of which must stand open all night. The baby's crib was to be by her bed, and a child, three years old, was also to share her chamber. She would be treated respectfully and kindly, and every enjoyment of the luxurious establishment, compatible with the proper discharge of the duties appointed, would be hers.
</p>
<emph rend="italic">He could get no one to take the place.</emph>
<p>
This is simple fact, and it is pregnant with meaning.
</p>
<pb n="298" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=310"/>
<p>
Nevertheless, what if we put down the wages of your nursery-governess at the same sum you are willing to give your housekeeper-$700? Oblige me by adding up the short row of figures under your hand.
<list><item>$700</item><item>450</item><item>700</item><item>----</item><item>$1,850</item></list>
</p>
<p>
This you will please consider as the amount of your wife's salary, due from you for services rendered, exclusive of board and lodgings, which are always the portion of resident employees in your house. There is no charge for "extras," you observe. We have said nothing about the bill for nursing you through that four weeks' spell of inflammatory rheumatism last winter, or the longer siege of fever, three years ago, when this scrvant-of-all-work eat up with you fourteen weary nights, and would entrust the care of you to no one else. By her skillful ministrations, the miracle of her patience, love and prayers, you were rescued, say the doctors, from the close clutch of death. You cannot see the figures very distinctly while you think of it, but we agreed, at the outset, to keep feeling in the background.
</p>
<p>
You "have tried to be a kind, affectionate husband," you say, in a very unbusiness-like way.
</p>
<p>
I believe you, and so does the blessed little woman whom I have shut out from this conference, lest her foolish fondness should spoil the effect of our matter-of-fact talk. I would have you and all husbands be
<pb n="299" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=311"/>
<emph rend="italic">just</emph>, no less than loving. Let us return to our figures The estimate is for a man of moderate means and modest home, one of the middle-class which is everywhere the bone and muscle of the community-the class that makes national character, the world over. If you are wealthy, and put the care of a large and elegant establishment upon your manager, the remuneration should be in proportion. For a fancy article you have to pay a fancy price. You misunderstand your wife and me, if you imagine that we would inaugurate in your household a debit and credit system and quarter-day settlements. She would be the first to shrink from such an interpretation of your mutual relations. I should, of all your friends and well-wishers, be the last to recommend it.
</p>
<p>
But I have studied this matter long and seriously, and I offer you as the result of my observation in various walks of life, and careful calculation of labor and expense, the bold assertion that every wife who performs her part, even tolerably well, in whatever rank of society, more than earns her living, and that this should be an acknowledged fact with both parties to the marriage contract. The idea of her dependence upon her husband is essentially false and mischievous, and should be done away with, at once and forever. It has crushed self-respect out of thousands of women; it has scourged thousands from the marriage-altar to the tomb, with a whip of scorpions; it has driven many to desperation and crime.
</p>
<p>
"Every dollar is a lash! " I once overheard a wife say, in bitter soliloquy, as her husband left her presence after placing in her hand the money for which
<pb n="300" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=312"/>
she had timidly asked him, to pay the weekly house-hold bills.
</p>
<p>
Then, still supposing herself unseen, she threw the roll of bank-notes upon the floor and trampled it under foot, in a transport of impotent, and, to my way of thinking, righteous wrath.
</p>
<p>
"An exceptional case?" I beg your pardon! I wish it were. Her husband meant to be kind and affectionate as honestly as do you. When money was "easy," he would give it to her freely and cheerfully, provided his mood was propitious at the time of her application. He had expended large sums in the purchase of jewelry and handsome clothing for her, and exulted in seeing her arrayed in them. He loved her truly, and was proud of her. His mistake was in ignoring the fact that he owed her anything in actual dollars and cents; that she worked for her livelihood as faithfully as did he, and that his debt to her was, in the highest degree, a "confidential" one. If put into the confessional, he would have admitted that he thought of; himself as the only bread-winner of the family, and was, sometimes, tartly intolerant of the domestic demands upon his earnings. He made a yet grosser mistake in feeling and behaving as if the money deposited in her hands for the current expenses of the establishment, were a gift to her personally. This is a masculine blunder that poisons the happiness of more women than I like to think of, or you would be willing to believe. Be kindly-affectioned as you will, your wife cannot respect you thoroughly if she sees that you are habitually unreasonable and unjust. And it is neither just nor rational to speak and act as
<pb n="301" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=313"/>
if all the butter, flour, sugar, meat and sundries which she saves you the trouble of buying, and of which, nine times out of ten, she is the more judicious purchaser, were to be consumed by her, and her alone.
</p>
<p>
"You never thought of such a thing!" you protest betwixt laughter and vexation.
</p>
<p>
Then, do not act as if it were your settled conviction.
</p>
<p>
Set aside from your income what you adjudge to be a reasonable and liberal sum for the maintenance of your family in the style suitable for people of your means and position. Determine what purchases you will yourself make, and what shall be intrusted to your wife, and put the money needed for her proportion into her care as frankly as you take charge of your share. Try the experiment of talking to her as if she were a business partner. Let her understand what you can afford to do, and what you cannot. If in this explanation you can say, "we," and "ours," you will gain a decided moral advantage, although it may be at the cost of masculine prejudice and pride of power. Impress upon her mind that a certain sum, made over to her apart from the rest, is hers absolutely. Not a present from you, but her honest earnings, and that 
<emph rend="italic">you</emph> would not be honest were you to withhold it. And do not ask her "if that will do?" any more than you would address the question to any other workwoman. (With what cordial detestation wives regard that brief query, which drops, like a sentence of the creed, from husbandly lips, I leave your spouse to tell you. Also, if she ever heard of a woman who answered anything but "yes.")
</p>
<pb n="302" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=314"/>
<p>
Advise her, for her own satisfaction, and because it is " business like," to keep an account of her receipts and expenditures, but apprise her distinctly that you do not expect her to exhibit this to you, unless she should need your assistance or advice in balancing her books, or in some perplexed question of "profit and loss." She will be ready to appreciate that the one sum deposited with her is a trust fund to be used to the best advantage for the general good, and the proud consciousness that she is the actual proprietor of the other, and irresponsible, save to her conscience, for the manner in which it is spent, will make her the more careful not to use it amiss. As to the housekeeping money -the weekly or monthly " allowance"-you may be very sure that you and the children will get the benefit of every cent. However economically she may handle her private store, the bulk of it will not be increased by surreptitious pinchings from the family supply of daily bread.
</p>
<p>
I have known women whose sole perquisites were what they could save from their not large allowances, who, in the absence of their husbands from home, would keep themselves and families of hungry, growing children,-with the consent and co-operation of the latter-upon the most meagre fare consistent with the bare satisfaction of the cravings of nature, that the few dollars thus spared might go toward the purchase of some coveted article of dress for one of the girls; a set of tools or books for a boy, or a piece of furniture desired by all. Which bit of economy (!) being reported to the 
<emph rend="italic">paterfamilias</emph> when the dearly-bought thing was exhibited, was pronounced by him, his hand
<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=315"/>
complacently finding its way to the plethoric wallet in his pocket, to be worthy of his august approval. How many husbands have heard their wives remark how cheaply the family lived when "papa was away?" and how many have asked themselves seriously why and how this was done?
</p>
<p>
Other women, and more to be pitied, I am acquainted with, who make false entries in the account-books, which are showed weekly to their lords as explanatory of "the way the money goes." It is easier and less likely "to make a fuss," to record that seven pounds of butter have been bought and used, his lord-ship having helped in the consumption thereof, when by sharp management, five have sufficed; to write down "new shoes for Bobby, $4,00," when, in reality, the cost of mending his old ones that they might last a month longer, was only $1,50,-than to confess to the practical critic who does not overlook a single item, that the money " made" by these expedients was spent, partly in paying up a yearly subscription to the Charitable Society; partly for an innocent luncheon during a day's shopping in the city.
</p>
<p>
" Unjustifiable deception ? " Have I pretended to excuse it ? But I look back of the timid woman-the pauper, bedecked in silks, laces and gems,-for most men like to see their wives dressed as well as their neighbors-the moral coward, who has lied from the natural desire to handle a little money for herself without being cross-examined about it-and ask-" by what stress of humiliating tyranny was she brought to this?"
</p>
<p>
All women do not manage monetary affairs well,
<pb n="304" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=316"/>
you remind me, gently. Some are unprincipled in their extravagance, reckless of everything save their own whims and unconscionable desires. Must a man beggar himself and those dependent upon him, lest such an one should accuse him of parsimony? By yielding to demands he knows to be exorbitant, he proves himself to be weaker even than she.
</p>
<p>
I have said nowhere that a woman is the best judge of what her husband ought to appropriate from his gains or fortune for the support of his family. But he stands convicted of a grave error of judgment, if he has chosen from the whole world as the keeper of his honor and happiness, a woman whom he cannot trust to touch his purse-strings.
</p>
<p>
Let us be patient as well as reasonable. So long as a babe is kept in long clothes, and carried in arms, it will not learn to walk alone. The majority of women have been swathed in conventionalities and borne above the practicalities of business by mistaken tenderness or misapprehension of their powers, for so long, that, however quick may be their intuitions, time and practice are necessary to make them adepts in financiering. The best way to render them trustworthy is not by taking it for granted, and letting them see that you do, that they have sinister designs upon your pockets. They are not pirates by nature, nor are they, even with such schooling as many get from their legal proprietors, always on the alert to wheedle or extort a few dollars for their own sly and selfish ends. After all, is there not a spice of truth in the would-be satire of the old distich?

<p>
If you chance to be painfully conscious of the mental inferiority and warped conscience of your partner in the solemn dance of life; if there is more "worse" than "hotter" in the everyday wear of the matrimonial bond; if sloth and waste mark her administration of household affairs, instead of the industrious thrift you would recommend, and which you see others practise; if the rent in the bottom of the pouch carries off the money faster than you can drop it in, you are to he pitied almost as much as your bachelor neighbor, who sews on his own buttons, and depends upon boarding-houses for his daily food. Still, my friend, is there any reason why you should accept the consequences of this one mistake on your part, with less philosophy; bring to the bearing of it a smaller modicum of Christian resignation than you summon to support you under any other? Women have been as grievously misled by fancy or affection, before now, and have borne the burden of disappointment to the grave without murmur or reproach.
</p>
<p>
Then, there is always the chance that your wife ie not " understood," or that, well-meant as your attempts to " manage " her have been, you have not selected the most judicious methods of doing this. In this enlightened and liberal age, nobody, unless he be bigot or fool, habitually thinks and speaks of women as a lower order of intelligent beings. But even in your breast, my ill-mated friend, there may lurk a touch of the ancient leaven of uncharitableness, and in your treatment of her " whom the Lord hath given to be with you," there may be a spice of arrogance, the exponent of which, were you Turk or Kaffir, would be brute force.

" I do not object to your proposal, my love. You always have your own way in household affairs," said a very " kind and affectionate " man to his wife, with the air of a potentate amiably relinquishing his sceptre for love's sake.
</p>
<p>
"Will you tell me, my dear husband, why, if I conduct 'household affairs' wisely and pleasantly (and you have often acknowledged that I do!) I should not have my own way ?" was the unexpected reply, uttered in perfect temper-no less sweetly for being an argument. " For twenty years I have made domestic economy a constant and practical study. Is it reasonable to suppose that, after all this expenditure of time and thought, I am not a better judge of ways and means in my profession than are you, whose life has been spent in other pursuits? For all your indulgent affection to me, as displayed in a thousand ways since our marriage-day, I love and thank you. But excuse me for saying that I am not grateful that you have, as you are rather fond of saying, 'made it a point to give me my head' in all pertaining to housekeeping. That you do this shows that you are just and honorable. It is no more a

The husband stroked his beard thoughtfully. He was a sensible man, and magnanimous enough to recognize the truth that his wife was a sensible woman.

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">RIPE FRUIT.</hd>
<p>
THE sight of the fruit-dish or basket upon the breakfast table has become so common of late years that its absence, rather than its presence, in the season of ripe fruits would be remarked, and felt even painfully by some. It is fashionable, and therefore considered a wise sanitary measure, to eat oranges as a prelude to the regular business of the morning meal. Grapes are eaten so long as they can be conveniently obtained. It may be because my own taste and digestion revolt at the practice of forcing crude acids upon an empty, and often faint stomach, that I am disposed to doubt the healthfulness of the innovation upon the long-established rule that sets fruit always in the place of dessert. I have an actual antipathy to the pungent odor of raw orange-peel, and have been driven from the breakfast-table at a hotel more than once by the overpowering effect of the piles of yellow rind at my left, right, and opposite to me. A cluster of grapes taken before breakfast would put me, and others whom I know, 
<emph rend="italic">hors de combat</emph> for the day with severe headache. In the consciousness of this, I can be courageous in declining the " first course " of an 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode</emph> breakfast, and at my own table, withholding the fruit until the stomach has regained its normal tone under the judicious application of substantial viands. Then, it is
<pb n="309" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=321"/>
pleasant to linger over the vinous globes of crimson, purple, and pale-green; to dip ripe strawberries in powdered sugar with lazy gusto; to pare rosy rareripes and golden Bartletts while discussing the day's news and plans, in the serene belief that the healthful, delicious juices are assimilating whatever incongruous elements have preceded them in the alimentary canal.
</p>
<p>
I write this, not to guide the practice of other households, but to enforce a remark I see all opportunity for bringing in here. Be a slavish follower of no custom whatsoever. It is sensible and expedient to act in uniformity with your neighbors when you can do so without moral or physical injury. Conformity to a foolish or hurtful fashion is always weak, if not positively wicked.
</p>
<p>
Serve your fruit, then, as the first or last course at your family breakfast as may seem right to yourself, but, by all means, have it whenever you can procure it comfortably and without much expense. In warm weather, you had better banish meat from the morning bill of fare, three days in the week, than have the children go without berries and other fresh fruits. Make a pretty glass dish, or silver or wicker basket of peaches, pears or plums, an institution of the summer breakfast. In autumn, you can have grapes until after frost; then, oranges and bananas if you desire. These, being expensive luxuries, are not absolutely enjoined by nature or common sense. Let the " basket of summer fruit," however, be a comely and agreeable reality while solstitial suns beget bile, and miasma walks, a living, almost visible presence, through the land.
</p>
<p>
Fruits each in its season, are the cheapest, most
<pb n="310" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=322"/>
elegant and wholesome dessert you can offer your family or friends, at luncheon or tea. Pastry and plum-pudding should be prohibited by law, from the beginning of June until the end of September. And in winter, a dish of apples and oranges flanked by one of boiled chestnuts, and another of picked walnut or hickory-nut kernels, will often please John and the bairns better than the rich dessert that cost you a hot hour over the kitchen-range, when Bridget was called away to a cousin's funeral, or Daphne was laid up with "a misery in her head."
</p>
<p>
Among the creams, jellies and " forms " of a state-dinner dessert, fruit is indispensable, and the arrangement and preparation of the choicer varieties is a matter for the taste and skill of the mistress, or her refined daughters, as are the floral decorations of the feast.

Bake in two large loaves, or four smaller ones. My own preference is for small loaves of cake. They are safer in baking, and can be cut more economically, especially where the family is not large. It is better to cut up the whole of a small cake for one meal, than to halve or quarter a large one, since the outer slices must be dry at the next cutting, and are wasted, to say nothing of the effect of the air upon the whole of the exposed interior.
</p>
<p>
The Sultana must be baked slowly and carefully, and like all <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-cakes, longer than a plain one. Ice thickly. It will keep very well.

<p>
THE evening meal, call it by whatever name we may, is apt to be the most social one of the three which arc the rule in this land. The pressure of the business allotted to the hours of daylight is over. The memory and the conversation of each one who comes to the feast, are richer by the history of another day. It is sometimes hard to " make talk " for the breakfast table. The talk of the six o'clock P.M. dinner, or supper, or tea, makes itself. I frankly own that, however much may be said in favor, on hygienic grounds, of early meals for the nursery, the mid-day dinner for adults has always worn for me a grim, and certainly an unpoetical aspect. The " nooning" should, for the worker with muscles, nerves, or brains, be a light repast and easily digested, followed by real physical rest. He is weary when he comes to it; he eats in haste, his mind intent upon the afternoon's work, and he may not tarry when it is dispatched, having already " lost" an hour in discussing (or bolting) soup, salad, fish, meat and dessert. The weight of undigested food seems, during the succeeding hours of business or study, to shift its position and clog and heat the brain.
</p>
<p>
" I will not preach to roast-beef and plum-pudding!" said America's greatest preacher, in refusing to hold a Sabbath afternoon service.
</p>
<pb n="357" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=369"/>
<p>
People quoted the 
<emph rend="italic">bon mot</emph> approvingly. Few had common sense enough to apply it to week-day occupations. If men and women would rest, after an early dinner on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, as long and absolutely as they do on Sabbath afternoons, there would be less money made, perhaps, but fewer stomachs destroyed, and fewer intellects overstrained.
</p>
<p>
This, however, as Paul candidly remarks touching certain of his deliverances--" I say of mine own judgment." And, after all, I should be the sorriest of the sorry to see the tea-table swept out of American households. While I write, there come stealing back to me recollections that tempt me to draw my pen through some lines I have just set down. Late dinners and late suppers used to be the fashion, seldom altered--in Southern homes. In summer, the latter were always eaten by artificial light. In winter, lamps were brought in with the dessert, at dinner-time. I was almost grown before I was introduced to what the valued correspondent who gave us the text for the first "Familiar Talk " in this volume calls, "a real old New England tea-table." During one delicious vacation I learned, and reveled in knowing, what this meant. Black tea with cream, (I have never relished it without, since that idyllic summer) rounds of brown bread, light, sweet, and fresh; hot short-cake in piles that were very high when we sat down, and very low when we arose; a big glass bowl of raspberries and currants that were growing in the garden under the back windows an hour before; a basket of frosted cake; a plate of pink ham, balanced by one of shaved, 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> chipped
<pb n="358" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=370"/>
beef-and 
<emph rend="italic">sage cheese</emph>! I had never eaten it before. I have never tasted it anywhere else than in that wide, cool tea-room, the level sun-rays flickering through the grape-vines shading the west side of the house, and through the open casements opposite, a view of Boston bay--all purple and rose and gold, dotted with hundreds of white sails. This was what we had, when, in that Old New England farm-house, Polly, the faithful--who had startled me, for a time, by saying, "proper glad," and " sweet pretty;" who " hadn't ought " to do this, and " should admire " to do that--Polly, whom nobody thought of calling a servant, but was a " help" in every conceivable sense of the word--had "put the kettle on and we all had tea!"
</p>
<p>
I do not like to think it possible that in that beloved homestead they may have kept up with the times so far as to have dinner at six o'clock, and tea-never!
</p>
<p>
It is a pleasant practice, in many families, where the late dinner is convenient, and, for many reasons, preferred during the rest of the week, to have a " comfortable tea " on Sabbath evening. The servants are thus released the earlier for their evening's devotions or recreations; the housewife has an opportunity of indulging the father, who is seldom at home at luncheon-time, with dainty wonders of her skill that are not 
<emph rend="italic">en r&#232;gle</emph> at dinner, and the children have a taste of old-fashioned home-life, the memory of which will be carried by them as long and fondly into their afterlives as I have borne the taste and fragrance of Cousin Melissa's sage cheese. We do not say " Cousin," nowadays in polite society, nor christen our children Melissa. You will find elsewhere in this book that I
<pb n="359" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=371"/>
have directed you, as preliminary to frosting fruit for dessert--peaches, apricots and nectarines--first to rub off the down (which makes the softness of the blush) with a rough cloth.
</p>
<p>
It may be a weakness, but I for one, like to remem-ber while admiring the pretty conceit of the 
<emph rend="italic">glac&#233;</emph> peach, how it looked before it was rubbed bright, and sugar-coated.

I introduce these directions for the domestic manufacture of such extracts as are most used in cooking, chiefly, but not altogether for the benefit of country readers. The land--town and country--is so deluged now with makers and peddlers of " flavoring extracts," that some, of necessity, must be indifferent in quality, if not hurtful. I have purchased from a respectable druggist in a large city, <ingredient>rose-water</ingredient> that smelled like ditch-<ingredient>water,</ingredient> and tasted worse; <ingredient>essence of lemon</ingredient> that could not be distinguished by the sense of taste or smell from varnish; and <ingredient>vanilla</ingredient> that was like nothing I had ever tasted or smelled before--least of all like heliotrope, new-mown hay, or <ingredient>vanilla-bean.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
The answer to my complaint in each of these cases was the same. "I cannot understand it, madam. The <ingredient>extract</ingredient> is of Our Own Make, and there is no better in the American market!"

<p>
In country stores the risk of getting a poor article is of course much greater. To this day, I recall with a creep of the flesh that drives a cold moisture to the surface, the unspoken (at the moment) agony with which I detected something wrong, and very far wrong in some nice-looking custards, the manufacture of which I had myself superintended, and that formed the staple of the dessert, to which I set down a couple of unexpected guests. As the first spoonful touched my <ingredient>tongue,</ingredient> I looked at John, and John looked (pityingly) at me! By mutual consent, we began to press the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> upon our friends, and I hastened the entrance of the coffee-tray.
</p>
<p>
After dinner, we snatched a few words from one another, aside.
</p>
<p>
"The cook's carelessness!" said he. "She got hold of the liniment-bottle by mistake."
</p>
<p>
"It was a fresh bottle of 'pure <ingredient>vanilla</ingredient>!'" answered I solemnly. "I saw her draw the cork!"
</p>
<p>
It was after this experience that I was assured there was "no better article in the American market."

I keep in what may be called my "accident drawer," red flannel, divided into bandages of various lengths, and to these is recourse had in slight, and even violent cases, instead of to drugs. If the patient is suffering intense pain, steep a flannel pad large enough to cover the affected part, in 
<emph rend="italic">hot</emph> spirits (you may add a little laudanum in severe cases) and bind upon the abdomen with the flannel bandage, renewing whenever the sufferer feels that it is growing cold.
</p>
<p>
Above all things else, 
<emph rend="italic">keep the patient quiet</emph> in bed, if possible, but in a recumbent position-and the feet warm with flannel or bottles of hot water. These are always preferable to bricks, or hot boards for warming the extremities, being clean, safe and good preservers of heat.
</p>
<p>
The diet should be light and nourishing, avoiding liquids and acids as much as possible. Let the patient quench his thirst by holding small bits of ice in his month, or, if heimust drink, let him have mucilaginous beverages, such as gum-arabic water. The burning
<pb n="391" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=403"/>
thirst consequent upon these diseases may be measurably allayed by eating, very slowly, dry <ingredient>gum arabic,</ingredient> which has, likewise, curative qualities.

<p>
ONLY a few, lest the patience I have already had occasion-and more than once-to praise, should fail at the last pages. And if, in my desire to be brief, I seem abrupt, you will understand that it is not because I do not enjoy talking with, and at you.
</p>
<p>
Be honest with me! Have you ever, in studying these two volumes which I have tried to make as little dry as the subject would admit, whispered, or thought something that implied a likeness between the author and the anonymous gentleman, in whose garden-
</p>
<p>
"The wild brier,<lb/>The thorn and the thistle grew higher and higher? "
</p>
<p>
I used to know Watts from title-page to "finis." I have taken pains to forget the creaking numbers of his pious machinery of late years. But wasn't the aforesaid personage the one who "talked of eating and drinking? " Have you ever said, 'twixt amusement and impatience, " This woman thinks all women born to be cooks, and nothing more? " As I look at the matter of every-day and necessary duty-the routine of common life-" common " meaning anything but vulgar-there are certain things which 
<emph rend="italic">must</emph> be learned, whether one have a natural bias for them or no. All men and women who would maintain a respectable
<pb n="399" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=411"/>
position in this enlightened land at this day, must learn how to read and write; must possess a fair knowledge of the multiplication-table, have a tolerably correct impression as to what hemisphere and zone they live in, whether in a kingdom or republic; must be able to describe the shape of the earth, and to tell who is the President of the United States. Next to these, in my opinion, stands the necessity that every woman should know how to use her needle deftly, and have a practical acquaintance with the leading principles of cookery. The acquisition of these homely accomplishments can never, in any circumstances, harm her. The probability is, that she cannot perform her part aright as spinster, wife, mother, or mistress without them.
</p>
<p>
I have a lovely child waiting for me on the "thither shore," whose many playful and earnest sayings are still quoted by us in our family talks, quite as often with smiles as with tears. Hera was a sunny life. Wo knew that should the Father prolong her earthly existence into womanhood, the power of 
<emph rend="italic">making</emph> her happiness would be no longer ours. But while our children 
<emph rend="italic">were</emph> children, to us belonged the precious prerogative of flooding their hearts with delight, making of home a haven of joy and peace they would never forget, whatever the coming years might bring. Our darling, then, was a happy, healthy child, and symmetrical in mind as body-learning readily, and usually with ease, the simple lessons suited to her years. Yet at nine years of age, she said to me one night before going to bed:
</p>
<p>
"Mamma, when I remember as I lay my head on the pillow, every night, that I have to say the 9 column
<pb n="400" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=412"/>
of the multiplication-table tomorrow, I could almost wish that I could die in my sleep, and the morning never come! "
</p>
<p>
With my heart aching in the great pity I could ill-express to one so young, I took her in my arms and told her of the need she would have, in after-life, of the knowledge gained so hardly; how, setting aside the actual utility of the multiplication-table, she would be better, wiser, stronger, always for the discipline of the study.
</p>
<p>
She lived to laugh at the recollection of the fearful bug-bear. Do I recall the incident with the least shade of remorse that I did not yield to my compassion and her pleading eyes, and remit, for good and all, the dreaded exercise? On the contrary, I am thankful the strength was given me to teach her how to battle and to conquer. And-I say it in no irreverent spirit of speculation-I have faith to believe that in the richer, deeper life beyond, she still, in some way or sense, reaps the good of that which she won by resolute labor, and by the victory over her faint-heartedness.
</p>
<p>
I have thought of the little circumstance, a hundred times, when women have bemoaned themselves, in ray hearing, over the hardship of being compelled to "understand something about housekeeping."
</p>
<p>
Since the "understanding" is a need, and patent even to their unwilling eyes, what say Common Sense and Duty?
</p>
<p>
My dear, I would not breathe it if there were a man within possible hearing-but are yon not sometimes ashamed that women are content to know and to do so little in this world?

"So are many men!" True, but that is the look-out of masculine philanthropists--not ours. How many ladies in your circle of acquaintances are willing--much to eager to do anything, except the positive and well-defined work laid upon them by custom and society? How many enter into the full meaning and have any just appreciation of the beauty of the duties especially appointed to 
<emph rend="italic">them</emph>, of the glory and solemnity of maternity, the high honor of being the custodians of others' happiness so long as life shall last; GOD'S deputies upon earth in the work of training immortal souls; of forming the characters and lives that shall outlive the sun?
</p>
<p>
How many-to descend to a very plain and practical question-could, if bereft of fortune tomorrow or next week, or next year, earn a living for themselves, to say nothing of their children ?
</p>
<p>
I talked out this last-named question on paper, a few months ago; threw arguments and conclusions into a form which I hoped would prove more attractive to the general reader, than a didactic essay. The last favor I shall ask of you before closing this volume, is that you will read my unpretending story through, and answer to yourself, if not to me and the public, the question put in the title.

Her husband laughed. Not sneeringly; but as good-natured men always do laugh when women talk of finding their way out of a labyrinth by means of the clue of argument.

"You will accomplish no more than your conventions and women's rights books "-

<p>
"Don't call them

</p>
<p>
"I speak of the sex at large, my love. No more, then, than women's rights books and conventions have achieved. All their battle for the equality of the sexes; the liberation of women from the necessity of marriage as a means of livelihood; for more avenues of remunerative labor, and the acknowledgment of the dignity of the same-now that the smoke has cleared away, and combatants and spectators can look about them-is seen to have resulted in nothing, or next to nothing. You have encouraged a few more women to paint poor pictures, and spoil blocks and plates in attempts to practise engraving; put some at bookkeepers' desks where they are half paid; crowded the
<pb n="403" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=415"/>
board-rooms of our public schools with applicants at the rate of a hundred for each vacancy; induced a similar rush upon telegraph offices, and every place where 'light, lady-like labor' can be procured; brought down, rather than raised the salaries in each of these departments of industry-and made marriage more than ever the

</p>
<p>
"Philip! how you exaggerate!"
</p>
<p>
"Not in the least, my dear, sanguine wife! Who puts on her rose-colored spectacles whenever the subject of 'woman's emancipation' is brought forward. I have studied this matter as closely as you have; hopefully, for a while, but, of late, with the fast-growing conviction that Nature and Society yoked arc too strong a team for you to pull against. Combat the assertion as you will,-it is natural for a woman to look forward to matrimony as her happiest destiny; to desire, and to bring it about by every means which seems to her consistent with modesty and self-respect And to this conclusion Society holds her by the refusal to receive into the 'best circles' her who earns her living by her own labor. Mrs. Million treads the charmed arena by virtue of her husband's wealth. But, when Mrs. Sangpur is envious of her dear friend's latest turn-out in equipage, dress, or furniture, she recurs, tauntingly, to the time when Mrs. Million was a work-girl in Miss Fitwell's establishment, and shrugs her patrician shoulders over 'new people.' As Miss Fit-well's assistant, forewoman, and successor, Miss Bias--now Mrs. Million-were she rich, refined, beautiful,
<pb n="404" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=416"/>

"But there are distinctions of social degree, Philip, which must be maintained. You don't bring your bootmaker home to dine with Judge Wright, or Honorable Senator Eider."

<p>
"I am not a reformer, my love. "When my bootmaker fits himself for the society of those yon name, he will be welcomed by them, and his early history referred to as an honor, not disgrace. The annals of Court and Congress will tell you this. To return to the original question; I insist there is a want of practicalness-I won't say of common sense-in your reform, as heretofore conducted; that no one woman in five thousand, especially in what are called the higher walks of life, is able to support herself, or would be allowed by popular sentiment to do so, were she able. There is a screw loose somewhere, and very loose at that. I, for one, am never rid of the rattle. Maybe, because I am the father of three daughters. If I had sons, I should be condemned by the entire community; stand convicted at the bar of my own conscience, if I had not trained each of them to some trade or profession. As it is, the case stands thus: I may live long enough to accumulate a fair competency for each of ray girls, a sum, the interest of which will support her comfortably; for she, being a woman, will never increase the bulk of the principal. My more reasonable hope is to see her married to an energetic business man, or one who has inherited a fortune and knows how to take care of it. This accomplished, parental responsibility is supposed to end, so far as provision for the life
<pb n="405" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=417"/>
that now is, goes. If her husband should fail, or die a poor man--the Lord help her and her children--if I cannot ! "

"Our girls have been carefully educated," said Mrs. Hiller, a little hurt at the turn the dialogue had taken. "In this country a thorough education is a fortune. They could set up a school."
</p>
<p>
"To compete with a thousand others conducted by those who have been trained expressly for this profession; whom constant practice has made 
<emph rend="italic">au fait</emph> to the ever-changing modes of instruction and fashionable text-books. Why, I, whose Latin salutatory was praised as a model of classic composition, and who read Horace, Sallust, and Livy in the original almost every day, cannot understand more than half the quotations spouted in the court-house and at lawyers' dinners, by youngsters who have learned the 'continental method' of pronunciation. I cannot even parse English, for the very parts of speech are disguised under new names. A noun-substantive is something else, an article is a pronoun, and, what with adjuncts, subjects, and modifiers, I stand abashed in the presence of a ten-year-old in the primary department of a public school. Our girls might go out as daily governesses at a dollar a day, or run their chances of getting music scholars away from professionals by offering lessons at half price. They are good, intelligent, and industrious. I don't deny their ability to make a bare living, if forced to do it. I don't believe they could do more. When

the rainy day comes, He who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, must be their helper. Let us hope that day will never dawn.

We won't cross the bridge before we come to it. Here is 'Old Kensington' to amuse you.

"I could ask no fairer destiny for my daughters than has been mine," murmured the mother, resettling herself in her luxurious chair before the sea-coal fire, and putting out her hand for the book the thoughtful kindness of her husband had provided for her evening's entertainment. " But to every prize, there are so many blanks! It is worse for a woman to sell herself for a home and a livelihood than for her to fight, hand-to-hand with poverty, all her life.

The book lay, still shut, in her lap. She folded her

hands upon it; lay back in the chair, and did not move again in an hour. She was "thinking it out;" pulling hard on the oar in the teeth of head-wind and fog. 
</p>
<p>
She was haunted by the Payne girls. Their father a popular physician, had lived handsomely; worked hard; been exemplary in his home, his profession, in church, and in city. He sent his five daughters to the best schools, and fitted them by culture and dress to make a creditable appearance in the world-the only world they cared for-a round of visits, parties and show-places for marriageable young people of both sexes. They were nice girls, said complaisant Everybody. Not beautiful, or gifted, but sprightly, well-bred and amiable-the very material out of which to make good wives and mothers. Two did marry before the sad day on which their father was brought home in an apoplectic fit, from which he never rallied. They married for love, but not imprudently. Their husbands were merchants with fair prospects, steady, enterprising, moral young men, who were yet not quite disposed to be burdened with the care of a maiden sister-in-law-and-a-half apiece in addition to the support of their families proper. That somebody would have to "look after the unmarried daughters was soon bruited about. There were two boys-five and ten years old-to be educated; the widow to be, pro-vided for, and, when the estate was settled up, nothing except a life-insurance of eighteen thousand dollars was left with which to compass all this. Tender-hearted Everybody was sorry for the fatherless boys; sorrier for the widow, who had loved her husband very truly; sorriest for " the Payne girls."' Before their
<pb n="408" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=420"/>
mourning was rusty, appreciative Everybody began to nudge Everybody Else slyly, when in company with the Payne girls, to call attention to the fact, daily more and more palpable, that the sisters three were anxious to get married. Not more anxious, if the secrets of feminine hearts had been revealed, than were dozens of others in their set, but they had not the art to dissemble their eagerness. Nobody stayed his, or her laugh at them by considering that, since they had deliberately, conscientiously, and humanely determined to relieve their mother from the crushing weight of their dependence, and saw no other way of doing this than by selling themselves in the licensed and respectable shambles of matrimony, they should have been commended for doing with all their might whatsoever their hands found to do. They angled earnestly, but with a zeal so little according to knowledge that the most bull-headed gudgeon in the preserved waters of bachelor and widower-dom scorned to be imposed upon by the bait. They borrowed the finery of their better-off sisters; made their own and their mother's over and over again; went everywhere and tried every phase of fascination, "from grave to gay, from lively to severe," until their eager, ceaseless smiles wore wrinkles about lips and eyes that ill-natured Everybody called crows-feet, and the tales of their fawnings, toadyisms, and manoeuvres were stale in the ears of greedy Everybody-yet were still, at thirty-six, thirty-eight, and forty years of age, the Payne girls, "whose brothers were now able to do something to them." What more suitable than that these fine young fellows-one of whom had chosen his father's profession, while the other had gone into partnership with his
<pb n="409" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=421"/>
brother-in-law, should bind pillions upon their backs whereon their sisters could ride in reputable indolence, behind the wives they had wedded and had a right to cherish?
</p>
<p>
"It was a pity," considerate Everybody now began to whisper, "that they should be thus hampered; but what else could be done?"
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Hiller's fresh-colored, matronly face might well be grave, as she recounted these things to herself, had the history of the Payne girls been an isolated case.
</p>
<p>
"But they are a type of so many!" she said, sadly. "Society is encrusted with such, like barnacles sticking to a ship. There is Lewis Carter, one of the ablest young lawyers at the bar, Philip says. He and Annie Morton have been in love with one another ever since he was twenty-one, and she nineteen, ten years ago. It is eight since his father died, and left him in charge of his mother and three sisters, only one of whom is younger than himself. They have not married, and, until they do, he cannot. Annie may wait for him until they are both fifty years old and upward-maybe all their lives-for the older the sisters grow, the more dependent they will become. They make a pleasant home for him, people say; manage his money judiciously, and fairly worship their benefactor. Yet he must compare them, mentally, to leeches, when he reflects how youth and hope are ebbing out of his heart and Annie's. No doubt leeches are sincerely attached to what they feed upon. What right have they to expect a support from him, more than he from them? They are strong and well, and as much money
<pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=422"/>
was spent upon their education as upon his. House-keepers, forsooth! Does it take four women to keep one man's house ?"
</p>
<p>
She was rowing very hard now, and the fog was denser than ever.
</p>
<p>
"There is Mr. Sibthorpe, with his four girls and three boys, and a salary, as bank-teller, of two thousand dollars a year. The daughters all 'took' French and music lessons at school. One of them is 'passionately fond' of worsted work; another does decalcomanie flower-pots and box-covers for fairs, and all crochet in various stitches, and one is great upon tatting. They 'help about house,' as our grandmothers used to say, all four of them; do contrive, with the aid of their mother and a strapping Irish girl, to keep the house-work tolerably in hand, and 'have in' a dressmaker and seamstress, spring and fall, to give them a fresh start. They don't read a book through once a year; they have no connected plans about anything, except to appear as well as girls whose fathers are worth ten times as much as is theirs-and to get married! They murder time by inches while waiting for the four coming men; 
<emph rend="italic">mince</emph> it into worthlessness with their pitiful fal-lals of fancy work and the fine arts (save the mark!). Evelyn told me, the other day, that the sprig of wax hyacinths she showed me-a stiff, tasteless spike, that smelled of oil and turpentine-'occupied' her for ten hours! "What will become of them when their pale, overworked father dies? It is frightful to think of a vessel thus freighted and cumbered being tied to safety by such a worn, frayed cord as that one man's life."
</p>
<pb n="411" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=423"/>
<p>
A dash of sleety rain against the window interrupted her.
</p>
<p>
"Philip said there would be a storm before morning. I wonder if he took his umbrella? He never thinks of himself. I am sorry he had to go out at all with such a cold."
</p>
<p>
"One man's life!" What flung the words back at her? What had she and her petted daughters between them and comparative - maybe absolute-poverty, save the life of this man, who, with a heavy cold on his lungs, had gone out into the fierce March night? Who would dare prophesy that his dream of amassing a competency for his children would be fulfilled? Why should she be vexing her soul with speculations about the Payne, and the Carter, and the Sibthorpe girls, when other women, as wise and far-sighted as she, were perhaps asking aloud, in friendly or imperti-nent gossip over their respective firesides, what would become of the "poor Hillers," in the event of their father's death.
</p>
<p>
She felt very much as if her barque had, like Robin-son Crusoe's ship, "with a shock, Struck plump on a rock!" What were 
<emph rend="italic">her</emph> daughters good for, if the question should arise how to keep the wolf from their own door? There was Philip's life-insurance (everybody insured his life nowadays) of fifteen thousand dollars, secured to herself; and this house in which they lived, the lowest valuation of which was twenty thousand--and some-thing--she wasn't sure how much besides. That is, she supposed something would be left when all outstanding
<pb n="412" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=424"/>
accounts were paid. Say, however, that they would have thirty-five thousand clear. At six per cent interest, this would bring, she estimated, after a pause, an income of twenty-one hundred dollars per annum. Provided she sold the house! That was a pang, even in imagination. Out of this sum must come rent, fuel, clothes, and a thousand etceteras for a family of four grown people, whose present income was, at the least, ten thousand a year.
</p>
<p>
"Good Heavens!" The rosy face blanched even under the ruddy rays of the sea-coal fire. "Say, then, that we were worth fifty thousand dollars, free of incumbrance. That would be only three thousand a year; and, as Philip says, we could do nothing to increase the principal. Why we would have to be economical, if we had double that sum. And few men's estates yield more. How do widows and orphans who have been reared in luxury, live, when the strong staff is broken? I seem never to have understood until this instant what helpless wretches women are; how most helpless of all classes are those who know themselves, and who have always been known as 
<emph rend="italic">ladies</emph>, born and bred. Is there a remedy, a preventive for this? Is it impracticable to throw out an anchor to windward? What was the origin of this insane, wicked, cruel prejudice against independent thought and vigorous work on the part of women, that fills every rank of life with miserable wives, and mothers who ought never to be entrusted with the care of children? Does He, who can make even wickedness the instrument of His purposes, permit this to flourish rank in Christian lands, that the world may be lawfully populated?"
</p>
<pb n="413" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=425"/>
<p>
In the boat again, and in very deep, murky waters, but tugging at the oar with all the energy of her practical, commonsensible character. 
</p>
<p>
"Philip says teaching does not pay any longer; nor painting, nor music, nor fine sewing. What does?"
</p>
<p>
Through the smooth, oily heart of the big lump of coal on the top of the mass in the grate, placed there carefully by Mr. Hiller's tongs before he went out, ran a concealed layer of slate, not wider than a man's finger, nor thicker than a plate of mica. But when the fire touched it, it cracked, and the big, justly-balanced lump exploded with force that sent the fragments helter-skelter in every direction.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Hiller jumped up with a little scream, and shook her dress violently, inspected every flounce, lest the flutings might harbor a live coal or spark.
</p>
<p>
"All safe, fortunately," she congratulated herself, after brushing off rug and fender, and pushing her chair a few paces further from the hearth. "It is a real calamity to scorch a dress in this day, when one pays so much for having it made. Our bills are absolutely shameful. Whoever loses money, or fails to make it, the milliners and dressmakers ought to be fat and flourishing. Their profits must be enormous, yet all of them-the competent and obliging ones-are overrun with work. Madame Champe, for example, gives herself the airs of a queen dispensing favors, when she consents to undertake a dress for me."
</p>
<p>
At that instant, with that tart speech, Mrs. Hiller reached land and beached her boat.
</p>
<p>
The three girls did not return home from the party to which they had gone until twelve o'clock. The rain
<pb n="414" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=426"/>
had not touched them in the close coach their father always hired for them on such occasions. Tossing off their wrappings as they ran, they trooped into their mother's sitting-room, adjoining her chamber, where she awaited them.
</p>
<p>
"With such a super<emph rend="italic">lu</emph>gious home-sy fire! bright and warm as her own heart," chattered Blanche, the young-est, rushing forward to throw herself on the rug at her mother's knee. "And a heavenly cup of tea! I enter now into the full comprehension of the reason why it is called the celestial herb," sniffing the air. "There never was, there never will be, there never 
<emph rend="italic">could</emph> be, such another mamma."
</p>
<p>
"You are right there!" cried the others, kissing her less noisily, but as fondly, as did the madcap of the flock.
</p>
<p>
Any mother might be proud of the trio, clustered about her, sipping the tea they declared to be more delicious than all the delicacies of the supper table; talking as fast as their nimble tongues could move of what they had done, and seen, and heard, since she had superintended their toilets, four hours before. That the understanding between her and them was per-fect, hearty, and joyous, was plain.
</p>
<p>
Emma, the eldest, was twenty-one, tall, shapely, with a complexion and gait that bespoke healthy nervous organization, a sound mind and judgment. Her excellent sense and happy temper made her a safe counsellor, as well as agreeable companion, for her more volatile sisters. She dressed tastefully, as did they all; moved with composed grace through a systematic round of daily duties; was her father's pride, the
<pb n="415" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=427"/>
mother's helper, and not a whit less popular in her circle than if she had been both wit and beauty, whereas she was neither.
</p>
<p>
Imogen was far handsome, a decided blonde, while Emma had gray eyes and dark hair. The second daughter liked to set off her fairness by all justifiable and lady-like appliances of art and fashion, and knew how to do it. She was never florid or conspicuous in appearance, yet never 
<emph rend="italic">en d&#233;shabille</emph> in the simplest attire. Her clothes became a part of her so soon as she put them on. A few touches of her deft fingers brought fitness out of disorder; added the nameless, inestimable air we term "style," for the want of a fitter word, to whatever she touched or wore. A very busy bee she was in her way, with a mania for reno-vating her own paraphernalia and that of everybody else who would allow her the privilege; giving to the parlors, which were her especial charge, a new aspect every day by the variety of her elegant devices.
</p>
<p>
Blanche-eighteen and just "out," was 
<emph rend="italic">petite</emph> in figure, with light, fluffy hair, dancing blue eyes and small white teeth that somehow made more arch her merry smile. She was the pet and the mischief-maker of the household, affectionate and frolicsome, with innumerable tricksy, yet dainty ways that belonged only to herself; quick of wit and fearless of tongue, and facile in hand as Imogen, her roommate and confederate in all her schemes of pleasure or work.
</p>
<p>
"Emma lays the foundation; Imogen builds there-upon. Mine is the ornamental department-the glossing over and decking, after the scaffold is down," she had once said.
</p>
<pb n="416" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=428"/>
<p>
The mother recalled it, now, watching them as with unsealed eyes, and was confirmed in the resolutions which were the fruit of her evening's musings.
</p>
<p>
"Away to bed, magpies!" she said, at length, "I won't hear a word more! You are warmed and re-freshed now. And unless you go soon, you will not be down in season to recount your adventures and conquests to papa at breakfast. He considers himself an ill-used person when he has to go off without getting the evening's report. Moreover, I want you to have your brains steady and clear, for I must have a long business talk with you to-morrow forenoon."
</p>
<p>
"Business! that sounds portentous," said Imogen, in affected consternation.
</p>
<p>
"It sounds entrancing!" commented Blanche. It savoreth of new dresses, and, perchance, jewelry-per-adventure, though 
<emph rend="italic">that</emph> is a bold flight of fancy, of a trip across the sea next summer."
</p>
<p>
"Nothing has gone wrong, I hope, mother?" queried Emma.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing at all, my dear Lady Thoughtful," was the smiling reply.
</p>
<p>
"Dear Lady Owl, you mean!" cried saucy Blanche, and she went off singing:- " And what says the old gray owl? To who? To who?"
</p>
<p>
"Happy children!" Mrs. Hiller heaved a confidential sigh to the fire that had shone on the young faces a moment ago. "Will what I have to tell them make them less happy or gay? Is mine, after all, the needless croak of the owl instead of a wise warning?"
</p>
<pb n="417" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=429"/>
<p>
The thought pierced her again, next day, when they met in her boudoir, eagerer and curious, their eyes and cheeks unmarred by the moderate dissipation of the preceding night. But she stood fast to her purpose; unfolded her scheme in bulk and detail, with the assured tone of one who had considered the cost to the last farthing. She was not accounted an eccentric woman by her acquaintances, but her proposal was novel, and, to her listeners, startling. Their days of school-study were over, she reminded them. It was time that upon the foundation of general information thus laid should be erected the superstructure of a profession.
</p>
<p>
"A specialty, if you prefer the word," she said; "since I earnestly hope you will not be called upon to practice it for a livelihood. "While papa's strength and health last, he finds no more delightful use for his earnings than to purchase comfort and luxury for us. Were he to die, or to be unfortunate in business, or become incurably diseased-and such things are of almost daily occurrence-our style of living would be at once and entirely altered. You would be driven to the study of small, minute economies and false appearances, such as must rasp and narrow the souls of those who resort to them; to escape these by a marriage of convenience, or the lucky accident of a love-match, or to engage, in earnest, in some business that would, thanks to your previous training, continue to you the elegancies, with the decencies of life."
</p>
<p>
This was the preamble to an abstract of the conversation with her husband, the troubled reverie and calculations that succeeded it. 
</p>
<p>
"Of artists in music and painting, there are, perhaps,
<pb n="418" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=430"/>
twenty in this city," she observed. "Of pretenders and drudges in these arts, there are more than a thousand. Since not one of you has developed any decided talent for such pursuits, or for literature, and, since teaching for a living has become but another name for bondage and starvation, my plan is this: You, Emma, shall learn bookkeeping; Imogen, dressmaking; Blanche, millinery. Don't look horrified! I shall not expose you to the uncongenial associations or unwholesome atmosphere of the crowded shop or work-room. All that affection and money can do to make the term of your novitiate pleasant shall be done. You shall fit up the old nursery as your academy of the useful arts, if you choose to call it by so dignified a name. I shall engage competent instructors for you and pay well for the lessons. But there must be no play-work, no superficial, amateur performance on either side. When your trades are learned, I shall expect you to keep yourselves in practice, and up with the latest improvements and fashions by practice in domestic manufactures. Milliners' and dressmakers' bills shall be among the things that were. Emma shall have charge of the housekeeping accounts and papa's books. He will pay her as he would any other skilful accountant, and what you, Imogen and Blanche, shall adjudge to be a reasonable price for every dress and bonnet made for your-selves, your sister, or for me."
</p>
<p>
The, for once, dumb trio found simultaneous voice at this.
</p>
<p>
"Mamma would that be right? Would it not be an imposition?"
</p>
<p>
"It is his own proposal. We talked it all over last
<pb n="419" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=431"/>
night after he came home, and again this morning. I need not tell you that he is the best, most indulgent father that ever loved and spoiled three loving daughters. I had some difficulty in persuading him to let me try the experiment. The tears stood in his dear eyes while he debated the 
<emph rend="italic">pros</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">cons</emph> of the case. 
</p>
<p>
My bonnie bairns!' he said. 'If I could, I would be their shield always. They should never dream of privation; never ink or prick their pretty fingers except for amusement, if I were sure of ten years more of life and prosperity.'"
</p>
<p>
She stopped to steady her voice.
</p>
<p>
Imogen was crying outright; Emma's gray eyes were cloudy. Blanche broke forth, half-laughing, half-sobbing:-
</p>
<p>
"The angelic old papa! isn't he a born seraph? I would peddle rags with a lean mule, and a string of bells across the cart, to save him an hour's anxiety. I wish 
<emph rend="italic">he</emph> would wear French hats-all flowers and moon-shine! And have four every season. Would not I furnish them for nothing, kisses thrown into the bargain?" 
</p>
<p>
The others had to laugh at the vision of papa's six feet of stature, broad shoulders, strong features, and iron-gray hair crowned with a fancy hat of the prevailing mode. Mrs. Hiller went on:--
</p>
<p>
"'But,' he added, 'I will not, while I can take care of them, derive one cent's profit from their work. There is no surer way of learning how to take care of money than having money to manage. I will furnish each of the pusses with a bank-book. She shall make out quarterly bills against you, or me; deposit her gains in
<pb n="420" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=432"/>
her own name, and invest as she will. Her earnings may thus be the nest-egg of a neat little fortune. I can't imagine-I won't believe that they will ever become mercenary. But I am sick of the limpness and insipidity and general know-nothingness of the women with whom I have business dealings. 'My dear husband never suffered me to be annoyed by these matters,' says the widow, her handkerchief to her eyes. And-'If my poor papa had foreseen this day, it would have embittered his life!' sobs the interesting spinster of forty-seven, who 'hasn't an idea how to make out a checque,' and really doesn't know the difference between real and personal estate!"
</p>
<p>
"The Payne girls!" uttered Imogen and Blanche, in wicked glee, "Mamma, you 'did' Arethusa to the life."
</p>
<p>
She resumed more seriously. "Something papa heard last night caused us to lay this subject especially to heart. Doctor Jaynes says there is no doubt that Mr. Sibthorpe is threatened with softening of the brain. He has been doing extra work this winter-bookkeeping and copying in the evenings, at home, as he could pick up such jobs, to eke out his salary, and it has been too much for him. Nothing but absolute rest and freedom from care can save him. Doctor Jaynes told him so plainly, and he answered, with tears, that it was out of the question-he must die in harness. It was natural that the news should interest and sadden us."
</p>
<p>
"He has a very helpless family," remarked Emma, compassionately.
</p>
<p>
"Because so many of them-all who are grown up-are girls!" cried Blanche, impetuously. "That tells
<pb n="421" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=433"/>
the whole story. And such a pitiful disgrace, humiliating one it is! I could be ashamed of being a woman. Mrs. Sibthorpe-indeed a majority of American mothers of the genteeler sort, ought to turn pagans, and drown their baby-girls as soon as they are born. That would be better than turning them loose-great, overgrown babies, forever whining, with their fingers in their mouths, over their feebleness, and timidity, and sentimental ignorance-upon a grinning, or "groaning public!"
</p>
<p>
"But how strange that we have never taken this subject into serious consideration before," said sensible Emma. "That, other people do not, is certain. Mother, you won't mind if I ask you a question or two?"
</p>
<p>
"My precious child! as many as yon like. I wish you to state every objection frankly. Yon are of age, you know. I could not compel yon to adopt my suggestion, if I were disposed to do so. Nor will I coerce the judgment of one of you three. We must go into this enterprise heartily and all together, or not at all."
</p>
<p>
"Will not our action excite much talk when it is known, give rise to unpleasant surmises, and subject us to many impertinent inquiries?"
</p>
<p>
"Undoubtedly it will. We may as well prepare ourselves for this. And the same kind guardians of their neighbors' behavior and general interests would buzz and sting yet more industriously were one of us to sicken with small-pox, or the house to burn down tomorrow. Or, if papa were to go off in a rapid consumption, they would bewail the number of girls in our family as loudly and as delightedly as they will soon be gossiping about poor, distraught Mr. Sibthorpe,
<pb n="422" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=434"/>
and his quartette of what Blanche calls overgrown babies; would dole out to us such charity of word and deed as falls to the share of the Payne girls. My darlings, if I could tell yon how I long to see you in-dependent of such changes in fortune and fair-weather friends! each of you armed in herself to meet reverses and to defy them, with GOD's help and blessing upon those who are trying to help themselves!"
</p>
<p>
Whatever error the tender mother may have made in her calculations of what was to be risked, gained, and lost by the bold step she purposed, she had not overrated the amount and quality of gossip caused by the practical operation of her scheme. Stories, having "Mrs. Hiller's queer whim" for a starting-point, increased and multiplied, and flew over the town like thistle-down in a windy September day. The mother was a tyrant; the daughters were peculiar and strong-minded. The parents refused to maintain their off-spring because they were not sons, and had informed them of their intention to bequeath every dollar of their property to a Boys' Orphan Asylum. The off-spring disdained to be fed and clothed by the hated parents. Mr. Hiller was insolvent; Mrs. Hiller was insane; both were misers. The sisters were engaged to be married to missionaries, and were bent upon en-grafting the multifarious iniquities of the modern and Christian woman's garb upon the scantily-clothed trunk of Ashantee, or Papuyan, or Root-digger fashions.
</p>
<p>
At first our heroines were annoyed, then diverted. In less than three months they ceased to think of the babble at all, in their growing interest in their active, varied home-life.
</p>
<pb n="423" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=435"/>
<p>
Just a year from the March night on which Mrs. Hiller had used so many nautical figures in her speech and reverie, two cards were brought up to the "academy of useful arts," as the fair students therein persisted in calling a large room at the back of the house. It was airy and sunny, and, to-day, was full of life and enjoyment, for mother and daughters were gathered there, and the chirping was like that of a happily-crowded robin's nest.
</p>
<p>
"The ladies say, 
<emph rend="italic">do</emph> let 'em run right up, without ceremony," reported the servant.
</p>
<p>
"'Arethnsa Payne,' and 'Marietta Sibthorpe,'" read Blanche from the cards. "Ask them to walk up to the work-room, Jane. Mind that yon say 'the work-room.' " As the amused girl left the chamber, the young lady continued: "An Inspection Committee! Let them come! "Won't I make them open their eyes, though ?"
</p>
<p>
"I had no idea you were engaged with a dressmaker. I am afraid we intrude," simpered Miss Payne, tip-toeing, like a cautious hen, between Blanche's work-stand, piled with bonnet frames and linings, and Imogen's, down which flowed a river of silken flounces, half gathered at the top; noting likewise, by turning her sharp face to the right, then the left, as she stepped (still like an inquisitive Partlet), that Emma's tail desk, with a ledger open upon it, was in a comer.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Hiller was ripping up a black silk dress, Emma was pulling a velvet hat to pieces.
</p>
<p>
"Only practising our trades a little in furbishing up, things; giving a spring-ish looks to hats and gowns," rejoined Blanche, with saucy politeness. "One gets so sick of winter clothes!"
</p>
<pb n="424" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=436"/>
<p>
"Dear me, how convenient! What a source of amusement it must be to have that sort of knack!" said Miss Sibthorpe, self-compassionately. "It is a genuine talent, isn't it now? downright genius! And can you actually 
<emph rend="italic">make</emph> a hat, Blanche! I couldn't put a bit of ribbon on mine to save my life!"
</p>
<p>
"But we are professionals," put in Imogen. "You have no idea how we have worked to acquire the artistic touch. "We had Miss Tiptop's forewoman with us at the country cottage we rented last summer, all the "dull season," on purpose to teach me dressmaking, besides the lessons I had had in town. Blanche ran down to the city every week for an all-day lesson."
</p>
<p>
"But how very odd!" ejaculated Arethusa.
</p>
<p>
"That people should pay such exorbitant milliners' bills all their lives, when they could learn the business with one-fourth the labor and in one-tenth of the time music requires?" Blanche said, in wilful misunderstanding, setting her head on one side, and holding her unfinished hat off at arm's length to examine the effect. uIt is queer, as you say. I'll be generous, girls. I'll 
<emph rend="italic">give</emph> you instructions, if yon wish-take you as my apprentices. I should enjoy it hugely."
</p>
<p>
Both laughed shrilly and affectedly, to disguise the offence her proposal gave them.
</p>
<p>
"I haven't the least taste for such employment," said Arethusa.
</p>
<p>
"You are very kind, but my social engagements are 
<emph rend="italic">so</emph> numerous!" pleaded Marietta. "Honestly, what do yon do it for?" You can't really like it! It seems so-so-very peculiar! such a queer whim, you know!"
</p>
<p>
"That is just what everybody says-such a queer
<pb n="425" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=437"/>
whim! You get so much talked about, you know," subjoined Arethusa. "And it is so excessively disagree-able to be talked about! I couldn't stand it."
</p>
<p>
"But you do not understand," pursued Blanche, solemnly, "that you might make a living by it. "Why, we three expect to be a rich firm in the course of time; to buy up bank stock and railway shares, and speculate in real estate, and all that. Emma is a capital book-keeper. Papa says she could command a salary of a thousand dollars a year already. Then, think of the luxury of having a new dress, or, what is the same thing, one that is made over to look like new, at every party; and as many hats a season as you want, for what it would cost to buy one at Madame Lavigne's. And finally, you see, one respects herself so thoroughly and deliciously for being able to fill up a real place-a worker's place-in the world. Most women remind me of marbles that have rolled somehow into holes. Sometimes it is a fit. But as often as not the marble is round, and the hole is square!"

<p>
"ALL aboard!"
</p>
<p>
As the cars glided out of the lighted depot into the darker streets, leading to the utter gloom of the open country, two gentlemen settled themselves into their seats with audible sighs of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
"Homeward bound!" said the elder, a man of fifty,
<pb n="426" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=438"/>
hale in figure and face, although his hair was almost white.
</p>
<p>
"For which let us be thankful!" responded his companion, heartily. "This has been a long week to me, although a busy one-longer than a fortnight would have been at home."
</p>
<p>
"You may blame the twin babies for that," said the other, smiling indulgently at his impatience.
</p>
<p>
"<emph rend="italic">Bless</emph> them for it, you mean-the boys and their mother. A man may well be impatient to get back to such treasures as are mine."
</p>
<p>
He was a fine-looking fellow, manly in every gesture and tone, six-and-twenty years old, the son-in-law of the gentleman beside him, and had been for a year his law-partner.
</p>
<p>
"You are right. Emma is a good girl-a noble woman; her mother's own daughter for sense, discretion, and warmth of heart. There is nothing frivolous or shallow about her. Let me see-the boys are almost three months old, are they not?"
</p>
<p>
"Just three months tomorrow. It is marvellous what strength the thought of them puts into my heart and arm. The cunning little rascals! Emma writes that they grow every day. She is sure they will recognise me on my return. I suppose you experienced papas, who have outlived the novelty of this sort of thing, amuse yourselves vastly at our expense; but it pleases me to believe what she says. They are very bright, healthy in mind and body, as the children of such a mother should be. They and I are blest beyond comparison in having her for the angel in our house. Should it please GOD to spare our lives"-
</p>
<pb n="427" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=439"/>
<p>
The sentence rested on the shocked air, incomplete, never to be finished. One terrific jar!-a crashing and splintering, and reeling, an awful sense of falling down, down, through utter darkness, over and over, then a blow that ended everything-surprise, consternation, fearful questioning-in blank, black silence.
</p>
<p>
When the debris of the telescoped cars was cleared away, the two men were found lying, as they had sat, side by side. The younger was dead. The elder moved and groaned as he was lifted from the wreck. Papers upon their persons established their identity beyond a doubt.
</p>
<p>
Early next morning a telegram was brought into a pretty dressing-room, where the sunshine, peering through the vine-leaves about the window, made dancing shadows on the floor, laughed, and leaped, and flashed in reflection from the water in a China bath, set in the middle of the chamber. In this splashed and crowed two baby-boys, one held by the mother, the other by the grandmother, and between, these knelt two younger women-all four in delighted worship of the tiny cherubs. There was a breathless hush as the youngest of the party sprang up to seize the envelope, and tore it open.
</p>
<p>
"<emph rend="italic">Collision!</emph>" said the missive. 
<emph rend="italic">"Frederick Cor-win killed instantly, Philip Hiller badly injured. Both will be sent on in next train."</emph>
</p>
<p>
In this ghastly shape came disaster to the long-exempt household. Life and the world had dealt so be-nignly and bountifully with them heretofore, that they had insensibly learned to look upon their possession of health, love, and happiness as assured for years and years to come. Emma's marriage had removed her from them
<pb n="428" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=440"/>
but a couple of blocks, and all concurred in the opinion that this was a charming variety upon their former estate.
</p>
<p>
"How did we ever get along without Fred's and Emma's house to run into? It is as good as having two homes," the girls often said among themselves.
</p>
<p>
When the twins came-bouncing, healthy boys-the excitement and joy in one house equalled that in the other. It seemed now, indeed, that they could ask nothing more of Heaven; that the brimming cup of bliss was mantled all over with rose-leaves. And when "Papa and Fred" were obliged to be absent from their homes for a week, in attendance upon the doings of a court a hundred miles away, Emma and her babes were transferred with much ceremony and rejoicing to her mother's care; given up to the petting and admiration of the doating aunties without reservation, beyond Fred's earnest entreaty that they would not kiss the boys away to skeletons before he returned, and a threat to have them protected by copper sheathing from the fate of St. Peter's brazen toe.
</p>
<p>
Dear Fred! the merry, handsome, stalwart brother; their only one,-who was never to jest with them again; never again to hold wife and babes in his embrace. Imogen and Blanche mourned for him only less passionately than did she who had proudly and gladly borne his name. Poor wife! she was denied the satisfaction of hearing that her name had been the last in his thoughts and speech; that the loyal heart had never beat more lovingly for her than in its latest throbbings; for weeks passed before Mr. Hiller could speak at all, and then the disjointed utterances of the palsied tongue told nothing beyond the terrible
<pb n="429" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=441"/>
fact that the brain had sustained serious, it might be irreparable, damage. A paralytic cripple he would remain until the day of his death, although this half-life might be prolonged for years, pronounced the best med-ical authorities in the land, summoned without regard to distance or expense, by the agonized wife.
</p>
<p>
Stricken, smitten of GOD, and afflicted, the four women sat them down together in the mother's room, a month after the double bereavement, and took mourn-ful but deliberate counsel together. Their affairs were not at a desperate pass, as they already knew. There was the house in which they lived, free of mortgage, which would bring at least thirty thousand dollars in the market; ten thousand dollars in bank stocks and other securities-solid, paying investments, and five thousand dollars' worth of real estate-chiefly unimproved lots in a growing part of the city, that might be very valuable in time, if they could be held and the taxes paid. Fred had invested four thousand dollars in the latter kind of property, and bis life was insured for ten thousand more. If Emma were to sell every-thing-furniture, lots and all-she would have just seventeen thousand dollars with which to support herself, to rear and educate her boys. By living upon the interest of the life-insurance fund, and paying taxes on the real-estate for some years, she might double the little fortune bequeathed to her, without reserve, by her husband's will.
</p>
<p>
"I shall not touch a cent of it, if I can help it," she said, in sad decision. "It shall be the father's provision for his sons. They will need it all, in order to educate themselves us he would have wished. For the
<pb n="430" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=442"/>
present I shall work for them and myself. You fore-saw this years ago, mother. I thank GOD, and thank you, that yon prepared us to meet it!"
</p>
<p>
"Amen!" said her sisters fervently. "Dark as is the day-so much darker than we ever dreamed it would be," added Imogen, tearfully, yet trying to smile, "we have much to be thankful for. "We are strong; we know how to work; and there are papa and the babies, darling Fred's sons, to work for."
</p>
<p>
"Papa and the babies!" Even the fond wife did not resent the classification. The hale gentleman whose half-century of honest, temperate life had not bowed his head or dimmed his eye; the sage, shrewd man of business, than whom none were more respected by his fellow-citizens, was a tremulous, timid child, who wept if his meals were delayed one minute, or his wife, his faithful, tender nurse, were out of his sight for an hour.
</p>
<p>
"Utterly incapable of attending to the simplest matters connected with his business!" cried open-eyed Everybody, hovering, harpy-like, about the human wreck. "Why, he couldn't count-one hundred to save his life. Of course, they will get a certificate of lunacy from the court, and sell the house, lots, and whatever they can realize anything upon; put all they have together, and live as prudently as possible. The girls ought to marry before long. They are pretty and popular, in spite of their little eccentricities. It isn't to be expected that they will make brilliant matches now, of course; but they must bring down their ambition to a reasonable level. Beggars mustn't be choosers. It is unfortunate that poor
<pb n="431" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=443"/>
Mrs. Corwin has those two children. But they may not live. Twins are more likely to die than other babies. And, if they 
<emph rend="italic">should</emph> be taken, she'll be likely to pick up another husband. Her little property would be a consideration to some men."
</p>
<p>
Even the true friends of the sorely-tried family wished sincerely and aloud that "each of the dear girls had a husband to take care of her;" recommended them warmly to the compassionate and favorable notice of their bachelor acquaintances, and devised pious plans of matchmaking for their relief from the inconveniences of their altered circumstances.
</p>
<p>
"The worst part of it all was that poor Emma was encumbered with the children, who would be more and more expensive every year, and that poor, dear Mr. Hiller would be a helpless imbecile all his life. And what a mistake in them to refuse to treat him as such, and have him examined by a commission who would give his family the right to dispose of his property!"
</p>
<p>
If the Ruler of the intellects and lives of men had hearkened to these benevolent economists, the crippled man and the brace of "unfortunate" infants would have been taken speedily and comfortably out of this present evil world.
</p>
<p>
"Thank heaven for the babies!" uttered Blanche, throwing her arms about Emma's waist. "You dar-ling sister! I bless you for them every hour. What should we have done through all these last fearful weeks without them-and you? Touch their weeny teenty patrimony! Indeed you shall not! And more than that, we'll make it a big one by the time they are ready to enter college."
</p>
<pb n="432" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=444"/>
<p>
The mother, as chief counsellor, had her plan ready for their consideration. The house-a large double one-was still to be occupied by them. The front parlor was to be used for the millinery department, and put entirely under Blanche's care. In the back, Imogen would hold sway; and a smaller apartment in the rear of the hall should be the fitting and trying-on chamber. The library across the hall, adjoining the dining-room, was to be the family parlor. In every other part of the house things were to remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>
"Who deserves to live more comfortably and luxuriously, to rest in soft chairs and sleep upon elastic mattresses, to have generous food served elegantly to tempt the appetite and strengthen the body, than she who purchases all these with her own toil?" said the strange logician whose daughters were too used to her "queer notions" to be startled by them. "I do not say that you will make money fast, or at once. I do contend that, saving rent, bookkeeper's and saleswoman's wages, as you will do, you ought to be able to clear your busi-ness and personal expenses the first year-if nothing more."
</p>
<p>
"If the customers come," suggested Emma.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Hiller nodded confidently. "They will come! In the beginning, out of curiosity and the love of novelty. It will depend upon your skill whether they continue their custom."
</p>
<p>
All previous sensations respecting the Hillers-their odd fancies and daring talk and levelling theories; Emma's marriage and the birth of her twins; the tragical death of her husband and Mr. Killer's deplorable condition-faded into the realms of forgottenness before
<pb n="433" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=445"/>
that excited by the appearance in all the leading papers, the following month of an advertisement to the effect that the "Misses Hiller would open on Tues-day, the 15th instant, at their father's residence on Lofty Avenue, a first-class millinery and dressmaking establishment, and pledged themselves to use their best efforts to give satisfaction to their customers."
</p>
<p>
The sudden intrusion of a bee-moth into a well-regulated, honey-lined hive might create such commotion-among the inhabitants thereof as prevailed in the "best circles" of the city when the Incredible was, at length, developed by means of printer's ink and paper, into the Certain. The Hiller philosophy had wrought its legitimate fruits, said the wise ones. Such sympathy of thought and personal history, amounting to fanatical imitation of their language and habits and mercenary views of life; such bold scoffing at the ethics and usages of SOCIETY (this in capitals half an inch long, if yon please, Mr. Printer!) could have but one sequel, and that a catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
"Be it so!" enunciated resigned Everybody, in the calm of sinless despair. "Since the Hiller girls prefer to sink to the level of mere working women; to fly in the face of Providence that would, if they were more reasonable and less sentimental, endow them with property to the amount of at least fifty thousand dollars-sixty thousand, if poor Mrs. Corwin's be included, with the certain prospect of fifteen thousand more at poor Mr. Hiller's death-if they prefer, instead of taking the goods thus offered them and living like ladies in the sphere to which they were born, faithful

to the principles that control refined SOCIETY-to delve am] plan and accumulate, let them be recognized forthwith as 
<emph rend="italic">laborers</emph>-nothing more, and nothing less! We, the loyal leaguers of SOCIETY, true to the traditions of our class and age, cannot more effectually and dignifiedly exclude them from our sacred circle; than by patronizing and 
<emph rend="italic">paying</emph> them 
<emph rend="italic">as</emph> dress-makers and milliners. They have exquisite taste. That we, being candid even where our enemies are concerned, will admit. They have also, tact and energy, and association with US in the past has given them just ideas of our style and needs. While we do not budge an inch from our belief and precept that they should have starved genteelly; lived on broad and tea, dyed and turned and otherwise rejuvenated their friends' cast-off dresses; shivered over pinched-in grates in winter and sponged upon obliging acquaintances in summer-sooner than thus degrade themselves and betray their caste for the sake of pampering their flesh with the delicacies of the markets, and their pride by indulging in purple and fine linen, in damask and cut-glass, in Brussels and satin-we "-concluded breath-less Everybody, "accept the situation as they have set it before us."
</p>
<p>
"But it is suicidal! " actually sobbed the well-wishers of the recalcitrant trio. "They 
<emph rend="italic">will never marry well now!</emph> "
</p>
<p>
"Tuesday the 15th inst." arrived-sharp but clear November weather, and the desecrated Hiller mansion wore its most cheerful aspect. In the back parlor the decks had been cleared for action, as Imogen phrased it, by removing the piano, a large sofa, and an inlaid
<pb n="435" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=447"/>
stand or two. Imogen's sewing machine and chair were by the side window. Before the embayed recess at the end of the room was a long, rather narrow table of singular construction, the plan being her own. The top was covered with enamelled leather, with morocco pouches at each corner, rather larger than the pockets of. a billiard-table, and deep drawers underneath. A tape-measure and a case of scissors lay upon this. The pictures on the walls; the carpets; the rich hangings of the windows; the lounging-chairs set invitingly about, the easel, with its collection of fine engravings in one corner, a 
<emph rend="italic">chiffonier</emph> loaded with attractive articles of virtu, and a few fresh, attractive books-even the stand of flowers in the bay-window were the same that had so often challenged the admiration of Mrs. Hiller's guests, as giving her parlors "<emph rend="italic">such</emph> an air of home-like elegance."
</p>
<p>
In Blanche's realm there had been more and material alterations. In the niches on each side of the mantel were tall, shallow cases, with sliding glass doors. These were made of black walnut, and bright silver-plated knobs and pegs set in the back. Beneath the doors were drawers with handles of the same metal. An attractive array of bonnets and hats hung in one case; of caps, and headdresses and wreaths, bouquets, sprays of flowers in the other, these last apparently springing from a box filled with moss set in the bottom. Opposite the mock conservatory was a show-case, being a walnut table handsomely carved, with a glass box on top containing ribbons arranged with a nice regard to harmony and contrasts of colors and shades. This also had drawers beneath with silver knobs. At one of the
<pb n="436" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=448"/>
front windows stood Blanche's chair and wicker-work stand. Hanging-baskets of living flowers swung between the curtains; a mocking-bird's cage in the arch dividing the rooms.
</p>
<p>
Emma was walking slowly up and down the length of the two apartments, ready to retire, at the approach of customers, to her desk in the fitting-room. Her sisters had insisted upon her right to seclude herself front general observation.
</p>
<p>
"We don't mind being made a show of! In fact, we rather like it!" the irrepressible Blanche was saying. "But they sha'n't come to stare at, and whisper about you, Queenie!"
</p>
<p>
Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were red as the French poppied in the glass case near by. Every crimp in her blonde hair seemed to stir in the breeze of excitement that swept and swayed her merry spirit. She flitted about from Imogen's dominion to her own, altering, admiring, exclaiming, like a restless humming-bird.
</p>
<p>
"I am sorry for you, too," she ran on, "for I anticipate great fun during the next few weeks. All the calls to-day that are not prompted by curiosity, more or less ill-natured, will be of condolence. Don't I know how our dear friends will pull out eye-glass and handkerchief in the same tug. 'You poor, dear girls!' Mrs. Smith will sniff. (No matter what happens to you, whether you lose a front tooth, or your fortune, or your life, your best wishers will call you 'poor dear!') 'Now 
<emph rend="italic">do</emph> yon think-honestly, now, you know-that it was 
<emph rend="italic">really</emph> necessary for Philip Killer's daughters to take this un<emph rend="italic">pre</emph>cedented step?' "
</p>
<pb n="437" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=449"/>
<p>
"Miss Allfriend will kiss us all around, and drop a tear on each of our noses, with-'My 
<emph rend="italic">dear</emph> children! it makes my heart bleed ! And 
<emph rend="italic">how</emph> does mamma stand it? And Mrs. Williams will trot in, eye-glass up-'Bless me! bless me! I thought I should drop when I read it in the papers! Such a shock! You can't really conceive! Bromide and red lavender all night, my dear! I assure you!"
</p>
<p>
"Hold your saucy tongue!" laughed Imogen, in spite of herself, and even Emma smiled at the spirited mimicry.
</p>
<p>
Blanche rattled away faster than ever. "I am going to be prim and proper when they begin to come! One and all will criticise our appointments as 'shockingly extravagant;' declare that 'the like was never seen before in store or work-room-quite out of keeping, you know!' and prophesy swift ruin if we keep on as we have begun. And we won't hint that we paid for everything, our very own selves, with the money papa has forced upon us for the work we have done in the last four years. It's none of their business! nor that we have some left, to repair losses, should we have any!"
</p>
<p>
"Dear papa! all we can do won't bring back health and reason to him!" sighed Emma. "Or life to "-
</p>
<p>
Her eyes filled suddenly, and she would have hastened from the room, but Imogen caught her in her arms.
</p>
<p>
"For 
<emph rend="italic">their</emph> sakes-those who loved and believed in us-and for the babies; we will acquit ourselves bravely, sister. There are times when work that we must do-systematic and sustained effort for others, is GOD'S best cure for soul-morbidness. 
<emph rend="italic">I</emph> know!"
</p>
<pb n="438" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=450"/>
<p>
The others exchanged a silent look over the bright head bowed on Emma's shoulder-a glance of blended pity and indignation. Then, Blanche pulled back the glass door of her flower ease with needless rattle, and busied herself with a pendant of glossy ivy.
</p>
<p>
"Another year I will devise some such plan as this for showing off my feathers-something like an aviary -see if I don't!"
</p>
<p>
Not one of the three ever referred, in so many words, to the fact that handsome, accomplished Harding Wal-ford had not entered the house in more than a month; that his visits had slackened perceptibly in frequency and length since it became generally known that Mr. Hiller would never recover. He had been Imogen's most devoted attendant for almost a year. Her family had not doubted what would be her answer to the declaration they saw was pending. The world reported that he had broken a positive engagement, and ran no risk in so doing, since she had neither father nor brother to defend her rights. But there was not, on this account, meted out to him a formidable share of censure. He was "the best judge of his own affairs." He was not rich. Had he been, he might still, with reason, hesitate to take a step that would entail upon him such a weight of responsibility as would a connection with the no longer prosperous Hillers, even had not Imogen's eccentric conduct of late, in banding with her sisters "to undermine the distinctions of SOCIETY," been ample excuse for his defection. He was wise in his generation, and the applause showered upon him who doeth good unto himself, was his due. SOCIETY always pays this sort of debt.
</p>
<pb n="439" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=451"/>
<p>
Only-Imogen had believed in him; and the slavering of her trust beyond the hope of repair, was very hard to bear. So much more cruel than the thought of being the target of gossip's shafts, that the latter rattled unheeded against her armor of proud rectitude that day, and ever afterward. Desertion had stung its worst when the man she loved had looked for the last time, with love-full eyes, into hers.
</p>
<p>
Customers did come; singly, in twos and threes, and, a little past midday, when they had discussed the Hillers' affairs comfortably over their luncheon-tables, in droves. They gathered in the spacious rooms, as Mrs. Hiller had predicted, not so much to buy or order, as to criticise and wonder. The most comic part of the exhibition to fun-loving, dauntless Blanche was that so many were disconcerted at finding that they were not singular in their curiosity and the, resolve to gratify it. Hardly second to this was the ludicrous uncertainty on the part of most of the visitors as to the proper line of conduct to be pursued in greeting the gentlewomen so abruptly transformed into trades-people whom they were here to scrutinize. That the cordial yet respectful familiarity of equals was not to be thought of, now, was the dominant impression with the majority. Yet few were so indurated in worldliness, or so barefaced in the display of it as to attempt to treat their late social compeers exactly as they would "quite common persons." The result was a combination of stiffness and patronage totally at variance with the carriage of well-bred ease, flavored with hauteur, they adjudged to be "the thing in the circumstances."
</p>
<pb n="440" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=452"/>
<p>
The proprietors of the elegant apartments were mistresses of themselves and the position from the beginning. With a single eye to business, they adroitly evaded all allusion to the novelty of the scene; received the compliments to their establishments and their wares with smiling composure; showed the stock and took orders with professional dexterity, and entirely ignored glances and veiled hints of commiseration.
</p>
<p>
"Have you 
<emph rend="italic">no</emph> assistants?" queried more than one.
</p>
<p>
"At present, none," Imogen returned, quietly. "Should our business require it, we shall procure help, keeping everything, of course, under our own personal supervision."
</p>
<p>
"It is not an untried field to us, you know," sub-joined Blanche, in her blithest tone. "Much practice has taught us swiftness and the artistic sleight of hand that distinguishes the work of the 
<emph rend="italic">modiste</emph> from that of the amateur."
</p>
<p>
The rooms were quite full when a plain but handsome carriage stopped at the door. A lady alighted with her arms full of bundles, followed by two slender girls of eighteen and twenty, each with a parcel, although the footman stood idly by, holding the door.
</p>
<p>
"Just like her!" murmured a spectator inside the front window, peeping through the lace curtains. "She prides herself on her want of what she calls false shame, and on being able to wait on herself."
</p>
<p>
A hum ran from the tattler through the little assembly. Blanche, who was showing a box of feathers to a customer, feigned not to hear it; dared not to steal a look at her sister, although she longed to know how she comported
<pb n="441" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=453"/>
herself in view of the approaching ordeal. She was the only one present whose eyes were not directed instantly toward the young dressmaker as she advanced a few steps to meet the new arrivals. Foremost in the group was the mistress of the carriage, a stately figure, richly attired, who wore her own gray hair folded smoothly above a pair of black brows and searching, usually severe eyes. They softened and shone at sight of the form in deep mourning, awaiting her pleasure, perhaps reading through the guise of lady-like self-possession the secret trouble that fluttered heart and pulse, while the trained features served the resolute will faithfully.
</p>
<p>
"My dear child!" she said, impulsively, holding fast to her parcels, but bending to kiss the cheek which flushed high under the salute."
</p>
<p>
Her daughters pressed forward to bestow caresses as affectionate upon "dear Imogen," the family having recently returned from abroad. Their mother allowed them no time for inquiries or condolence.
</p>
<p>
"I am very, very glad to see yon looking so well and bright!" she pursued, in a breezy, cheerful tone, neither shrill nor loud, but one that could make itself heard whenever and by whomsoever she willed. "I didn't mean that my first call should be one of business, but I suppose you wouldn't admit me upon any other plea, in business hours. But there's the great Huntley wedding, week after next, you know, and the girls haven't enough finery to warrant their appearance there-just from Paris, too! So we have come to cast ourselves upon your generosity and beg you, for the sake of old limes and present friendship, to make us
<pb n="442" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=454"/>
presentable. Unless you arc too severely taxed already by the importunate friends of whom I see so many present. How is the dear father to-day? You must let me see him and mamma before I leave-and Emma and the babies! You mustn't exclude us from the other parts of the house because yon have taken to practicalities in sober, serious earnest. We would rebel outright, and 
<emph rend="italic">en masse</emph>-after having been welcomed, during so many years, to the pleasantest home in the city!"
</p>
<p>
Imogen had led the way into the other parlor while the lady talked, and was now undoing the wrappings of the three silk dresses, and opening boxes of rare, fine lace on the long table. Her back was to the groups of attentive listeners to the foregoing monologue, and the keen eyes beside her saw her fingers, shake, the long, brown lashes fall quickly to hide the unshed tears.
</p>
<p>
"You are 
<emph rend="italic">very</emph> good!" said a gentle, grateful voice. "But I felt sure you would be!"
</p>
<p>
"My love!" A strong and not small hand-ungloved-a superb diamond 
<emph rend="italic">solitaire</emph>, in itself a fortune, flashing on it as the guard to a worn wedding-ring- covered the chill, uncertain fingers, busy with paper and twine. Imogen felt the warmth and thrill of the pressure to her very heart. "If you ever dare to say another word like that, I'll never forgive you! Trimmings, style, everything-we leave to yon, Imogen, my dear!" she continued, aloud. If you can make my girls half as 
<emph rend="italic">distingu&#233;</emph> as yon are yourself in full dress, or home-dress either, for that matter, I shall be satisfied. I always told yon you were a genius in your profession
<pb n="443" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=455"/>
-creative, not merely imitative genius. It was a shame that you did not give others the benefit of it before now. It is refreshing to one who has cultivated any taste for the aisthetic, to look about your rooms. I have lively hopes that dress may be understood and studied as one of the fine arts among us in time. You will be known in this generation and region, at least, as a benefactress. We go into another room to be measured, did yon say?"
</p>
<p>
She swept her daughters before her into the fitting-room, and a buzz and rustle succeeded the silence her entrance had caused.
</p>
<p>
In Blanche's hearing no one could comment openly upon what had passed. But there were significant whispers and wondering looks, and by the time the gossips reached the street, much and prolonged discussion with regard to this episode in the history of " opening day."
</p>
<p>
For the eccentric old lady who could afford to defy the dictate of SOCIETY, and exercised her right., was Mrs. Horatio Harding, whose own veins were full of old, rich Dutch blood, and whose husband was a merchant prince, and Mr. Harding Watford was her nephew-in-law. If she had set her mind upon making the Hiller girls the fashion, she had carried her point triumphantly. With a sort of insolent grace, perhaps, at which people grumbled while they obeyed her, but she had had her way, as usual. Mrs. Horatio Harding had " opinions," and it was not always safe or pleasant to oppose her.
</p>
<p>
"You may not know that yon have done us a great service-one for which we can never pay you aright,"
<pb n="444" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=456"/>
said Imogen to her at the close of "the season's" work. "But you have! That we have succeeded beyond our most sanguine expectations is due, in a large measure, to the foothold yon gave us that first day. If other women who have as much influence would use it to free, not enslave, their sex; to overcome, instead of strengthening the prejudices that bear so hardly upon us already, what a change would be wrought in homes where the few strive and toil, and the many are served!"
</p>
<p>
The strong white hand with the glittering 
<emph rend="italic">solitaire</emph>, was raised threateningly.
</p>
<p>
"What did I tell you? I will not be praised for doing a simple act of justice, especially when my heart, as well as my conscience, moved me to it. And 
<emph rend="italic">you</emph>, my sweet child, may not know that you have had a narrow escape from marrying a man who has proved himself no more worthy to mate with you than am I with one of the holy men of old-these of whom the world was not worthy. But you have. That is all shall ever 
<emph rend="italic">say</emph> on the subject. But I think the more for my reserve when with you. And Harding Walfard knows that I do. I am not reticent in his hearing. Don't attempt to defend him! He has lost 
<emph rend="italic">you</emph>, and that ought to be punishment enough for one who is capable of appreciating you. Not that be ever was."
</p>
<p>
"I don't want him to be punished, dear Mrs. Harding," replied Imogen, gently, "He only swam with the tide."
</p>
<p>
"Precisely! and to deserve such a wife as yon would make, a man ought to be strong of soul and right of purpose. Don't talk to me about moral cowards! I think 1 was burn hating them? "

Two years later, this steady friend dropped in to see the sisters on a gloomy afternoon in February. The light from the front windows made long, clean cuts in the clinging yellow fog without, across the rimy pavement to the carriage, with its liveried coachman and fine horses. Passers-by, on their way to humble homes lifted eyelids beaded with the icy damp, and thought how lucky were the dwellers in the stately house; how much-to-be envied the guest who rode in state above the mire of the common ways. Those who recognized the liveries, and knew whose was the dwelling, pondered, more or less wonderingly, upon the incongruity of the unabated intimacy, and speculated, perhaps, upon the probabilities that the Harding pride would have revolted at a matrimonial alliance between a scion of their house and one of the "reduced" family, for all Mrs. Horatio's show of friendship. It was a lucky thing, decided eight out of fen of those who considered the matter, that young "Walford had not committed himself irrevocably before the "misfortune" that showed him how near he was to the edge of the abyss. He had made a desirable match last fall, and was now travelling in Europe with his heiress bride.
</p>
<p>
Little cared guest or hostesses what the outside world thought or believed respecting their intercourse. Emma's hoys were building block houses on the hack parlor floor. The three sisters wore gathered about the centretable in the other room, talking in low voices over their work. Mrs, Harding stopped in the doorway on seeing their grave faces, and that they were making black 
<emph rend="italic">cr&#234;pe</emph> bonnets.
</p>
<pb n="446" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=458"/>
<p>
"A mourning order!" she said, in her unceremonious Way. "Anybody that I know?"
</p>
<p>
"Not an order exactly," explained Imogen, when they had welcomed her. "But poor Mr. Sibthorpe has gone at last, and Blanche proposed that we should spare the widow and three unmarried daughters the expense of bonnets and veils; so we are making them and the widow's caps out of work hours. We do our charity work at such odd times you know-and together.
</p>
<p>
"Yon are the Blessed Three Sisters-<emph rend="italic">that</emph> everybody knows!" uttered the visitor. "I don't believe I 
<emph rend="italic">could</emph> set a stitch fur that tribe of lazy locusts! Amelia, the manrried one, is no better. Her husband failed awhile; ago, as yon may remember, and she is too proud to help him in the small haberdasher's shop he has lately set up; sits at home like a-I won't say lady-but an idiotic automaton-"
</p>
<p>
"Who ever heard of an intellectual one? " laughed Blanche.
</p>
<p>
"No pertness, miss! I don't pick my terms when I am excited. She sits in the small parlor over the store, as I was saying, and curries favor with wealthy and charitable ladies by cutting sponge and velvet into monkey and black-and-tan terrier pen-wipers for fancy fairs. What are the Sibthorpe's going to do, now that the man they murdered among them is dead?"
</p>
<p>
"His life was insured "-began Emma.
</p>
<p>
"Humph!" interrupted, Mrs. Harding. "You needn't proceed. They will eat the insurance up to the last dollar, and by that time the boys will be big enough to divide the women among them; to carry
<pb n="447" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=459"/>
them bodily-their expenses, that is-as we see ants running about with egg saes bigger than themselves on their shoulders. I know the old, hideous story by heart. Drop the subject."
</p>
<p>
"Let me give you a piece of news that will entertain you better," said Blanche, merrily. "One of the Payne girls-Sophia, the youngest-is going to marry a widower with eight children-all at home."
</p>
<p>
"Serves her right! But I am sorry for the children. Go on!"
</p>
<p>
"The happy man is a Mr. Gregorias, of Spanish extraction. He is small and withered, and reported to be rich as cream. So Arethusa says. The wedding dress is to be of white satin, with point lace veil and flounces-the gift of the groom."
</p>
<p>
"Have yon undertaken the trousseau?" queried Mrs.. Harding, fixing her keen gaze upon Imogen.
</p>
<p>
"No," she answered, coloring as she smiled. "I have declined making any engagements for the spring. I am going abroad for a year in May, and Blanche does not want a stranger here in my place."
</p>
<p>
"Harkham Burke 
<emph rend="italic">is</emph> the man. then! My love ! I congratulate yon with all my heart. I have been on thorns all winter about yon and the noble fellow. I was afraid you had some Quixotic notions that would stand in the way of his happiness and yours."
</p>
<p>
"No; why should I have?" rejoined the: 
<emph rend="italic">fianc&#233;e</emph>, speaking quietly and sensibly. "We are not vowed to our trades, or to celibacy. Markham says there is no need that he, with his ample means:, should let me keep up my business. Whatever 1 have made, he insists upon settling upon me. He would have had me divide
<pb n="448" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=460"/>
it all between Blanche and Emma, but they would not allow it."
</p>
<p>
" I should hope not! " cried Blanche, energetically. 'Two women who can bike care of themselves!'"
</p>
<p>
"Blanche will eularge her department," continued Imogen, " now that I will leave her room. You should hear her plans of making a temple of art-not of fashion alone-in these two parlors. It will be very beautiful. She can afford to indulge her taste in these respects. She is making money."
</p>
<p>
" Means to be a nabob-ess before she dies--or marries," interjected the youngest sister.
</p>
<p>
"You are a mercenary witch," said Mrs. Harding. " Emma, Mr. Harding says your lots are rising in value fast, and the price of land in that quarter of the city is sure to increase with tenfold rapidity during the next dozen years. He would not advise you to close with the offer made you last week, unless you need the money."
</p>
<p>
" Thank yon and him ! " replied the young widow. " I am not anxious to sell. Let it grow for the boys. It belongs to them. The rest of us are provided for. Even for mamma there is enough and to spare. "We have never been tempted by the various straits of poverty and shabby gentility to wish for our father's death, that we might profit by 
<emph rend="italic">his</emph> life-insurance policy. Feeble as he is, his cheerfulness, his patience and affection for us all, make his a very bright presence in our home. It is a priceless comfort to us all that he is not compelled, when he needs them most, to relinquish the home and luxuries he toiled so long and bravely to obtain for us."
</p>
<pb n="449" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=brkf&#38;PageNum=461"/>
<p>
" Yon can't imagine what pride and delight he takes in the boys!" exclaimed Blanche. "We really hope he may live to see them grown."
</p>
<p>
"It is the story of the old storks and their young, to the life," said Mrs. Harding to her husband that night. " I used to think it a fable. I believe now that it is true, out and out!"

"The very best, the most sensible, the most practical, the most honest book on this matter of getting up good dinners, and living in a decent Christian way, that has yet found its way in our household."--<emph rend="italic">Watchman and Reflector.</emph>

SEE WHAT THE CRITICS, AND PRACTICAL HOUSEKEEPERS, say of it:
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"And now we have from another popular novelist a cookery book, whereof our house keeper {this literary recorder is not a bachelor) speaks most enthusiastically. She says that simplicity and clearness of expression, accuracy of detail, a regard to economy of material, and certainty of good results, are requisites in a useful receipt-book for the kitchen, and Marion Harland has comprehended all these. That she has by experience proved the unsatisfactoriness of housekeepers' helps in general is shown by the arrange-ment of her book. She has appended a star to such recipes as, after having tried them herself, she can recommend as safe and generally simple. Such a directory will be a great help to one who goes to the book for aid in preparing a pleasant and savory meal without much experience in cooking. The language is so simple, and the directions so plain, that a reasonably intelligent cook might avail herself of it to vary her manner of preparing even ordinary dishes. The introduction to the book should be printed as a tract and put in every house. The simple advice for the management of servants, the general directions at the head of each department of cooking, and the excellent pages on the sick-room, make as complete an aid to housekeepers as can well be desired."--<emph rend="italic">Harper's Monthly.</emph>
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"In the hands of the author, whose name is well known in another department of literature, the subject has been treated with thoroughness and skill, showing that a little common sense may be as successful in the concoction of a toothsome viand as in the composition of a romance."--<emph rend="italic">N.Y. Daily Tribune.</emph>
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"It inspires us with a great respect for the housewifery of a literary lady, and we cannot err in predicting for it a wide popularity."--<emph rend="italic">N.Y. Evening Post.</emph>
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"Unites the merits of a trustworthy receipt-book with the freshness of a familial talk on household affairs."--<emph rend="italic">Albany Evening Journal.</emph>
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"The directions arc clear, practical, and so good in their way that the only wonder is, bow any one head could hold so many pots, kettles, and pans, and such a world of gastronomic good things."--<emph rend="italic">Hearth and Home.</emph>
</p>
<p size="smaller">
"The recipes are clearly expressed, easy to follow, and not at all expensive. The suggestions about household affairs are 
<emph rend="italic">chic.</emph> On a test comparison with three other American cook-books, it comes out ahead upon every count. Beyond this 
<emph rend="italic">experto credo</emph> nothing more need be said."--<emph rend="italic">Christian Union.</emph>

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">THE BRIC-A-BRAC SERIES. Personal Reminiscences of Famous Poets and Novelists, Wits and Humorists, Artists, Actors, Musicians, and the like. EDITED BY RICHARD HENRY STODDARD.</hd>
<p size="smaller">
<emph rend="italic">The volumes already issued have insured the Bric-a-Brac Series wide and permanent popularity. It is the aim to gather up in this collection, from the numerous biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs that have lately appeared, all the reminiscences worth preservation of the men and women who have done so much to make this century one of the most brilliant in the annals of English Literature. Occasionally, too, place will be found in the volumes for some of the more notable papers regarding distinguished men and women, which form so important a part of the magazine literature of the day. Each volume will be complete in itself. A careful index will furnish a ready guide to the contents of the different volumes, in which, under the capable editorship of MR. R. H. STODDARD, it may safely be asserted there will be brought together a fund of choice and fresh anecdote and gossip, enough not only to justify the general title of the Series, but the line of Marlowe which has been selected as its motto, "Infinite riches in a little room."</emph>
