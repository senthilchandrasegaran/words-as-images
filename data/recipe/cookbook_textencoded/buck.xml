<div type="preface"><pb n="preface" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=12"/><hd align="center" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd><p>IT is becoming fashionable in these pinching times to economize, and housekeepers are really finding it a pleasant pastime to search out and stop wastes in household expenses, and to exercise the thousand little economies which thoughtful and careful women understand so readily and practice with such grace. Somebody has said that a well-to-do French family would live on what an American household in the same condition of life wastes, and this may not be a great exaggeration. Here, the greatest source of waste is in the blunders and experiments of the inexperienced. Women are slow to learn by the experience of others. Every young house-keeper must begin at the beginning (unless her mother was wise enough to give her a careful training) and blunder into a knowledge of the practical duties of the household, wasting time, temper and money in mistakes, when such simple instructions as any skillful housewife might readily give, would be an almost perfect guide. Lately there have been attempts to gather such instructions as are needed into a book, but they have been partial failures, because the authors have been good book-makers, but poor bread-makers, or because, while practically familiar with the subjects treated, they have failed to express clearly and concisely the full processes in detail. In compiling this new candidate for favor, the one aim has been to pack between its covers the greatest possible amount of practical information of real value to all, and especially to the inexperienced. It is not a hap-hazard collection of recipes, gathere at random from doubtful sources, but has<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=13"/>been made up without sparing time, labor, or expense, from the choicest bits of the best experience of hundreds who have long traveled the daily round of household duties, not reluctantly like drudges, but lovingly, with heart and hand fully enlisted in the work. Those housewives, especially, whose purses are not over-plethoric, will, it is believed, find its pages full of timely and helpful suggestions in their efforts to make the balance of the household ledger appear on the right side, without lessening the excellence of the table or robbing home of any comfort or attraction.</p><p>The arrangement of subjects treated, whenever practicable, has been made in the simple order of the alphabet, and for the sake of still more ready reference a very full alphabetical index has been added. The instructions which precede the recipes of each department, have been carefully made up, and are entirely trustworthy, and the recipes themselves are new to print, and well indorsed. Several suggestive articles have also been introduced, which, though not belonging strictly to cookery, bear such close relations to it that the fitness of their appearance in the connection is evident.</p><p>There has been no attempt at display or effect, the only purpose being to express ideas as clearly and concisely as possible, and to make a thoroughly simple and practical work. In the effort to avoid the mistakes of others, greater errors may have been committed; but the book is submitted just as it is to the generous judgement of those who consult it, with the hope that it may lessen their perplexities; and stimulate that just pride without which work is drudgery and great excellence impossible.</p></div>

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=14"/><hd align="center" size="larger">BREAD-MAKING.</hd><p>THE old saying, "bread is the staff of life," has sound reason in it. Flour made from wheat, and meal from oats and Indian corn, are rich in the waste-repairing elements, starch and albumen, and head the list of articles of food for man. Good bread makes the homeliest meal acceptable, and the coarsest fare appetizing, while the most luxurious table is not even tolerable without it. Light, crisp rolls for breakfast, spongy, sweet bread for dinner, and flaky biscuit for supper, cover a multitude of culinary sins; and there is no one thing on which the health and comfort of a family so much depends as the quality of its home-made loaves.</p><p>Bread-making seems a simple process enough, but it requires a delicate care and watchfulness, and a thorough knowledge of all the contingencies of the process, dependent on the different qualitites of flour, the varying kinds and conditions of yeast, and the change of seasons; the process which raises bread successfully in winter making it sour in summer. There are many little things in bread-making which require accurate observation, and, while valuable recipes and well-defined methods in detail are invaluable aids, nothing but experience will secure the name merited by so few, though earnestly coveted by every practical, sensible housekeeper--"an excellent bread-maker." Three things are indispensable to success--good flour, good yeast, and watchful care. Good flour adheres to the hand, and, when pressed, shows the imprint of the lines of the skin. Its tint is cream white. Never buy that which has a blue-white tinge. Poor flour is not adhesive, can be blown about easily, and sometimes has a dingy look, as though mixed with ashes. Never use flour without sifting; and a large tin or<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=15"/>wooden pail with a tight-fitting cover, kept full of sifted flour, will be found a great convenience. All kinds of flour and meal, except buckwheat and Graham, need sifting, and all except wheat flour should be bought in small quantities, as they become damp and musty by long standing.</p>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">THE SPONGE.</purpose>
This is made from <ingredient>warm water or milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> <variation>(some add <ingredient>mashed potatoes),</ingredient></variation> mixed together in proper proportions. In summer, care must be taken not to set sponge too early, at least not before eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Make up a rather thick batter of flour and <ingredient>tepid water or milk.</ingredient> (Sponge mixed with <ingredient>bran water,</ingredient> warm in winter and cold in summer, makes sweeter bread. Boil bran in the proportion of one pint to a quart of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and strain.) <variation>When <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used, scald to prevent souring, and cool before using;</variation> add yeast, cover closely, and place to rise on the kitchen table. <variation>In very hot weather, sponge can be made with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient></variation> <variation>In winter, mix the batter with <ingredient>water or milk at blood warmth,</ingredient> testing it with the finger, and making it as warm as can be borne; stir in the flour, which will cool it sufficiently for the yeast; cover closely and place in a warm and even temperature.</variation> A good plan is to fold a clean blanket several times, and cover with it, providing the sponge is set in a very large <implement>crock</implement> or jar, so that there is no danger of its running over. As a general rule, one small tea-cup of yeast and three pints of "wetting" will make sponge enough for four ordinary loaves. In all sponges add the yeast last, making sure that it will not be scalded; when placed to rise, always cover closely. Many think it an improvement to beat the sponge thoroughly, like batter for a cake. All the various sponges are very nice baked on a griddle for breakfast-cakes, or, better still, in <implement>muffin-rings.</implement> When used in this way, add a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and make the sponge rather thick.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE GOOD BREAD.</purpose>
Always be</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">"Up in the morning early, just at the peep of day,"</p>
<p>in summer time to prevent the sponge becoming sour by too long standing, and in winter to be getting materials warmed and in readiness for use. A large, seamless tin <implement>dish-pan</implement> with handles and<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=16"/>a tight-fitting cover, kept for this purpose alone, is better than a wooden bowl for bread. It should be thoroughly washed and scalded every time it is used. Measure and sift the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> It is convenient to keep two quart cups, one for dry and the other for liquid measuring. In winter, always warm the flour and also the sponge. Put the flour in a bread-pan, make a large well in the center, into which pour the sponge, adding two level tea-spoons of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> (this is the quantity for four loaves of bread); mix well, being careful not to get the dough too stiff; turn out on the <implement>bread-board,</implement> rub the pan clean, and add the "rubbings" to the bread. Knead for fully twenty minutes, or until the dough ceases to stick to either the board or hands. The process of kneading is very important. Some good bread-makers knead with the palm of the hands until the dough is a flat cake, then fold once, repeating this operation until the dough is perfectly smooth and elastic; <variation>others close the hands and press hard and quickly into the dough with the fists, dipping them into the flour when the dough sticks, or, after kneading, chop with the <implement>chopping-knife</implement> and then knead again;</variation> <variation>others still knead with a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> thinking it a great saving of strength.</variation> No exact directions can be given, but experience and practice will prove the best guides. After the bread is thoroughly kneaded, form into a round mass or large loaf, sprinkle the bread-pan well with flour, and, having placed the loaf in it, sprinkle flour lightly on the top; cover, and set to rise in a warm temperature; let it rise well this time, say from one to two hours, owing to the season of the year. Place again on the <implement>bread-board,</implement> knead lightly with elastic movements for five minutes, again form into one large loaf, return to pan, and let rise, but not so long this time. Then knead down in the pan, cut into equal parts, place one at a time on the board, mold each into a smooth, oblong loaf, not too large, and put one after another into a well-greased <implement>baking-pan,</implement> and set to rise. Loaves made in the French style, long and narrow, are about half crust, and more easily digested, the action of heat anticipating part of the digestive process. In molding, do not leave any lumps or loose flour adhering to the outside, but mold until the loaves are perfectly smooth. No particular directions can be given in regard to the time bread should stand after it is molded and<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=17"/>placed in the pans, because here is the point where observation and discretion, are so indispensable. In hot weather, when the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is very good and the bread very light, it must not stand over fifteen minutes before placing to bake. If it is cold weather and the yeast is less active, or the bread not perfectly raised, it may sometimes stand an hour in the pans without injury. When it is risen so as to seam or crack, it is ready for the oven; if it stands after this it becomes sour, and even if it does not sour it loses its freshness and sweetness, and the bread becomes dry sooner after baking. Bread should undergo but two fermentations; the saccharine or sweet fermentation, and the vinous, when it smells something like foaming beer. The housewife who would have good, sweet bread, must never let it pass this change, because the third or acetous fermentation then takes place. This last can be remedied by adding <ingredient>soda</ingredient> in the proportion of one tea-spoon to each quart of <ingredient>wetting;</ingredient> or, which is the same thing, a tea-spoon to four quarts of flour; but the bread will be much less nutritious and healthful, and some of the best elements of the flour will be lost. Always add salt to all bread, biscuit, griddle cakes, etc., but <emph rend="italic">never</emph> salt sponge. A small quantity of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> is an improvement to all bread dough. Bread should always be mixed as <emph rend="italic">soft as it can be handled</emph>.</p></recipe>
<hd align="center">TO BAKE BREAD.</hd><p>Here is the important point, for the bread may be perfect thus far and then be spoiled in baking. No definite rules can be given that apply equally well to every stove and range; but one general rule must be observed, which is to have a steady, moderate heat, such as is more minutely described in the directions for baking large cakes. The oven must be just hot enough; if too hot, a firm crust is formed before the bread has expanded enough, and it will be heavy. Many test the oven by sprinkling a little flour on the bottom; if it browns very quickly, it is too hot, but if it browns gradually, it is just right. An oven in which the hand can not be held longer than to count twenty moderately, is hot enough. When the bread is done (to test which, break apart and press gently with the finger; if elastic it is done, but if clammy, not done; and must be returned to the oven), wrap in a coarse towel <pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=18"/>or bread cloth and place each loaf on its edge until cool. If by accident or neglect the bread is baked too hard, rub the loaves over with butter, wet the towel in which they are wrapped, and cover with another dry towel. In winter, bread dough may be kept sweet several days by placing it where it will be cold without freezing, or by putting it so deep into the <implement>flour barrel</implement> as to exclude it entirely from the air. When wanted for use, make into bread, or, by adding the proper ingredients, into cake, rusk, biscuit, apple dumplings, chicken pie, etc.</p><hd align="center">GRAHAM AND CORN BREAD.</hd><p>It is very desirable that every family should have a constant supply of bread made of unbolted flour, or rye and Indian corn. Most persons find it palatable, and it promotes health. For these coarse breads, always add a little brown sugar or molasses, and the amount given in the recipes may be increased according to taste. They rise quicker and in a less warm atmosphere than without sweetening. A little lard or butter improves bread or cakes made of Graham or Indian meal, rendering them light and tender. Graham rises rather more quickly than fine flour, and should not be allowed to rise quite as light. The fire should be steady and sufficient to complete the baking, and the oven hot when the bread is put in. A fresh blaze will burn the crust, while a steady fire will sweeten it. Graham bread bakes more slowly than fine-flour bread, and corn bread requires more time and a hotter oven than either. Use either yellow or white corn, ground coarse, for mush, and white, ground fine, for bread, etc. In cutting the latter while warm, hold the knife perpendicularly. Rye is said to absorb more moisture from the air than any other grain; hence, all bread from this meal needs a longer application of heat, and keeps moister after being baked than that made from other grain.</p>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD SPONGE AND BREAD.</purpose>
Five pints of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> five quarts of <ingredient>sifted flour,</ingredient> one coffee-cup of <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> mix in a two-gallon stone jar, cover closely, and set in a large tin pan, so that if the sponge rises over the top of the jar, the drippings may fall into the pan. Set to rise the evening before baking. In winter be careful to set in a warm place. In the morning sift six quarts of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a pail, pour the sponge into the bread-pan or bowl, add two table-spoons of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then the flour gradually; mix and knead well, using up nearly all the flour. This first kneading is the most important, and should occupy at least twenty minutes. Make the bread in one large loaf, set away in a warm place, and cover with a cloth. It ought to rise in half and hour; when it should be kneaded thoroughly again for ten minutes. Then take enough dough for three good-sized loaves (a quart bowl of dough to each), give five minutes kneading to each loaf, and place to rise in a <implement>dripping-pan</implement> well greased with <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The loaves will be light in five or ten minutes; and will bake in a properly heated oven in half an hour. Make a well in the center or the remaining dough and into it put one-half tea-cup of <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> one tea-cup of lard, and two <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> which mix thoroughly with the dough, knead into one large loaf, set in a warm place about fifteen minutes to rise, and, when light, knead five minutes and let rise again for<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=20"/>
about ten minutes, when it should be light. Take out of pan, knead on <implement>bread-board,</implement> roll about an inch in thickness, cut out with a <implement>biscuit-cutter,</implement> and place in <implement>dripping pan;</implement> let rise five minutes and bake twenty minutes. In winter more time must be allowed for rising. This makes three loaves and ninety biscuit.<contributor rend="italic">--S. A. M.</contributor></p></recipe>

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD WITH BUTTERMILK.</purpose>
The evening before baking, bring to the boiling point two quarts of <ingredient>buttermilk,</ingredient> and pour into a <implement>crock</implement> in which a scant tea-cup of sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient> has been placed. Let stand till sufficiently cool, then add half a cup of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to make a thick batter; the better and longer the sponge is stirred the whiter will be the bread. In the morning sift the flour into the bread-pan, pour the sponge in the center, stir in some of the flour, and let stand until after breakfast; then mix, kneading for about half an hour, the longer the better; when light, mold into loaves, this time kneading as little as possible. The secret of good bread is having good yeast, and not baking too hard. This makes four loaves and forty biscuit. <contributor rend="italic">--M. C. M.</contributor></p></recipe>

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BREAD WITH POTATO SPONGE.</purpose>
Pare and boil four or five <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> mash fine, and add one pint of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> pour on the mixture first <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> enough to moisten well, then about one quart of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> after which add flour enough to make a stiff batter. When cooled to "scarcely milk warm," put in one-half pint (or more will do no harm) of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and let it stand in a warm place over night; in the morning add to this sponge one cup of <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> stir in flour, and knead well. The more kneading the finer and whiter the bread will be; pounding also with a <implement>potato-masher</implement> improves the bread greatly, and is rather easier than so much kneading. When quite stiff and well worked and pounded, let it rise again, and when light, make into loaves or biscuit, adding no more flour except to flour the hands and board--merely enough to prevent the bread from sticking. Let it rise again, then bake; and immediately after taking from the oven, wrap in a wet towel until partly cold, in order to soften the crust.

glaze, brush lightly with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or the well-beaten <ingredient>yolk of an egg</ingredient> sweetened, and a little <ingredient>milk</ingredient> added.</p>
<p>Biscuit may be baked in eight minutes by making the oven as hot as can be without burning, and allowing it to cool off gradually as they bake; this makes them very light, but one has to watch closely to keep them from being scorched. Any kind of bread or pastry mixed with water requires a hotter fire than that mixed with milk.</p>
<p>Biscuit for tea at six must be molded two hours before, which will give ample time for rising and baking. Parker House rolls for breakfast at eight must be made ready at five. Many think it unnecessary to knead down either bread or biscuit as often as here directed; but if attention is given to the dough at the right time, and it is not suffered to become <emph rend="italic">too light</emph>, it will be much nicer, whiter and of a finer texture if these directions are followed.</p></recipe>

One tea-spoon soda and two of cream tartar, or three tea-spoons baking-powder, to every three pints of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> is about the right proportion. Bake in a quick oven as soon as made, and they rise more quickly if put into hot pans. Gems of all kinds require a hot oven, but the fire should be built sometimes before they are put into the oven and allowed to go down by the time they are light, as the heat necessary to raise them will burn them in baking if kept up:</p>
<p>Soda and raised biscuit and bread or cake, when stale, can be made almost as nice as fresh by plunging for an instant into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and then placing in a pan in the oven ten or fifteen minutes; thus treated they should be used immediately.</p></recipe>
<p><implement>Waffle-irons</implement> should be heated, then buttered or greased with lard, and one side filled with batter, closed and laid on the fire or placed on the stove, and after a few minutes turned on the other side.

Late in the evening make a rather stiff <ingredient>potato sponge</ingredient> (see directions under "Bread-Making"), and in the morning mix in as much <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as will make a soft dough, knead well, and place to rise; when sufficiently light, knead down again, repeating the operation two or three times, remembering not to let the dough become sour by rising too light; mold into common-sized loaves, place in your <implement>dripping-pan</implement> to rise, and bake very carefully, so as to secure the very lightest brown crust possible. On taking out of the oven, roll in a cloth tightly wrung out of water, with a large <implement>bread-blanket</implement> folded and wrapped around all. Let cool three or four hours, cut lengthwise of the loaf (not using the outside piece), first spreading lightly with good <ingredient>sweet butter,</ingredient> then cutting in slices not more than a quarter of an inch, or just as thin as possible, using for this purpose a very thin, sharp knife; lay on <ingredient>cold boiled ham</ingredient> cut in very thin shavings (no matter if in small pieces), roll up very slowly and carefully, and place where it will not unroll. Treat each sandwich in the same manner, always spreading the bread with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> before cutting. If by chance the bread is baked with too hard a crust, cut off a thin shaving of the brownest part very smoothly before making into sandwiches.

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>There are various ways of making, but the three best kinds are dry, soft hop, and potato yeast. The dry should be made in May or June for summer use, and in October for winter use. In hot and damp weather, dry yeast sometimes loses its vitality; however, many use it on account of its convenience, since there is no danger of its souring in summer or freezing in winter. Soft hop or potato yeast will keep in a cool place one or two weeks in warm weather, and in cold weather five or six weeks, care being taken that it does not freeze. Never add soda to yeast; if it becomes sour it will do to start fresh yeast, but will <emph rend="italic">never</emph> make good bread. 
<purpose>Potato yeast</purpose>
is made either by boiling and mashing the <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> or by grating them while raw, and adding them to the <ingredient>boiling hop water</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">immediately</emph>, for if allowed to stand they darken; and the yeast will not be as white. <variation>A good way to prevent the potatoes from darkening is to grate them into a pan half filled with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient></variation> As grated the potatoes sink to the bottom; when done grating, pour off the water and add the potatoes to the <ingredient>boiling hop water.</ingredient> A stone jar with a close-fitting cover is best to keep yeast in, and should be scalded as often as emptied.

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>"LET all things be done decently and in order," and the first to put in order when you are going to bake is yourself. Secure the hair in a net or other covering, to prevent any from falling, and brush the shoulders and back to be sure none are lodged there that might blow off; make the hands and finger-nails clean, roll the sleeves up above the elbows, and put on a large, clean apron. Clean the kitchen table of utensils and every thing not needed, and provide every thing that will be needed until the cake is baked, not forgetting even the broom-splints previously picked off the new broom and laid away carefully in a little box. (A knitting-needle may be kept for testing cake instead of splints.) If it is warm weather place the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let stand a few minutes, as they will then make a finer froth, and be sure they are fresh, as they will not make a stiff froth with any amount of beating if old. Grease the pans with fresh <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> which is much better than butter; line the bottom with paper, using six or eight thicknesses if the 
<purpose>cake</purpose>
is large, and greasing the top one well. (In some ovens, however, fewer thicknesses of paper would be needed on the bottom, and in some the sides also should be lined with one or two thicknesses.) Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (if not pulverized) and measure or weigh. <ingredient>Firkin or very salt butter</ingredient> should be cut in bits and washed to freshen a little; if very hard, warm carefully, but in no case allow any of it to melt. Good butter must be used, as the heat develops any latent bad qualities. Beat the <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> thoroughly, and strain; set the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> away in a cool place until the cake is ready for them, then beat them vigorously in a cool room, till they will<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=49"/>

Sift a part of the measured <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> through a hand-sieve (which should be among the utensils of every housekeeper), and mix thoroughly with the rest of the flour. <variation>In using new flour for either breador cake-making, it can be "ripened" for use by placing the quantity intended for baking in the hot sun for a few hours, or before the kitchen fire.</variation> <variation>In using <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> note this: that <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> makes a spongy, light cake; <ingredient>sweet milk,</ingredient> one that cuts like pound cake; remembering that with <ingredient>sour milk soda</ingredient> alone is used, while with sweet milk <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> are to be added.</variation></p>
<p>Having thus gathered the material, beat the butter to a cream, add the sugar gradually, then the milk in small quantities (never use fresh and stale milk in same cake), next the <ingredient>yolks of eggs,</ingredient> then a part of the flour, then a part of the <ingredient>whites,</ingredient> and so on until the whole is used; lastly, add the <ingredient>flavoring.</ingredient> There is great "knack" in beating cake; don't <emph rend="italic">stir</emph>, but <emph rend="italic">beat</emph> thoroughly, bringing the batter up from the bottom of the dish at every stroke; in this way the air is driven into the cells of the batter, instead of out of them--but the cells will be finer if beaten more slowly at the last, remembering that the motion should always be upward. In winter it is easier to beat with the hand, but in summer a wooden spoon is better. Never beat a cake in tin, but use earthen or stoneware. All cakes not made with yeast should be baked as soon as possible after they are mixed. Unskillful mixing, too rapid or unequal baking, or a sudden decrease in heat before it is quite done, will cause streaks in the cake.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">FRUIT CAKE.</purpose>
Most ladies think fruit cake quite incomplete without wine or brandy, but it can be made equally good on strictly temperance principles, by substituting one-third of a cup of <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> for a wine-glass of brandy. <variation>To facilitate the operation of seeding <ingredient>raisins,</ingredient> pour <ingredient>boiling-water</ingredient> on a few at a time. This will not injure the fruit or cake. To seed, clip with the scissors, or cut with a sharp knife. Do not chop too fine; if for light fruit cake, seeding is all that is necessary.</variation> Slice the <ingredient>citron</ingredient> thin, and do not have the pieces too large, or they will cause the cake to break apart in cutting.<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=50"/>
<variation><ingredient>Currants</ingredient> should be kept prepared for use as follows: Wash in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> rubbing well, pour off water, and repeat until the water is clear; drain them in a sieve, spread on a cloth and rub dry; pick out bad ones, dry carefully in a cool oven, and set away for use.</variation> When the fruit is all mixed, cream the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>--this is very important in all cakes--add the <ingredient>spices,</ingredient> <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> or <ingredient>liquors,</ingredient> then the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> (if any is used), next the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> well beaten, adding <ingredient>whites</ingredient> with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as previously directed. Always beat whites and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> separately if many <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are used, but if only a few, it is just as well to beat both together. Next add the flour (which in making black fruit cake may be browned), prepared with <ingredient>baking-powder or soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar,</ingredient> then the <ingredient>flavoring</ingredient> (if any is used), and lastly the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> dredged with a <emph rend="italic">very little</emph> flour. <variation>Some prefer to <emph rend="italic">mix</emph> the fruit with all the flour.</variation></p>
<p><variation>In making very large cakes that require three or four hours to bake, an excellent way for 
<purpose>lining the pan</purpose>
is the following: Fit three papers carefully, grease thoroughly, make a paste of equal parts <ingredient>Graham</ingredient> and <ingredient>fine flour</ingredient> wet with <ingredient>water</ingredient> just stiff enough to spread easily with a spoon, place the first paper in the pan with the greased side down, and spread the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> evenly over the paper about as thick as pie-crust. In covering the sides of the pan, use a little paste to stick a portion of the <ingredient>paper</ingredient> to the top of the pan to keep it from slipping out of place, press the second paper carefully into its place with the greased side up, and next put in the third paper as you would into any <implement>baking-pan,</implement> and pour in the cake. Earthen pans are used by some, as they do not heat so quickly, and are less liable to burn the cake.</variation></p>
<p><variation>All except layer 
<purpose>cakes should be covered with a paper cap</purpose>
when first put into the oven. Take a square of <ingredient>brown paper</ingredient> large enough to cover well the cake-pan, cut off the corners, and lay a plait on four sides, fastening each with a pin so as to fit nicely over the pan. This will throw it up in the center, so that the cover will not touch the cake. Save the cap, as it can be used several times.</variation></p></recipe>
<hd align="center">THE OVEN.</hd><p>Too much care can not be given to the preparation of the oven, which is oftener too hot than too cool; however, an oven too cold at<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=51"/>first will ruin any cake. Cakes should rise and begin to bake before browning much, large cakes requiring a good, steady, solid heat, about such as for baking bread; layer cakes, a brisk hot fire, as they must be baked quickly. A good plan is to fill the stove with hard wood (ash is the best for baking), let it burn until there is a good body of heat, and then turn damper so as to throw the heat to the bottom of oven for fully ten minutes before the cake is put in. In this way a steady heat to start with is secured. Generally it is better to close the hearth when the cake is put in, as this stops the draft and makes a more regular heat. Keep adding wood in small quantities, for if the heat becomes slack the cake will be heavy. Great care must be taken, for some stoves need to have the dampers changed every now and then, but as a rule more heat is needed at the bottom of the oven than at the top. Many test their ovens in this way: if the hand can be held in from twenty to thirty-five seconds (or while counting twenty or thirty-five), it is a quick oven, from thirty-five to forty-five seconds is "moderate," and from forty-five to sixty seconds is "slow." Sixty seconds is a good oven to begin with for large fruit cakes. All systematic housekeepers will hail the day when some enterprising Yankee or Buckeye girl shall invent a stove or range with a thermometer attached to the oven, so that the heat may be regulated accurately and intelligently. If necessary to move the cake while baking, do it very gently. Be careful not to remove from the oven until done, and do not leave oven door open. Allow about thirty minutes for each inch of thickness in a quick oven, and more time in a slow one. Test with a broom-splint or knitting-needle, and if the dough does not adhere, it is done. Settling away from the pan a little, and stopping its "singing," are other indications that the cake is ready to leave the oven. It should remain in the pan at least fifteen minutes after taking from the oven, and it is better to leave the "cap" on until the cake is carefully removed from the pan and set away, <emph rend="italic">always</emph> right side up. A tin chest or stone jar is best to keep it in. Coffee cake should be put away before it is cold, and so closely wrapped in a large napkin that the aroma will not be lost.</p><pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=52"/>

The good quality of all delicate cake, and especially of sponge-cake, depends very much upon its being made with fresh <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> It must be quickly put together, beaten with rapidity, and baked in a rather quick oven.

Beat twelve <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and one pound <ingredient>pulverized sugar</ingredient> together very lightly, then stir in three-fourths pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> making batter as light as for sponge-cake, and thin enough to spread nicely when poured; make up as quickly as possible. Have shallow tin-pans prepared (about twelve by eighteen inches and an inch deep) by lining with thin brown paper, using no grease on pan or paper; pour in batter, spread out with a knife as thin as possible (about half an inch thick), and bake in solid oven. When done, remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, and while still warm, but not hot, turn out of pan upside down. With a brush or soft cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> brush over the paper and pull it off; spread cake thin with <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> and roll it up, being careful to place the outer edge of roll against something so that it will not unroll until cold. Sprinkle with <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> and serve. If baked in pans such as are described above, the recipe will make two rolls, each twelve inches long, which should be cut in two, making four rolls. Use no baking-powder, as it makes the cake too brittle. Many use none in sponge-cake.

When done, drain well in a <implement>skimmer,</implement> and place in a <implement>colander.</implement> The use of eggs prevents the dough from absorbing the fat. Doughnuts should be watched closely while frying, and the fire must be regulated very carefully. When you have finished frying, cut a potato in slices and put in the fat to clarify it, place the kettle away until the fat "settles," strain into an earthen pot kept for this purpose, and set in a cool place. The sediment remaining in the bottom of the kettle can be used for soap-grease. Fry in an iron kettle, the common skillet being too shallow for the purpose.

<section class1="breadsweets"><hd align="center" size="larger">GINGER-BREAD.</hd><p>If in making ginger-bread the dough becomes too stiff before it is rolled out, set it before the fire. Snaps will not be crisp if made on a rainy day. Ginger-bread and cakes require a moderate oven, snaps a quick one. If cookies or snaps become moist in keeping, put them in the oven and heat them for a few moments. Always use New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses, and never syrups. Soda is used to act on the "spirit" of the molasses. In making the old-fashioned, soft, square cakes of ginger-bread, put a portion of the dough on a well-floured tin sheet, roll evenly to each side, trim off evenly around the edges, and mark off in squares with a floured knife or wheel cutter. In this way the dough may be softer than where it is necessary to pick up to remove from board after rolling and cutting.</p><pb n="80" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=87"/>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p>
<purpose>For creams and custards</purpose> eggs should never be beaten in tin, but always in stone or earthen ware, as there is some chemical influence about tin which prevents their attaining that creamy lightness so desirable. Beat quickly and sharply right through the eggs, beating whites and yolks separately. <variation>When <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> is used for creams, it is better to soak it for an hour in a little <ingredient>cold water or milk,</ingredient> set in a warm place; when dissolved, pour into the hot custard just after removing from the stove.</variation> <variation><purpose>For custards</purpose> the common rule is four <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> one cup <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and one small half tea-spoon <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to each quart of <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Bake in a baking-dish until firm in the center, taking care that the heat is moderate or the custard will turn in part to whey. The delicacy of the custard depends on its being baked <emph rend="italic">slowly.</emph> It is much nicer to strain the yolks, after they are beaten, through a small wire strainer kept for this purpose by every good housekeeper.</variation> <variation><purpose>For boiled custards or floats</purpose> the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> alone may be used, or for economy's sake the entire eggs. Always place the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to boil in a custard-kettle (made of iron with another iron kettle inside, the latter lined with tin), or, in a pan or pail set within a kettle of <ingredient><emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water;</ingredient> when the milk reaches the boiling point, which is shown by a slight foam rising on top, add the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> which cools it so that the eggs will not curdle when added.</variation> <variation>Or, another convenient way is to mix the beaten and strained yolks with the sugar in a bowl, then add gradually several spoonfuls of the <ingredient>boiling milk,</ingredient> until the eggs and sugar are heated through, when they may be slowly stirred into the boiling milk. Let remain a few moments, stirring constantly until it thickens a little, but not long enough to curdle, then either set the pail immediately<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=91"/>in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> or turn out into a cold dish, adding flavoring extracts after removing from the stove. <ingredient>Peach leaves or vanilla beans</ingredient> give a fine flavor, but must be boiled in the milk and then taken out before the other ingredients are added. Boiled custards are very difficult to make, and must have the closest attention until they are finished.</variation></p></recipe>

it is not necessary to add gelatine. The filling may be made of <ingredient>well-whipped cream,</ingredient> flavored and sweetened. Fill the mold and set on <ingredient>ice</ingredient> to harden.

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="99" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=106"/><hd align="center" size="larger">CANNING FRUITS.</hd><p>Cleanse the cans thoroughly and test to see if any leak or are cracked. If tin cans leak, send them to the tinner; if discolored inside they may be lined with writing-paper just before using. In buying stoneware for canning purposes, be sure that it is well glazed, as fruits canned in jars or jugs imperfectly glazed sometimes become poisonous. Never use defective glass cans, but keep them for storing things in the pantry; and in buying them, take care that they are free from flaws and blisters, else the glass will crumble off in small particles when subjected to heat. <implement>Self-sealers</implement> are very convenient, but the heat hardens the <implement>rubber rings,</implement> which are difficult to replace, so that in a year or two they are unfit for use. For this reason many prefer those with a groove around the top for sealing with wax or putty. The latter is very convenient, as jars sealed with it can be opened readily with a strong fork or knife, and are much more easily cleaned than when wax-sealed. Putty may be bought ready for use, and is soon made soft by molding in the hand. In using it should be worked out into a small roll, and pressed firmly into the groove with a knife, care being taken to keep it well pressed down as the can cools.</p><p>Fruit should be selected carefully, and all that is imperfect rejected. Large fruits, such as peaches, pears, etc., are in the best condition to can when not quite fully ripe, and should be put up as soon as possible after picking; small fruits, such as berries, should never stand over night if it is possible to avoid it. The highest-flavored and longest-keeping fruits are best put up without paring, after having carefully removed the down with a fine but stiff brush. Use only the best sugar in the proportion of a half a<pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=107"/>pound of sugar to a pound of good fruit, varying the rule, of course, with the sweetness of the fruit. Or, in canning for pies omit sugar, as the natural flavor is better preserved without it, and some prefer this method for all purposes. It is economical, and well worthy of experiment. Cans put up in this way should have a special mark so as to distinguish them from the rest. When ready to can, first place the jars (glass) in a large pan of warm water on the back of the stove, make ready the syrup in a nice clean porcelain kettle, add the fruit--it is better to prepare only enough fruit or syrup for two or three cans at a time--and by the time it is done, the water in the pan will be hot and the cans ready for use. Take them out of the water and set them on a hot platter, which answers the double purpose of preventing their contact with any cold surface like the table, and saving any fruit that may be spilled. Fill as full as possible, and set aside where no current of air will strike them--or, better, wring out a towel wet in hot water and set them on it--let stand a moment or two or until wiped off, when the fruit will have shrunk away a little; fill up again with hot syrup, or, if you have none, boiling water from the tea-kettle will do, and then seal. In canning peaches, the flavor is improved by adding two or three whole peaches, or dropping in the center of the can a few of the stones. For peaches, pears and berries, some sweeten as for eating, let stand until sugar is dissolved (using no water), place on stove in porcelain kettle and keep at boiling point long enough to heat the fruit, and then can in glass jars as directed.</p><p>There are several other ways of preparing glass cans for fruit, among them the following: Wring a towel from cold water, double and wrap closely about and under the can so as to exclude the air, and put a cold silver spoon inside and fill; or, put a towel in a <implement>steamer,</implement> set in the cans, and place over a kettle of <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water, boil the water, and when ready to fill, remove the cans and wrap in a towel wrung from warm water, put a table-spoon rinsed in hot water inside, and fill; or, wash the cans in tepid water, place an iron rod inside, and at once pour in the boiling fruit, but not too fast. In using glass cans with tops which screw on, be sure that the <implement>rubbers</implement> are firm and close-fitting, and throw away all that are imperfect. When the can is filled to overflowing, put on the top<pb n="101" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=108"/>at once and screw down tightly, and as the fruit and cans cool, causing contraction of the glass, turn down again and again until perfectly air-tight. Wrap as soon as cold with brown wrapping-paper unless the fruit-closet is very dark. Light injures all fruit, but especially tomatoes, in which it causes the formation of citric acid which no amount of sugar will sweeten. The place where canned fruits are kept should also be dry and cool. In canning, use a porcelain-lined kettle, silver fork or broom-splint, and <implement>wire spoon</implement> or <implement>dipper.</implement> A steel fork discolors the fruit.</p><p>Cans should be examined two or three days after filling, and if syrup leaks out from the rim, they should be unsealed, the fruit thoroughly cooked and kept for jam or jelly, as it will have lost the delicacy of color and flavor so desirable in canned fruits. Pint cans are better for berries than quart. Strawberries keep their color best in stone jars; if glass cans are used for them, they should be buried in sand.</p><p>In using self-sealing cans the <implement>rubber ring</implement> must show an even edge all round, for if it slips back out of sight at any point, air will be admitted. On opening tin cans, remember to pour <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the fruit out into an earthen or glass dish. Wines, cider, shrubs, etc., must be bottled, well corked, sealed, and the bottles placed on their sides in a box of sand or sawdust. To can maple syrup, pour either hot or cold into cans or jugs, and seal well.</p><p>The fine display of canned fruits at the Centennial Exhibition was prepared as follows: The fruits were selected with great care, of uniform size and shape, and <emph rend="italic">all perfect.</emph> They were carefully peeled with a thin, sharp, silver <implement>fruit-knife,</implement> which did not discolor them, and immediately plunged into cold water in an earthen or wooden vessel to prevent the air from darkening them. As soon as enough for one can was prepared, it was put up by laying the fruit piece by piece in the can, and pouring syrup, clear as crystal, over it, and then, after subjecting the whole to the usual heat, sealing up.</p>

<recipe class1="beverages">
<p>
<purpose>Roast coffee</purpose>
with the greatest care--for here lies the secret of success in coffee-making--and in small quantities, for there is a peculiar freshness of flavor when newly roasted. Pick over carefully, wash and dry in a moderate oven, increase the heat and roast quickly, either in the oven, or on top of the stove or range; in the latter case, stir <emph rend="italic">constantly,</emph> and in the oven stir <emph rend="italic">often,</emph> with a wooden spoon or ladle kept for this purpose. The <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> must be thoroughly and evenly roasted to a dark rich brown, not black, throughout, and must be free from any burnt grains, a few of which will ruin the flavor of a large quantity. It must be tender and brittle, to test which take a grain, place it on the table, press with the thumb and if it can be crushed, it is done. Stir in a lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> while the coffee is hot, or wait until about half cold and then stir in a well-beaten <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> The latter plan is very economical, as coffee so prepared needs no further clarifying. Keep in a closely-covered tin or earthen vessel. Never attempt other work while roasting coffee, but give it the entire attention. Do not grind too fine, and only in quantities as needed, for the flavor is dissipated if it is long unused after grinding, even when under cover. If properly roasted, coffee will grind into distinct, hard, and gritty particles and not into a powder.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">FILTERED COFFEE.</purpose>
The National <implement>Coffee-pot</implement> is so widely known as not to need description here, but the "gude wife" can improvise one equally as desirable and much simpler. Make a sack of fine flannel, or canton flannel, as long as the <implement>coffee-pot</implement> is deep, and a little larger than the top; stitch up the side seam to within an inch and a half of the top, bend a piece of small but rather stiff wire in a circle, and slip it through a hem made around the top of the sack, bringing the ends together at the opening left and the top of the side seam. Having put the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in the sack, lower it into the <implement>coffee-pot</implement> with the ends of the wire next to the handle, spread the ends of the wire apart slightly, and push it down over the top of the pot. The top of the sack will then be turned down a little over the outside of the pot, a part of it covering the "nose," and keeping in all the aroma, the elasticity of the wire causing it to close tight around the pot, holding the sack close to its sides. Instead of a wire (which must be removed to wash the sack after using), a tape may be used by tying the ends after turning the top of sack down. When the sack, with the coffee in it is in its place, pour the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over the coffee, close the lid tightly, and let simmer (not boil) fifteen minutes to half an hour. In pouring for the table raise the sack off the nose but not out of pot. This makes good coffee without eggs or any thing else to settle it.</p></recipe>

Fish must be fresh, the fresher the better--those being most perfect which go straight from their native element into the hands of the cook. The white kinds are least nutritious; and the oily, such as salmon, eels, herrings, etc., most difficult of digestion.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>As soon as possible after <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are caught, remove all scales (these may be loosened by pouring on <ingredient>hot water</ingredient>), and scrape out entrails and every particle of blood and the white skin that lies along the backbone, being careful not to crush the fish more than is absolutely necessary in

sprinkle with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and let stand over night, or at least a few hours, before cooking; rinse off, wipe dry, and to completely absorb all the moisture, place in a folded napkin a short time.

<p>Fish should always be well cooked, being both unpalatable and unwholesome when underdone. For boiling, a <implement>fish-kettle</implement> is almost indispensable, as it is very difficult to remove a large fish without breaking from an ordinary kettle. The <implement>fish-kettle</implement> is an <implement>oblong boiler,</implement> in which is suspended a perforated tin plate, with a handle at each end, on which the fish rests while boiling, and with which it is lifted out when done. From this tin it is easily slipped off to the<pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=134"/>platter on which it goes to the table. When no <implement>fish-kettle</implement> is at hand, wrap in a cloth, lay in a circle on a plate, and set in the kettle. When done the fish may be lifted out gently by the cloth and thus removed to the platter.</p><p>In frying by dipping into hot fat or drippings (or olive oil is still better), a wire basket, in which the fish is placed and lowered into the fat, is a great convenience.</p><p>One of the most essential things in serving fish, is to have every thing hot, and quickly dished, so that all may go to the table at once. Serve fresh fish with squash and green pease, salt fish with beets and carrots, salt pork and potatoes with either.</p><p>In the East there is a great variety of fish in the winter. The blue fish is excellent boiled or baked with a stuffing of bread, butter, and onions. Sea bass are boiled with egg-sauce, and garnished with parsley. Salmon are baked or boiled, and smelts are cooked by dropping into boiling fat. The sheep's-head, which requires most cooking of all fish, is always stuffed and baked.</p><p>Nearly all the larger fresh fish are boiled, the medium-sized are baked or broiled, and the small are fried. The very large ones are cut up and sold in pieces of convenient size.</p><p>In cooking fish, care must be taken not to use the same knives or spoons in the preparation of it and other food, or the latter will be tainted with the fishy flavor.</p><p>In boiling fish, allow five to ten minutes to the pound, according to thickness, after the water begins to boil. To test, pass a knife along a bone, and if done the fish will separate easily. Remove the moment it is done, or it will become "woolly" and insipid.</p>

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=141"/><hd align="center" size="larger">FRUITS.</hd><p>The arrangement of fresh fruits for the table affords play for the most cultivated taste and not a little real inventive genius. Melons, oranges, and indeed all kind of fruits, are appropriate breakfast dishes; and a raised center-piece of mixed fruits furnishes a delicious dessert, and is an indispensable ornament to an elegant dinner-table. Melons should be kept on ice, so as to be thoroughly chilled when served. Clip the ends of water-melons, cut them across in halves, set up on the clipped ends on a platter, and serve the pulp only, removing it with a spoon; or, cut across in slices, and serve with rind. Nutmeg melons should be set on the blossom end, and cut in several equal pieces from the stem downward, leaving each alternate piece still attached; the others may then be loosened, and the seeds removed, when the melon is ready to serve. Fruit should be carefully selected. Havana and Florida oranges are the best, but do not keep well, and on the whole, the Messina are preferable. A rough yellow skin covers the sweetest oranges, the smooth being more juicy and acid; a greenish tinge indicates that they were picked unripe. The Messina lemons, "November cut," are the best, and come into market in the spring. Freestone peaches with yellow meat are the handsomest, but not always the sweetest. California pears take the lead for flavor, the Bartlett being the best. The best winter pear is the "Winter Nellis." The "Pound" pear is the largest, but is good only for cooking. Fine-grained pears are best for eating. A pyramid of grapes made up of Malagas, Delawares, and Concords, makes a showy center-piece and a delicious dessert. The Malaga leads all foreign grapes, and comes packed in cork-dust which is a non-conductor of heat and absorbent of moisture, and so is always in<pb n="135" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=142"/>good condition. Of native grapes, the Delaware keeps longest. In pine-apples the "Strawberry" is best, while the "Sugar Loaf" ranks next, but they are so perishable that to keep even for a few days they must be cooked. When served fresh they should be cut in small squares and sprinkled with sugar. Buy cocoa-nut cautiously in summer, heat being likely to sour the milk. In almonds, the Princess is the best variety to buy in the shell; of the shelled, the "Jordan" is the finest, though the "Sicily" is good. For cake or confectionery, the shelled are most economical. In raisins the "Seedless" rank first for puddings and fine cakes, but the "Valencia" are cheaper and more commonly used; for table use, loose "Muscatels" and layer raisins (of which the "London Layer" is the choicest brand) take the preference. In melons, every section has its favorite varieties, any of which make a wholesome and luscious <implement>dessert dish.</implement> Sliced fruits or berries are more attractive and palatable sprinkled with sugar about an hour before serving, and then with pounded ice just before sending to the table. An <implement>apple-corer,</implement> a cheap tin tube, made by any tinner, is indispensable in preparing apples for cooking. They are made in two sizes, one for crab-apples and the other for larger varieties.</p>

The thigh is especially deemed a choice tidbit. The leg is the finest part of the snipe, but generally the breast is the most juicy and nutritious part of birds.</p><p>Birds should be carefully plucked or skinned, drawn, wiped clean, and all shot removed. Game should not be washed, unless absolutely necessary for cleanliness. With care in dressing, wiping will render them perfectly clean. If necessary to wash, do it quickly and use as little water as possible. The more plainly all kinds of game are cooked, the better they retain their fine flavor. They require a brisker fire than poultry, but take less time to cook. Their color, when done, should be a fine yellowish brown. Serve on toast.</p>

Set the custard and also the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> (not beaten) in a cool place until needed, and about three hours before serving begin the preparations for freezing. Put the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in a coarse coffee-sack, pound with an ax or mallet until the lumps are no larger than a small hickory-nut; see that the freezer is properly set in the tub, the beater in and the cover secure; place around it a layer of ice about three inches thick, then a layer of <ingredient>coarse salt</ingredient>--<ingredient>rock salt</ingredient> is best--then ice again, then salt, and so on until packed full, with a layer of ice last. The proportion should be about three-fourths ice and one-fourth salt. Pack very solid, pounding with a broom-handle or stick, then remove the cover and pour the custard to which you have just added the well-whipped whites into the freezer, filling two-thirds full to give room for expansion; replace the cover and begin turning the freezer; after ten minutes pack the ice down again, drain off most of the water, add more ice and turn again, repeating<pb n="148" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=155"/>
this operation several times until the cream is well frozen, and you can no longer turn the beater. (The above quantity ought to freeze in half an hour, but the more pure cream used the longer it takes to freeze). Brush the ice and salt from and remove the cover, take out the beater, scrape the cream down from the sides of freezer, beat well several minutes with a wooden paddle, replace the cover, fill the hole with a cork, pour off all the water, pack again with ice, (using salt at the bottom, but none at the top of tub), heap the ice on the cover, spread over it a piece of carpet or a thick woollen blanket, and set away in a cool place until needed; or, if molds are used, fill them when you remove the beater, packing the cream in very tightly, and place in ice and salt for two hours.

<p>The following directions for 
<purpose>making "self-freezing ice-cream"</purpose>
are from <attribution>"Common Sense in the Household."</attribution> After preparing the freezer as above, but leaving out the beater, remove the lid carefully, and with a long wooden ladle or flat stick beat the <ingredient>custard</ingredient> as you would batter steadily for five or six minutes. Replace the lid, pack the <ingredient>ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over it, covering it with about two inches of the mixture; spread above all several folds of blanket or carpet, and leave it untouched for an hour; at the end of that time remove the ice from above the freezer-lid, wipe off carefully and open the freezer. Its sides will be lined with a thick layer of frozen cream. Displace this with the ladle or a long knife, working every part of it loose; beat up the custard again firmly and vigorously, until it is all smooth, half-congealed paste. The perfection of the ice-cream depends upon the thoroughness of the beating at this point. Put on the cover again, pack in more ice and salt, turn off the brine, cover the freezer entirely with the ice, and spread over all, the carpet. At the end of two or three hours more, again turn off the brine and add fresh ice and salt, but do not open the freezer for two hours more. At that time take the freezer from the ice, open it, wrap a towel wet in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> about the lower part, and turn out a solid column of ice-cream, close grained, firm, delicious. Any of the recipes for custard ice-cream may be frozen in this way.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>Inattention to the temperature of the water and too early application of salt cause great waste in 
<purpose>boiling meats.</purpose>
To make fresh <ingredient>meat</ingredient> rich and nutritious it should be placed in a kettle of <ingredient><emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water</ingredient> (pure soft water is best), skimmed well as soon as it begins to boil again, and placed where it will slowly but constantly simmer. The meat should be occasionally turned and kept well under the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and fresh <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> supplied as it evaporates in boiling. The hot water hardens the fibrine on the outside, encasing and retaining the rich juices--and the whole theory of correct cooking in a nut-shell, is to retain as much as possible of the nutriment of food. No salt should be added until the meat is nearly done, as it extracts the juices of the meat if added too soon. Boil gently, as rapid boiling hardens the fibrine and renders the meat hard, tasteless, and scarcely more nutritious than leather, without really hastening the process of cooking, every degree of heat beyond the boiling point being worse than wasted. <variation><purpose>Salt meat</purpose> should be put on in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> so that it may freshen in cooking. Allow twenty minutes to the pound for fresh, and thirty-five for salt meats, the time to be modified, of course, by the quality of the meat.</variation> <variation>A pod of <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will prevent the unpleasant odor of boiling from filling the house.</variation></p></recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose>Roasting</purpose>
is almost unknown in these days of stoves and ranges--baking, a much inferior process, having taken its place. In roasting proper, the joint is placed close to a brisk fire, turned so as to expose every part to the heat, and then moved back to finish in a more moderate heat. The roast should be basted frequently with the <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> and when half cooked, with <ingredient>salt and water.</ingredient> In preparing<pb n="162" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=169"/>
roasts, dash them over with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> wash quickly and wipe dry. English cooks never wash <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> but wipe with a towel wrung out of <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> <variation><purpose>To bake,</purpose> place in the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> with bony side up, <ingredient>flour</ingredient> well, put one pint <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in pan, adding more when needed, and set in a rather brisk oven, afterward graduated to a moderate heat. Baste frequently, turning the pan often so that the parts may roast equally, and when about half done add pieces of <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> and a few <ingredient>sprigs of parsley,</ingredient> flour again, <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> turn over and flour the other side, seasoning with salt and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> about half an hour before serving.</variation> Many <ingredient>roast meat</ingredient> on a grate placed in the <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> adding but little <ingredient>water</ingredient> at a time (when there is too much the meat is steamed instead of roasting, and the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> will not become brown). In roasting all <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> success depends upon flouring thoroughly, basting frequently, turning often so as to prevent burning, and carefully regulating the heat of the oven. Allow fifteen to twenty-five minutes to the pound in roasting, according as it is to be rare or well done, taking into consideration the quality of the meat. Roasts prepared with dressing require more time. In roasting meats many think it better not to add any water until the meat has been in the oven about half an hour, or until it begins to brown.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose>Broiling</purpose>
is a far more wholesome method of cooking <ingredient>meats</ingredient> than frying. Tough <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is made more tender by pounding or hacking with a dull knife, but some of the juices are lost by the operation; cutting it across in small squares with a <emph rend="italic">sharp</emph> knife on both sides is better than either. Trim off all superfluous fat, but never wash a freshly-cut steak. Place the steak on a hot, well-greased <implement>gridiron,</implement> turn often so that the outside may be seared at once; when done, which will require from five to ten minutes, dish on a hot platter, season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and bits of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> cover with a hot platter and serve at once. A small pair of tongs are best to turn steaks, as piercing with a fork frees the juices. If fat drips on the coals below, the blaze may be extinguished by sprinkling with salt, always withdrawing the <implement>gridiron</implement> to prevent the steak from acquiring a smoky flavor. Always have a brisk fire, whether you cook in a <implement>patent broiler</implement> directly over the fire, or on a <implement>gridiron</implement> over a bed of live coals. Broiling steak is the very last thing to be done<pb n="163" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=170"/>
in getting breakfast or dinner; every other dish should be ready for the table, so that this may have the cook's undivided attention. A steel <implement>gridiron</implement> with slender bars is best, as the common, broad, flat, iron bars fry and scorch the meat, imparting a disagreeable flavor. Never season with salt while cooking.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose>Frying</purpose>
is properly cooking in <ingredient>fat</ingredient> enough to cover the article, and when the fat is hot, and properly managed, the food is crisped at the surface, and does not absorb the fat. The process of cooking in just enough fat to prevent sticking has not yet been named in English, and is <emph rend="italic">saut&#233;ing,</emph> but is popularly known as frying.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose>To thaw frozen meat,</purpose>
place in a warm room over night, or lay it for a few hours in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--the latter plan being the best. The ice which forms on the surface as it thaws easily removed. If cooked before it is entirely thaws is easily removed. If cooked before it is entirely thawed it will be tough. <ingredient>Meat</ingredient> once frozen should not be allowed to thaw until just before cooking.</p></recipe>
<p>Beef in boiling loses rather more than one-quarter; in roasting it loses one-third; legs of muttong lose one-fifth in boiling, and one-third in roasting, and a loin of mutton in roasting loses rather more than a third.</p>
<p>Beef suet may be kept a long time in a cool place without freezing, or by burying it deep in the <implement>flour barrel</implement> so as to entirely exclude the air.</p>

When freshly-made butter can not be had, work well two or three times in cool, fresh water.</p><p>A very nice paste for family use may be made by reducing the quantity of shortening to even so little as a half pound to a quart of flour, especially when children or dyspeptics are to be considered. With the exception of mince-pies, which are warmed over before serving, pastry should be eaten the day it is made. In warm weather, when not ready to bake immediately after making up paste, keep it in the <implement>ice-chest</implement> till wanted, several days if necessary, and, in any event, it is better to let it thus remain for one or two hours.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<purpose>To prevent the juice of pies from soaking into the under crust,</purpose>
beat an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> well, and with a bit of cloth dipped into the egg, rub over the crust before filling the pies.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<purpose>For a more wholesome pie-crust shortening,</purpose>
boil <ingredient>beans or potatoes</ingredient> until soft, make into a broth, work through a <implement>colander,</implement> mix as much into the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as can be done and preserve sufficient tenacity in the dough. Knead moderately stiff, and roll a little thicker than crust shortened with <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> It is a good plan to make a <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient> for the top crust, and for the under crust use less shortening. Many practice this, adding a little <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> to the under crust--one half as much soda as cream tartar, which is always the rule when these ingredients are used in biscuit, cake, etc.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<purpose>When using green currants, pie-plant, gooseberries, or other fruits which require the juice to be thickened,</purpose>
fill the lower crust, sprinkle <ingredient>corn starch</ingredient> evenly over, and put on the upper crust. This prevents the juice from running over, and, when cold, forms a <pb n="182" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=189"/>

Always use tin pie-pans, since, in earthen pans, the under crust is not likely to be well baked. <variation>Just before putting on the upper crust, wet the rim of the lower <emph rend="italic">with a thick paste of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient></emph> or <ingredient>egg</ingredient> and flour, and press the two crusts firmly together; this will prevent that bane of all pastry cooks--a burst pie.</variation> Bake fruit pies in a moderate oven, having a better heat at the bottom than at the top of the oven, or the lower crust will be clammy and raw. When done, the crust will separate from the pan, so that the pie may be easily removed. Remove at once from the tins, or the crust will become "soggy."</p></recipe>
<p>The vices of the mince-pie have served to point many a hygienic moral, but while it is quite true that it is not strictly hygienic, it is not an every-day dish. The mince-pie is one of the few articles of food that have come down to us from a remote period, and it still has the flavor of old associations and the solid respectability which belongs to centuries of history and tradition. It is less to be feared than many apparently simple forms of highly concentrated food, such as butter and sugar, and often a piece of common pound-cake will produce a bigger "nightmare" than a piece of the richest mince-pie. Mince-pie, if not rich, is not the real thing, and it is its deterioration, and the fact that it is left nowadays, like almost every thing else, to servants, who do not even know how to properly boil a piece of beef, that have brought it into disrepute. Its preparation should be confined to no careless or unworthy hands, but every ingredient should be thoughtfully provided and delicately prepared, and the whole put together and blended with the skill of an artist, and the precision of a mechanic. Tact, wisdom, judgment, knowledge, and experience all go into the proper construction of a genuine mince-pie, to say nothing of kindness of heart and liberality of disposition.</p>

<p>In 
<purpose>making puddings</purpose>
always beat the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> separatley, straining the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and adding the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> the last thing. If boiled <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used, let it cool somewhat before adding the eggs; when <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is added, stir it in at the last. <ingredient>Raisins</ingredient> are better to lie in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> for one or two minutes until they are plumped. Puddings are either baked, boiled or steamed; rice, bread, custard, and fruit puddings require a moderate heat; batter and corn starch, a rather quick oven. Always bake them as soon as mixed.</p></recipe>

Wring the bag out of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> the inside well, pour in the pudding, tie securely leaving room to swell (especially when made of Indian meal, bread, rice, or crackers), and place in a kettle with a saucer at the bottom to prevent burning; pour in enough <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to entirely cover the bag, which must be turned several times, keep it boiling constantly, filling up from the tea-kettle when needed.</variation> <variation>If the pudding is boiled in a bowl, <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> fill, and cover with a square of drilling wrung out of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed and tied on.</variation> <variation>To use a pan, tie a cloth tightly over the rim, bringing the ends back together, and pinning them over the top of the pan; the pudding may then be lifted out easily by a strong fork put through the ends or corners of the cloth.</variation> <variation><purpose>For plum puddings,</purpose> invert the pan when put in the kettle,<pb n="196" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=203"/>

When the pudding is done, give whatever it is boiled in, a quick plunge into <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and turn out at once, serving immediately.</variation> As a general rule, boiled puddings require double the time required for baked.

<chapter class1="accompaniments"><pb n="213" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=220"/><hd align="center" size="larger">PRESERVES.</hd><p>Preserves, to be perfect, must be made with the greatest care. Economy of time and trouble is a waste of fruit and sugar. The best are made by putting only a small amount of fruit at a time in the syrup, after the latter has been carefully prepared and clarified, and the fruit neatly pared. It is difficult to watch a large quantity so as to insure its being done to a turn.</p><p>The old rule is "a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit," but since the introduction of cans, three-quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is sufficient, and even less is sometimes used, the necessity for an excess of sugar having passed away, as preserves may be less sweet, with no risk of fermentation, if sealed. Either tin or glass cans may be used, care being taken to make the sealing perfect.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><ingredient>Quinces,</ingredient> <ingredient>pears,</ingredient> <ingredient>citrons,</ingredient> <ingredient>watermelon-rinds,</ingredient> and many of the smaller <ingredient>fruits,</ingredient> such as <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> etc., harden when put, at first, into a syrup made of their weight ofsugar. To prevent this they should be cooked till tender in <ingredient>water, or in a weak syrup</ingredient> made from a portion only of the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> adding the remainder afterward. In 
<purpose>preserving fruits,</purpose>
such as <ingredient>peaches,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> <ingredient>plums,</ingredient> and <ingredient>strawberries,</ingredient> which are likely to become too soft in cooking, it is a good plan to pour the <ingredient>hot syrup</ingredient> over the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and let it remain over night, <variation>or to strew over it a part or all the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and allow it to stand a few hours; by either method the juice is extracted, and the fruit hardened.</variation> <variation>Another approved method of <purpose>hardening fruit</purpose>
is to skim it out of syrup, after cooking a few minutes and lay it in the hot sun two or three hours, and then pour over it the boiling syrup.</variation><pb n="214" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=221"/>
Long protracted boiling destroys the pleasant natural flavor of the fruit, and darkens it.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>Preserves should boil gently to avoid the danger of burning, and in order that the sugar may thoroughly penetrate the fruit. 
<purpose>A good syrup is made</purpose>
in the proportion of half pint <ingredient>water</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Put the sugar and water over the fire in a porcelain kettle and, just before it boils, stir in the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> beaten lightly with two table-spoons water; and, as it begins to boil, remove the scum with great care; boil until no more scum arises, and then add <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> <variation>Or the white of the egg may be mixed thoroughly with the dry sugar in the kettle, and the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> poured over, when all impurities will immediately rise to the surface with the egg.</variation>Preserves may be made from <ingredient>canned fruit</ingredient> (and some prefer to do this rather than make in the hot season), using less sugar than the rule. When preserving <ingredient>canned peaches or apples,</ingredient> it is an improvement to add a few <ingredient>sliced oranges.</ingredient></p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>
<purpose>Marmalades, or the different butters,</purpose>
will be smoother and better flavored, and will require less boiling, if the <ingredient>fruit (peaches, quinces, oranges, and apples make the best)</ingredient> is well cooked and mashed before adding either <ingredient>sugar or cider.</ingredient> It is important to stir constantly.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>In making either preserves or marmalades, follow the directions as regards kettle, sugar, and putting up, already given for jellies and jams, taking care not to cover or put away any of them till cold. 
<purpose>When preserves are candied,</purpose>
set jar in kettle of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let boil for an hour; <variation>or put them in a <implement>crock</implement> kept for that purpose, set in oven and boil a few minutes, watching carefully to prevent burning.</variation> When specks of mold appear, take them off carefully, and scald preserves as above directed.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>
<purpose>Dried fruits</purpose>
are much better and require less boiling, if <ingredient>clean soft water</ingredient> is poured over them and allowed to stand over night. In the morning boil until tender in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> sweetening five minutes before removing from the stove.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>
<purpose>To dry corn or fruits nicely,</purpose>
spread in shallow boxes or box covers, and cover with mosquito netting to prevent flies reaching them. When dry, put up in jars and cover closely, or in paper sacks. <ingredient>Dried peaches</ingredient> are better when halved and the cavities sprinkled with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> in drying. The <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> must be good, however, as poor<pb n="215" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=222"/>
fruit can not be redeemed by any process. <variation>Another excellent way is to dry them in the oven, and, when about half done, place in a <implement>crock</implement> a layer of <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> alternately with a layer of sugar.</variation> <variation>
<purpose>Cherries and currants are excellent dried as follows:</purpose>
Put in jars first a layer of <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> then a layer of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> in the proportion of half a pound sugar to pound of fruit, let stand over night, place them to boil, skimming off all scum, let boil ten or fifteen minutes, skim out and spread on dishes to dry in the sun, or by the fire, turning frequently until dry. They may then be packed in jars with sugar, or put away in paper sacks, and are an excellent substitute for raisins in puddings or mince-pies.</variation></p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>The secret of keeping dried fruit is to <emph rend="italic">exclude the light.</emph> Paper sacks, or a barrel or box lined with paper, are secure against moths. 
<purpose>Reheating fruit</purpose>
makes it dark in color, and impairs its flavor. An excellent method is to steam the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> as soon as dried, in a vegetable <implement>steamer</implement> (wrapping <ingredient>small fruits or corn</ingredient> in a cloth to prevent their falling through), stirring with the hand until the heat is too great to bear; remove to a pan, dry thoroughly, and put up in paper sacks or in <implement>stone crocks,</implement> tying a strong cloth tight over the top. Always fill a fruit-can, and keep for common use, to avoid opening the large jars often.</p></recipe>

If corks seem too small, throw them in <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> if too large, pound the sides with a hammer. The tighter they fit in the bottles, the better for the pickles. Glass cans, the tops or covers of which have become defective, can be used by supplying them with corks.

Scald well by dipping in and out of a pail or tub of boiling water, being careful not to scald so much as to set the feathers and make them more difficult to pluck; place the fowl on a board with head towards you, pull the feathers away from you, which will be in the direction they naturally lie (if pulled in a contrary direction the skin is likely to be torn), be careful to remove all the pin-feathers with a knife or pair of tweezers; singe, but not smoke, over blazing paper, place on a <implement>meat-board,</implement> and with a sharp knife cut off the legs a little below the knee, to prevent the muscles from shrinking away from the joint, and remove the oil-bag above the tail; take out the crop, either by making a slit at the back of the neck or in front (the last is better), taking care that every thing pertaining to the crop or windpipe is removed, cut the neck-bone off close to the body, leaving the skin a good length if to be stuffed; cut a slit three inches long from the tail upwards, being careful to cut only through the skin, put in the finger at the breast and detach all the intestines, taking care not to burst the gall-bag (situated near the upper part of the breast-bone, and attached to the liver; if broken, no washing can remove the bitter taint left on every spot it touches); put in the hand at the incision near the tail, and draw out carefully all intestines; trim off the fat from the breast and at the lower incision; split the gizzard and take out the inside and inner lining (throw liver, heart, and gizzard into water, wash well, and lay aside to be cooked and used for the gravy);<pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=245"/>wash the fowl thoroughly in several waters (some wipe carefully without washing), hang up to drain and it is ready to be stuffed, skewered, and placed to roast. To make it look plump, before stuffing, flatten the breast-bone by placing several thicknesses of cloth over it and pounding it, being careful not to break the skin, and rub the inside well with salt and pepper. Stuff the breast first but not too full or it will burst in cooking; stuff the body rather fuller than the breast, sew up both openings with strong thread, and sew the skin of the neck over upon the back or down upon the breast (these threads must be carefully removed before sending to the table). Lay the points of the wings under the back, and fasten in that position with a <implement>skewer</implement> run through both wings and held in place with a twine; press the legs as closely towards the breast and side bones as possible, and fasten with a <implement>skewer</implement> run through the body and both thighs, push a short <implement>skewer</implement> through above the tail, and tie the ends of the legs down with a twine close upon the <implement>skewer</implement> (or, if <implement>skewers</implement> are not used, tie well in shape with twine); rub over thoroughly with salt and pepper, thin lard (see p. 141), or place in pan and lay on slices of pork, or fat taken out of the fowl, and dredge well with flour, and place to roast in an oven rather hot at first, and then graduate the heat to moderate until done, to test which insert a fork between the thigh and body; if the juice is watery and not bloody it is done. If not served at once, the fowl may be kept hot without drying up, by placing over a skillet full of boiling water (set on top of stove or range), and inverting a <implement>dripping pan</implement> over it. Many persons roast fowls upon a wire rack or <implement>trivet</implement> placed inside the <implement>dripping pan.</implement> The pan should be three inches deep, and measure at the bottom about sixteen by twenty inches, with sides somewhat flaring. In roasting a turkey, allow fifteen minutes time for every pound. Some steam turkey before roasting, and a <implement>turkey-steamer</implement> may be easily improvised by placing the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> containing the turkey, on top of two or three pieces of wood (hickory or maple is the best) laid in the bottom of a <implement>wash-boiler,</implement> with just enough water to cover the wood; put on the lid, which should fit tightly on the <implement>boiler,</implement> and as the water boils away add more. Add the liquor in the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> to the turkey when placed in the oven to roast (do not use the water from the <implement>boiler</implement>).<pb n="239" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=246"/>Boil the giblets until tender in a separate dish, and add them, well chopped, together with water in which they were cooked, to the gravy.</p><hd align="center">TO CUT UP A CHICKEN.</hd><p>Pick, singe, and draw; lay the chicken on a board kept for the purpose, cut off the feet at first joint; cut a slit in the neck, take out the windpipe and crop, cut off the wings and legs at the joint which unites them to the body, separate the first joint of the leg from the second, cut off the oil bag, make a slit horizontally under the tail, cut the end of the entrails loose, extend the slit on each side to the joint where the legs were cut off; then, with the left hand, hold the breast of the chicken, and, with the right, bend back the rump until the joint in back separates, cut it clear and place in water. Take out the entrails, using a sharp knife to separate the eggs (if any), and all other particles to be removed, from the back, being careful in removing the heart and liver not to break the gall-bag (a small sack of a blue-green color about an inch long attached to the liver); separate the back and breast; commence at the high point of the breast and cut downwards toward the head, taking off part of the breast with the wish-bone; cut the neck from that part of the back to which the ribs are attached, turn the skin off the neck, and take out all lumps and stringy substances; very carefully remove the gall-bag from the liver, and clean the gizzard by making an incision through the thick part and first lining, peeling off the fleshy part, leaving the inside whole and ball-shaped; if the lining breaks, open the gizzard, pour out contents, peel off inner lining, and wash thoroughly. After washing in second water, the chicken is ready to be cooked. When young chickens are to be baked, with a sharp knife cut open the back at the side of the back-bone, press apart, and clean as above directed, and place in <implement>dripping pan,</implement> skin side up.</p><p>Chickens are stuffed and roasted in the same way as turkeys, and are much better for being first steamed, especially if over a year old. Roast for twenty or thirty minutes, or till nicely browned. Some prefer to broil or fry old chickens after first steaming until tender, but stewing or boiling is better.</p><pb n="240" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=247"/><p>Some, in making chicken or meat pies, line the dish with the lower crust, and place in the oven until well "set," then fill, cover, and bake; others, instead of lining the entire surface of the dish, line only the sides.</p><p>The garnishes for turkey and chicken are parsley, slices of lemon, fried sausages, or forced-meat balls.</p>

<purpose>shell-fish,</purpose> and are an important article of food from September to May. In most localities they are not more expensive than meats, and the great variety of ways in which they can be cooked, makes them a favorite with house-keepers. Oysters in the shell must be kept in a cool cellar and occasionally sprinkled with salt water. When fresh the shell is firmly closed; if opened the oyster is dead and unfit for use. The small-shelled oysters have the finest flavor. For the freshness of canned oysters it is necessary to trust to the dealer. <variation>In preparing them for cooking or for the table, be careful to remove all bits of shell; never salt oysters for soups or stews till just before removing them from the fire, or they will shrivel up and be hard.</variation> <variation>In frying, a little <ingredient>baking-powder</ingredient> put into the <ingredient>cracker dust</ingredient> will improve them.</variation> Roasting in the shell best preserves the natural flavor. Always serve immediately after cooking by any of the methods given. Lobsters and crabs should be boiled as soon as caught. The most humane way to kill them is to drop them in a kettle full of boiling water.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="soups">
<p>To make nutritious, healthful and palatable 
<purpose>soup,</purpose>
with flavors properly commingled, is an art which requires study and practice, but it is surprising from what a scant allotment of material a delicate and appetizing dish may be produced. The base of soup should always be <ingredient>lean uncooked meat,</ingredient> to which may be added <ingredient>chicken, turkey, beef, or mutton bones,</ingredient> well broken up. To four pounds of <ingredient>lean beef</ingredient> (the inferior parts are quite as good for this purpose), put five quarts of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> (soft is best), wash the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and put it in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> without salt; let it come slowly to boiling point, and then skim well, set it back and let it simmer gently for six or eight hours until the meat is in rags; rapid boiling hardens the fiber of the meat and the savory flavor escapes with the steam; add a little <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> strain into a stone jar, let it cool, and remove all the grease. This stock will keep for many days in cold weather, and from it can be made all the various kinds of soups by adding <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> <ingredient>macaroni,</ingredient> <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>asparagus,</ingredient> <ingredient>green pease,</ingredient> <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomato,</ingredient> <ingredient>okra,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> <ingredient>summer savory,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and slices of <ingredient>lemon;</ingredient> many of these may be first dried, then pulverized and put in cans or jars for winter use. <variation><ingredient>Celery</ingredient> and <ingredient>carrot seed</ingredient> may be used in place of the fresh vegetables.</variation> <variation>Macaroni should be first boiled in slightly <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> cut in pieces one or two inches long, and added a short time before serving.</variation> <variation>To prepare soup for dinner, cut off a slice of the <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> add <ingredient>water,</ingredient> heat and serve.</variation> <variation>Whatever is added to this, such as <ingredient>rice,</ingredient> <ingredient>tapioca,</ingredient> <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> etc., may first be cooked before being added, as much boiling injures the flavor of the stock.</variation> <variation>A rich stock can also be made from a <ingredient>shank or shin of beef</ingredient> <ingredient>(knuckle of veal</ingredient> is next best). Cut in several<pb n="266" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=273"/>pieces, crack the bones, add four quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and simmer until the liquor is reduced one-half; strain, cool and skim, and if boiled properly and long enough, an excellent jelly will result.</variation> Stock made from meat without bone or gristle, will not jelly, but will taste very like good beef-tea. Never boil vegetables with it, as they will cause it to become sour.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p>An 
<purpose>economical soup-stock</purpose>
may be made of <ingredient>steak or roast-beef bones,</ingredient> adding a little piece of <ingredient>fresh meat,</ingredient> or none at all, and allowing it to simmer at least five hours; strain, remove all fat the next day, and it will be ready for use.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p>
<purpose>To make soup from any stock,</purpose>
put on as much <ingredient>stock</ingredient> as needed (if in jelly, scrape the sediment from off the bottom), add <ingredient>seasoning,</ingredient> <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>vegetables.</ingredient> The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> should be peeled, sliced and laid in <ingredient>salt and water</ingredient> for half an hour, the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> parboiled and drained, and all others either sliced or cut fine before adding them to the soup; boil until thoroughly dissolved, strain through a <implement>colander</implement> and serve at once. Always use <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in making all soups; skim well, especially during the first hour. There is great necessity for thorough skimming, and to help the scum rise, pour in a little cold water now and then, and as the soup reaches the boiling point, skim it off. Use <ingredient>salt</ingredient> at first sparingly, and season with salt and <ingredient>pepper;</ingredient> allow one quart soup to three or four persons. Keep kettle covered closely, so that the flavor may not be lost, and simmer slowly, so that the quantity may not be much reduced by evaporation, but if it has boiled away (which may be the case when the meat is to be used for the table), pour in as much <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> as is needed, and add vegetables, <ingredient>noodles,</ingredient> or any <ingredient>thickening</ingredient> desired. Vegetables should be added just long enough before soup is done to allow them to be thoroughly cooked. Thickened soups require more <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> than thin soups; if wanted very clear and delicate, strain through a <implement>hair sieve.</implement> <variation>For a quick soup, crush the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> and cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> rather fine; when done, strain and serve.</variation> Every kitchen should be provided with a <implement>soup-kettle</implement> (which has a double bottom), or a large iron pot with a tight-fitting tin cover with a hole size of a large <implement>darning-needle</implement> in it at one side of the handle. <variation>
<purpose>For coloring and flavoring soups,</purpose>
use <ingredient>caramel,</ingredient> <ingredient>browned flour,</ingredient> <ingredient>onions</ingredient> fried brown, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> in it, or browned with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></variation><pb n="267" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=274"/>
<variation>Poached <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are an excellent addition to some soups. They should be added just before serving, one for each person. They may be poached in <ingredient>water</ingredient> or dropped into the boiling soup, or two or three eggs, well beaten and added just before pouring in <implement>tureen,</implement> make a nice thickening.</variation> <variation><ingredient>Cayenne pepper or a bit of red pepper pod,</ingredient> <ingredient>Worcestershire, Halford, or Chili sauce,</ingredient> and <ingredient>catsups,</ingredient> are considered by many an improvement to soup, but must be cautiously used.</variation> <variation><ingredient>Force-meat balls,</ingredient> made of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> boiled for the soup (chop fine, season with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley or onion,</ingredient> and bind together with a <ingredient>raw egg</ingredient> mixed with a little <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> make into balls and fry or boil before adding to soup), are also used.</variation></p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">POTATOES IN KENTUCKY STYLE.</purpose>
The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are sliced thin, as for frying, and allowed to remain in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> half an hour. The slices are then put into a <implement>pudding dish,</implement> with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and some <ingredient>milk</ingredient>--about half a pint to an ordinary <implement>pudding-dish.</implement> They are then put into an oven and baked for an hour.

Those who have never eaten potatoes cooked thus do not know all the capabilities of that esculent tuber. The slicing allows the interior of each potato to be examined, hence its value where potatoes are doubtful, though poor ones are not of necessity required. The soaking in cold water hardens the slices, so that they will hold their shape. The milk serves to cook them through, and to make a nice brown on the top; the quantity can only be learned by experience; if just a little is left as a rich gravy, moistening all the slices, then it is right. In a year of small and poor potatoes, this method of serving them will be very welcome to many a housekeeper.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. C. M. Nichols. Springfield.</contributor></p></recipe>

Too great profusion, especially of cakes, confectionary, and ices, is out of taste. Selections may be made from the following: Escaloped oysters; cold tongue, turkey, chicken, and ham, pressed meats, boned turkey, jellied chicken; sandwiches or wedding sandwich rolls; pickled oysters, chicken and lobster salads, cold slaw garnished with fried oysters; bottled pickles, French or Spanish pickles; jellies; charlotte-russe, ice-creams, ices; two large handsome cakes for decoration of table, and one or two baskets of mixed cake, fruit, layer, and sponge cake predominating; fruits; nuts; coffee, chocolate with whipped cream, lemonade.</p><p>REFRESHMENTS.--For small evening parties, sociables, receptions, etc., where the refreshments are handed round, and are of a simple character, every thing should be excellent in the highest degree, delicately prepared, and attractively served. Sandwiches and coffee, chocolate, or tea, a variety of nice cake, jellies, ice-cream or ices, and fruits are appropriate. For a more pretentious occasion, a simple table prettily decorated with flowers, and set with fruit, lobster salad, chicken croquettes, pickled oysters, and one or two kinds of ice-cream and cake, and coffee and tea is quite enough.</p><p>REFRESHMENTS FOR TWENTY.--For a company of twenty allow one gallon oysters, four chickens and eight bunches of celery for chicken salad, fifty sandwiches, one gallon of ice-cream, two molds charlotte-russe, two quarts<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=310"/>of lemon jelly, one light and one dark fruit cake, two layer cakes, and one white or sponge cake; for coffee use one and a half pints ground coffee and one gallon of water; fruit cake especially, and, indeed, all rich cake, should be cut in thin slices with a keen-edged knife; a small piece of each variety is always preferred to a plate overloaded with one or two kinds.</p><p>REFRESHMENTS FOR A HUNDRED.--For a larger company of a hundred the refreshments may be more elaborate: Two gallons of pickled oysters; two large dishes of lobster salad; two small hams boiled and sliced cold, five cold tongues sliced thin, twelve chickens jellied or pressed, each dish garnished with sprigs of parsley, slices of lemon and red beets, or curled leaves of celery, or the tender center leaves of lettuce; two gallons of bottled pickles or a gallon and a half of home-made; twelve dozen biscuit sandwiches; five quarts jelly, four gallons ice-cream; fifteen large cakes, to be made from recipes for rich fruit, delicate, layer, and sponge cakes; twelve dozen each of almond macaroons and variety puffs; four large dishes of mixed fruits; five pounds roasted coffee and five gallons water, which should be served at the beginning, and six gallons of iced lemonade to serve at the close.</p><p>REFRESHMENTS FOR ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE.--Six gallons oysters; three small hams, five large turkeys, ten tongues: six chickens and twelve bunches of celery for salad; three gallons pickles; seventeen dozen buns, twelve loaves bread made in wedding sandwich rolls or in plain sandwiches; twenty-two large cakes; fifteen dozen large oranges sliced, seventeen dozen meringues, fifteen dozen pears, thirty pounds grapes; seven gallons ice-cream and four gallons lemon ice; coffee made of twelve pints ground coffee and eight gallons water; serve coffee at the beginning, and lemonade at the close.</p><hd align="center">FOR THE PICNIC.</hd>
<p>In the "Sunny South," picnics are in order as early as April, but in the more northern latitudes should never be attempted before the latter part of May, or June, and September and October are the crowning months for them around the northern lakes, where hunting and fishing give zest to the sports. First, be up "at five o'clock in the morning," in order to have the chicken, biscuit, etc., freshly baked. Provide two baskets, one for the provisions, and the other for dishes and utensils, which should include the following: Table-cloth and an <implement>oil-cloth</implement> to put under it, napkins, towels, plates, cups, forks, a few knives and table-spoons, tea-spoons, <implement>sauce dishes,</implement> tin cups (or <implement>tumblers,</implement> if the picnickers are of the over-fastidious variety); a tin bucket, for water, in which a bottle of cream, lemons, oranges, or other fruit, may be carried to the scene of action; another with an extra-close cover, partly filled with made chocolate, which may be readily reheated by setting in an old tin pail or pan in which water is kept boiling <emph rend="italic">a la</emph> <implement>custard-kettle;</implement> a frying-pan; a <implement>coffee-pot,</implement> with the amount of prepared coffee needed tied in a coarse, white flannel bag; a tea-pot, with tea in a neat paper package; tin boxes of salt, pepper, and sugar; a tin box for butter (if carried) placed next to block of ice, which should be well wrapped with a blanket and put in a shady corner of the picnic wagon. For extra occasions, add a freezer filled with frozen cream, with ice well packed around it, and heavily wrapped with carpeting. To pack the basket, first put in plates, cups, and <implement>sauce dishes</implement> carefully with the towels and napkins, and paper if needed; then add the rest, fitting them in tightly, and covering all with the table-cloth, and over it the <implement>oil-cloth.</implement> Tie the coffee and tea-pots, well wrapped up, and the frying-pan to the handles. Pack provision basket as full as the law allows,<pb n="304" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=311"/>or as the nature of the occasion and the elasticity of the appetites demand. One piece of good advice to picnickers is to try to get under the wing of some good farm-house, where coffee may be boiled, and nice rich cream, green corn, good water, etc., may be readily foraged; and for a Fourth of July picnic, nothing will taste better than a dish of new potatoes, nicely prepared at the farm-house. But if not so fortunate, a good fire may be built, where all things may be merrily prepared. In fact, in the spring and fall, the fire is a necessity for roasting or broiling game, ham, clams, fish, corn and potatoes, etc.</p><p>A delicious way to roast potatoes, birds, or poultry, or even fish, is to encase them in a paste made of flour and water, and bake in the embers of a camp-fire; or build a fire over a flat stone, and when burnt down to coals, clear the stone, lay on the potatoes, birds, etc., wrapped in wet, heavy brown paper, cover with dry earth, sand, or ashes, and place the hot coals over these, adding more fuel. The Gypsies and Indians roast their poultry in mud molds or cases, covering feathers and all.</p><p>The following bills of fare may be picked to pieces and recombined to suit tastes and occasions:</p><p>SPRING PICNICS.--Cold roast chicken; ham broiled on coals; fish fried or broiled; sardines; tongue; hard-boiled eggs; eggs to be fried or scrambled; Boston corn bread; buttered rolls; ham sandwiches prepared with grated ham; orange marmalade; canned peaches; watermelon and beet sweet-pickles; euchered plums; variety or bottled pickles; chow-chow; quince or plum jelly; raspberry or other jams; Scotch fruit, rolled jelly, chocolate, Minnehaha, old-fashioned loaf, and marble cake; coffee, chocolate, tea; cream and sugar; salt and pepper; oranges.</p><p>SUMMER PICNICS.--Cold baked or broiled chicken; cold boiled ham; pickled salmon; cold veal loaf; Parker House rolls; light bread; box of butter; green corn boiled or roasted; new potatoes; sliced tomatoes; sliced cucumbers; French and Spanish pickles; peach and pear sweet-pickles; lemon or orange jelly; strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries; lemonade; soda-beer or raspberry vinegar; coffee and tea; ice-cream; lemon or strawberry-ice; sponge, white, Buckeye, or lemon cake; watermelon, muskmelon, nutmeg-melon.</p><p>FALL PICNICS.--Broiled prairie chicken; fish chowder; clam chowder; clams roasted or fried; beef omelet; cold veal roast; sardines; cold roast chicken; pot of pork and beans; rusk, Minnesota rolls, Boston brown bread; potatoes, Irish or sweet, roasted in ashes; egg sandwiches (hard-boiled eggs, sliced, sprinkled with pepper and salt, and put between buttered bread); mangoes; piccalilli; Chili sauce; quince marmalade; baked apples; musk and nutmeg-melon; crab apple jelly; grape jelly; black, orange, velvet, sponge, and three-ply cake; combination pie.</p></chapter>

<p>Mother's hash doesn't taste of soap grease, rancid butter, spoiled cheese, raw flour, boarding-house skillets, hotel coffee, garden garlics, bologna sausage, or cayenne pepper, neither is it stewed and simmered and simmered and stewed, but is made so nicely, seasoned so delicately, and heated through so quickly, that the only trouble is, "there is never enough to go round." <ingredient>Cold meat</ingredient> of any kind will do, but corned beef is best; always remove all surplus fat and bits of gristle, chop fine, and to one-third of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> add two-thirds of chopped <ingredient>cold boiled potato,</ingredient> and one <ingredient>onion</ingredient> chopped very fine; place in the <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> dredge with a little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and pour in at the side of the pan enough <ingredient>water</ingredient> to come up level with the hash, place in oven and do not stir; when the flour is a light brown, and has formed a sort of crust, take out, add a lump of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> stir it through several times, and you will have a 
<purpose>delicious hash.</purpose>
<variation>Or, by cooking longer, it may be made of <ingredient>cold raw potatoes,</ingredient> which peel, slice, and let lie in <ingredient>salt and water</ingredient> a half hour before chopping.</variation> If of meat and potatoes, always use the proportions given above, and, before chopping, season with pepper and salt, and a chopped onion if you like (if onions are not to be had, take them out of pickle jar), place in hot skillet with just enough <ingredient>water</ingredient> to moisten, add a little butter or some nice <ingredient>beef drippings,</ingredient> stir often until warmed through, cover and let stand on a moderately hot part of the stove fifteen minutes. When ready to dish, run the knife under and fold as you would an omelet, and serve hot with <ingredient>tomato catsup.</ingredient> In making hash, <ingredient>meats</ingredient> may be combined if there is not enough of a kind. Do not make hash or any other dish greasy. It is a mistaken idea to think that fat and butter in large quantities are necessary to good cooking. Butter and oils may be melted without changing their nature, but when cooked they become much more indigestible and injurious to weak stomachs.</p></recipe>

a most excellent hash may be made thus: Pick <ingredient>meat off turkey bones,</ingredient> shred it in small bits, add <ingredient>dressing</ingredient> and pieces of <ingredient>light biscuit</ingredient> cut up fine, mix together and put into <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> pour over any <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> that was left, add <ingredient>water</ingredient> to thoroughly moisten but not enough to make it sloppy, place in a hot oven for twenty minutes, and, when eaten, all will agree that the turkey is better this time than it was at first; <variation>or warm the remnants of the turkey over after the style of escaloped oysters (first a layer of <ingredient>bread-crumbs,</ingredient> then <ingredient>minced turkey,</ingredient> and so on);</variation> <variation>or add an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> or two and make nice breakfast croquettes.</variation> The common error in heating over <ingredient>meats</ingredient> of all kinds, is putting into a cold skillet, and cooking a long time. This second cooking is<pb n="322" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=317"/>more properly only heating, and should be quickly done.

is a problem many housekeepers never solve. Remember that grease is not gravy, neither is raw flour.

Put in a skillet, set in the oven or on top of the stove, stir often until it is a light brown, put into a wide-mouthed bottle, cork, and keep for use.</variation> All gravies should be well stirred over a rather hot fire, as they must be quickly made, and must boil, not simmer.</p></recipe>

<p>Mother has many other valuable ideas on how to stop the numberless little "leaks," which keep many a family in want, while a little care and economy in these minor details would insure a fair competency, but she thinks it better to have the ideas she has already given thoroughly digested before clogging them with others. She says a neat,clean home, a tidy table, and well cooked, palatable meals, are safeguards against the evils of the ale-house, the liquor saloon, and the gambling-table. So that we may, with our frying-pans and <implement>soup-kettles,</implement> wage a mighty war against intemperance, for seldom is a well-fed man a drunkard; and thus our attempts at palatable and economical cooking may "kill two birds with one stone."</p>
<p>By the way, she has just taken up a paper from which she reads this item by Prof. Blot: "Wasting is carried on so far and so far extensively in American kitchens that it will soon be one of the common sciences." "Just as I told you," says mother, as she folds her hands complacently together, looks down at the bright figures of the carpet, and repeats in her slow-measured way, "After all, whether we save or spend, the life is more than meat, and the body more than raiment."</p></chapter>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><pb n="332" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=327"/><hd align="center" placement="heading">HOUSEKEEPING.</hd><p>Housekeeping, whatever may be the opinion of the butterflies of the period, is an accomplishment in comparison to which, in its bearing on woman's relation to real life and to the family, all others are trivial. It comprehends all that goes to make up a well-ordered home, where the sweetest relations of life rest on firm foundations, and the purest sentiments thrive. It is an accomplishment that may be acquired by study and experiment, but the young and inexperienced housekeeper generally reaches success only through great tribulation. It ought to be absorbed in girlhood, by easy lessons taken between algebra, music and painting. If girls were taught to take as much genuine pride in dusting a room well, hanging a curtain gracefully, or broiling a steak to a nicety, as they feel when they have mastered one of Mozart's or Beethoven's grand symphonies, there would be fewer complaining husbands and unhappy wives. The great lesson to learn is that work well-done is robbed of its curse. The woman who is satisfied only with the highest perfection in her work, drops the drudge and becomes the artist. There is no dignity in slighted work, but to the artist, no matter how humble his calling, belongs the honor which is inseparable from all man's struggles after perfection. No mother who has the happiness of her daughter at heart, will neglect to teach her first the duties of the household, and no daughter who aspires to be queen at home and in her circle of friends, can afford to remain ignorant of the smallest details that contribute to the comfort, the peace and the attractiveness of home. There is no luck in housekeeping, however it may seem. Every thing works by exact rule, and even with thorough knowledge, eternal vigilance is the price of success. There must be a place for every thing and every thing in its place, a time for every thing and every thing in its time, and "patience, patience," must be written in glowing capitals all over the walls. The reward is sure. Your husband may admire your grace and ease in society, your wit, your school-day accomplishments of music and painting, but all in perfection will not atone for an ill-ordered kitchen, sour bread, muddy coffee, tough meats, unpalatable vegetables, indigestible pastry, and the whole train of horrors that result from bad housekeeping; on the other hand, success wins gratitude and attachment in the home circle, and adds luster to the most brilliant intellectual accomplishments.</p><p>One of the first ideas the young housekeeper should divest herself of is that because she is able or expects some time to be able to keep servants, it is therefore unnecessary to understand household duties, and to bear their responsibility. "Girls" are quick to see and note the ignorance or the incapacity of the mistress of the house, and few are slow to take whatever advantage <pb n="333" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=328"/>that brings them, but the capacity of a mistress at once establishes discipline. The model house should not be large, nor too fine and pretentious for daily use. The mistress of many a fine mansion is the veriest household drudge. A great house, with its necessary retinue of servants, is not in keeping with the simplicity of a republic where trained servants are not known, and is seldom pleasant for the family or attractive to friends. Furniture should be selected for comfort rather than show. Most modern chairs put their occupants to torture, and throw them into attitudes any thing but graceful. Comfortable chairs should have broad seats, and a part at least, low seats for women and children. Nothing is more out of taste and "shoddy" than to crowd rooms with furniture, no matter how rich or elegant it may be. Nor is it by any means necessary to have things in <emph rend="italic">suites</emph>; variety is preferable, and each room, especially, should have an individuality of its own. Just now the "Eastlake" style is in high favor, and perhaps there is danger of too strong a reaction from the "modern styles," most of which, however, are a hap-hazard collection of styles, without any unity of idea in them. The "Eastlake" is, in the main, a protest against the falsehoods and shams of modern fine furniture, and so far it is a real reform. In a table, for example, we usually have a foundation of pine, put together mostly with glue; this is covered with a veneer of mahogany, walnut, or other wood, and ornamented with carvings, which may mean something or nothing, and which are glued to the work. In a few years the pine framework warps and shrinks out of shape, the veneer peels, the carving gets chipped, and the whole becomes "shabby genteel." Eastlake and his associates would have the table <emph rend="italic">honest</emph>, and be throughout what it appears to be on the surface, hence the table is made solid; and if a costly wood can be afforded--well; if not, take a cheaper wood, but let the table be just what it pretends to be; if braces or bars are needed for strength, let them show, and indicate why they are used; and if ornament is desirable, let it be worked in the material, and not glued on. A table of this kind will <emph rend="italic">last</emph>, and may serve for several generations. Finding that our ancestors of a few centuries ago understood the matter of furniture better than the cabinet-makers of the present, Eastlake and the others reproduced many of the styles of bygone times, and with some dealers "Eastlake" is used for antique. But the matter does not depend so much upon antiquity of style, as solidity, honesty, and appropriateness. Sets are made of plain woods, such as ash and walnut, inlaid with procelain tiles, and ornamented with old-fashioned brass rings and handles. They are valued at from thirty to two hundred and fifty dollars. Bedroom sets of French and English walnut, with inlaid woods, gilt and bronze ornaments, and variegated marbles, are sold from thirty-five to fifteen hundred dollars. Parlor sets of rich, carved woods, and satin, damask, cashmere, brocade, and tapestry coverings, etc., range in price from one hundred to twelve hundred dollars. Ebony cabinets inlaid with ivory,<pb n="334" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=329"/>
and richly ornamented, are worth from two to eighteen hundred dollars. Marquetry tables, work tables, library tables, Oriental chairs, lounges, easels, music-racks, etc., of rich material and design, are valued at from ten to one hundred and fifty dollars. The principal woods used are walnuts of various kinds, ash, bird's-eye maple, satinwood, and kingwood. Kingwood is almost crimson in color. Book-cases are of all prices from twenty to fourteen hundred dollars, and sideboards from seventy-five to one thousand dollars. It is a good rule in selecting furniture, not to buy any thing not actually needed, to buy the best of its kind, and to pay cash or not buy. Never get any thing because some one else has it, and do not be afraid to wait for bargains. Wise young housekeepers buy furniture in single pieces or small lots, as they have means, rather than expend more than they can afford in entire sets, which are really less attractive.</p><p>Carpets should as a rule be of small pattern. The stoves--if grates or fire-places are not used--should be of the kind that may be thrown open or closed at pleasure. If a furnace is used, great care must be taken that the rooms are not kept too hot in winter, and that there is most thorough ventilation, as the health of the family depends as much on the quality of the air they breathe as the food they eat. To waste heat is not so bad as to waste health and vigor, and fuel is always cheaper, on the score of economy, than doctors' bills. In furnace-heated houses--and the furnace seems to be accepted as the best <implement>heater,</implement> though apparatus for steam and hot water seems likely to be so perfected as to supplant it by furnishing a milder and more agreeable heat, entirely free from noxious gases--there should always be grates or fire-places in living or sleeping rooms; and whenever the furnace heat is turned on, there should be a little fire, at least enough to start the column of air in the chimney and secure ventilation. Without fire, chimneys are apt to draw down a current of cold air. If there are no grates or fire-places, do not rely on airing rooms from the halls, but throw open the windows and take in the outside air. This is especially necessary when a room is used as a study, or for an invalid. The air from the halls, although cold, is not pure. House-plants will not thrive in furnace-heated houses where gas is burned, and human beings, especially the young and delicate, need quite as pure air as plants. In a study, or other room much occupied, the windows may be dropped during meals, and the room warmed anew before it is needed again. There must also be plenty of sunlight, floods of it in every room, even if the carpets do fade; and the housekeeper must be quick to note any scent of decay from vegetables or meats in the cellar, or from slops or refuse carelessly thrown about the premises. Every room must be clean and sweet. In sickness, care in all these respects must be doubled. In damp and chill autumn and spring days, a little fire is comfortable morning and evening. The food for the family must be fresh to be wholesome, and it is economy to buy the best as there is less waste in it. No housekeeper<pb n="335" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=330"/>ought to be satisfied with any but the very best cooking, without which the most wholesome food is unpalatable and distressing; and no considerations of economy should ever induce her to place on the table bread with the slightest sour tinge, cake or pudding in the least heavy or solid, or meat with the slightest taint. Their use means disease and costly doctor's bills, to say nothing of her own loss of repute as an accomplished housekeeper. If children and servants do work improperly, she should quietly insist on its being done correctly, and in self-defense they will soon do it correctly without supervision. Order and system mean the stopping of waste, the practice of economy, and additional means to expend for the table and for the luxuries and elegancies of life--things for which money is well expended. It requires good food to make good muscle and good brain, and the man or woman who habitually sits down to badly cooked or scanty dinners, fights the battle of life at a great disadvantage.</p>
<section><hd align="center">THE PARLOR.</hd><p>The sweeping and dusting of a parlor seems simple enough, but is best done systematically. "Dusters," made of old prints, with which to cover books, statuettes, and such articles as are difficult to dust, and larger ones to cover beds, are indispensable in sweeping and dusting. "Carpet sweepers" are only fit for daily use, when thorough work is not required, a thorough sweeping once or twice a week sufficing even the tidiest of housekeepers. Before sweeping open the blinds and let in the light, and open the windows if it is not storming or too windy. Look on the ceiling for cobwebs, and sprinkle the carpet over with moistened bran, salt, damp coffee-grounds, or tea-leaves. Clean the corners and edges with a sharp-pointed stick and stiff <implement>whisk-broom.</implement> Brush down with the feather-duster all picture-cords, frames, and curtains, and remove all cobwebs; then clear one corner of furniture and begin sweeping toward the center with a short, light stroke, going slowly and carefully so as to raise no dust, and drawing, not pushing, the broom. The second time over, increase the length and force of the stroke, and the third, brush with long and vigorous strokes, using care as the dirt at the center of the room is approached. In this way it will take twenty minutes to sweep a large room, but it will be <emph rend="italic">clean</emph>, and the carpet will wear, bright and fresh, much longer than if the dirt were allowed to grind out the fabric. After the sweeping remove the "dusters" carefully, carrying them out of doors to shake, and rub, not simply wipe, off the furniture and other articles with a clean, soft, cotton cloth or an old silk handkerchief, or better a soft dusting-towel with fleecy surface which is sold expressly for this purpose, folding the dust in as it soils the cloth, and when it is filled with dust, shake thoroughly out of doors. Managed in this way, curtains, furniture and carpets will never be loaded with dust, but will remain bright, clean and fresh from one year's house-cleaning to another's. If any<pb n="336" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=331"/>spot of dust is too firmly fixed, wash in lukewarm soap-suds, and immediately rub dry with <implement>chamois-skin.</implement> If there is open-work carving, draw the cloth through, or dust with a paint-brush; and it will be found more convenient to blow out some of the places which are difficult to reach, for which purpose a small pair of <implement>bellows</implement> may be used. To clean and dust a piano, use half a yard best canton-flannel with a nap free from all specks and grit, brushing lightly over to remove the dust; if there are finger-marks or spots, rub up and down over them, always keeping the nap next to the instrument. Dust under the wires may be blown out with a pair of <implement>bellows.</implement> Keep the piano closed at night and in damp weather; open on bright days, and if possible let the sun shine directly upon the keys, as the light will keep them from turning yellow. Tune every spring and fall. As a last finishing touch to the rearranging of the parlor, leave late papers, magazines, a volume of poetry, or a stereoscope and views, where they will be readily picked up by callers.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">THE SITTING ROOM.</hd><p>The sitting-room should be the pleasantest, because most used, of all in the house. Do not put down a Brussels carpet here, because it is too hard to sweep and holds too much dust. To prevent moths under the carpets, grind black pepper coarsely, mix with camphor-gum, and strew thickly about the edges and wherever they are to be found. To clean the <implement>oil-cloth,</implement> use warm water without soap, or what is much better, milk and water. By keeping mats at the doors it will only be necessary to sweep the sitting-room thoroughly once a week, but occasionally when very dusty it may be cleaned by setting a pail of cold water by the door, wet the broom in it, knock off the drops, sweep a yard or so, then wash the broom as before and sweep again, being careful to shake all the drops off the broom, and not to sweep far at a time. If done with care the carpet will be very nicely cleaned, and the quantity of dirt in the water will be surprising. The water must be changed several times. Snow sprinkled on and swept off before it has had time to melt, is also nice for renovating a soiled carpet. A scrap bag hung on the end of the sewing machine, for storing all bits of cloth and ravelings, and ends of thread, will save much sweeping. In summer, wire doors and mosquito-nettings in the windows will keep flies out, and at the same time admit the air. Washing windows and wiping off doors once a week after sweeping, keeps all tidy. To remove finger-marks, which are constantly appearing on doors about the knobs, use a damp cloth as soon as they are observed.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">THE BED-ROOM.</hd><p>The family bed-room should be on the first floor if possible, if the house is properly built and there is no dampness. Matting is better for the floor<pb n="337" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=332"/>than carpet, because freer from dust, and this is the room used in case of sickness. If made properly it will wear for several years. Canton mattings are made on boats in pieces about two yards long, and afterward joined on shore into pieces of fifty yards. It is easy to see where these short pieces are joined; after cutting into lengths, first sew these places across and across on the wrong side, then sew the breadths together and tack down like a carpet. Matting should never be washed with any thing except moderately-warmed salt and water, in the proportion of a pint of salt to a half pail of soft water. Dry quickly with a soft cloth. A bed-room matting should be washed twice during the season, a room much used, oftener. In this room there should be a medicine closet, high above the reach of children, where are kept camphor, hot drops, mustard, strips of old linen, etc., for sudden sickness or accident. There should also be a large closet, a part of which is especially set apart for children's use, with low hooks where they may hang their clothes, a box for stockings, a bag for shoes, and other conveniences, which will help to teach them system and order. The bedding should be the best that can be afforded. The inner husks of corn make a good under-bed. Oat-straw is also excellent. Mattresses of Spanish moss are cheaper than hair, but soon mat down. A mattress made of coarse wool is quite as nice as hair, and as serviceable. When the woven-wire bed is used, a light mattress is all that is needed; and this combination makes the healthiest and best bed, because it affords the most complete exposure of the bedding to air. The best covering is soft woolen blankets. Comforters made of cotton should be used with great caution, as they need to be frequently exposed to sun and air. The best comforter is made of delaines, which may be partly worn, with wool instead of cotton quilted in. Beds are almost always made up too early. The thrifty housekeeper likes to have rooms put to rights in the morning, but it brings up the old adage of "the white glove" which "hides a dirty hand." The bed should lie open for several hours every morning, and at least once a week all the bedding should be thoroughly aired. Air pillows in wind but not in sun.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">THE GUEST-CHAMBER.</hd><p>The bed of the guest-chamber should always stand so that when one opens the eyes in the morning, the light from the window will not be directly upon them, as it is trying to weak eyes, and unpleasant to strong ones. Keep the bureau where the sun's rays will never strike the mirror, and where it will not be heated by the stove, as either will granulate the amalgam. Chambers should always be provided with transoms over the doors, and windows arranged so as to lower easily from the top. A light feather-bed covered with a case like a pillow, may be either used over the mattress, or a comfort may be used over it and the feather-beds under it. Tacked on the inside of the washstand-doors, two crotcheted pockets are nice for bathing sponges, and<pb n="338" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=333"/>there should be plenty of towels, especially of those coarse, rough ones which make a morning bath such a luxury. A broad <implement>oil-cloth</implement> in front of the washstand is also a protection to the carpet in bathing, and is needed when there is no bath-room up stairs.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">HOUSE-CLEANING.</hd><p>When mother earth summons the stirring winds to help clear away the dead leaves and winter litter for the coming grass and flowers, every house-keeper has a feeling of sympathy, and begins to talk of house-cleaning. The first bright sunshine of spring reveals unsuspected dust and cobwebs, and to her imagination even the <implement>scrubbing-brushes</implement> and brooms seem anxious to begin the campaign. In northern latitudes it is best, however, not to begin too soon. Do not trust entirely to appearances, for spring is almost certain to break her promises of pleasant weather, and give us a good many days when it will be any thing but pleasant to sit shivering in a fireless room, while the children become unmanageable and husband growls. So for the sake of health, peace, and comfort do not remove the stoves before the middle of May. When you begin, do not upset all the house at once, driving your husband to distraction, and the children to the neighbors. By cleaning one or two rooms at a time, and using a little womanly tact, the whole house may be renovated with little inconvenience. Before the trouble begins see that all repairs needed about the house, from cellar to garret, are attended to. Have all tools on hand and in good order, and provide lime for white-washing, carpet-tacks, good soap, sawdust, carbolic acid, and spirits of ammonia. Fold carpets by lifting one side, carrying it over to the other and laying it down carefully, thus preventing the straw and dust from the under side from soiling the upper. Carry it out, and hang on a strong line over the grass, and beat thoroughly the wrong side first, with a carpet-whip such as are sold at all house-furnishing stores, or a broom or stick, taking care not to use any thing rough that will catch into the carpet. Wash out all grease spots with a little gall soap and clean water, after the dust is entirely beaten out. Take one or two pails of sawdust, wet thoroughly and scatter well over the floor; a very little dust will arise when you sweep it off, and it will not be necessary to clean the floor before washing wood-work and windows. If you can not get sawdust, use moist earth instead. Begin at the attic and work down to the cellar; clothes, carpeting, and "trumpery" stowed away, must be thoroughly dusted and aired in sunshine and wind. Brush down all cobwebs with a long-handled broom, and sweep down the walls carefully. Wash and polish the windows, and if the walls are hard-finish, they may be washed off lightly with soap-suds, and wiped dry. Wash wood-work and floors with hot soap-suds, and rinse with strong, hot brine, or hot water with a strong mixture of cayenne pepper in it, to drive out mice, rats, and other vermin. When the floor is dry, blow cayenne<pb n="339" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=334"/>pepper into every crack and crevice, using a small pair of <implement>bellows</implement> for the purpose; and the room is ready for its customary furniture, unless the more thorough renovation of kalsomining and painting is to follow the cleaning. Before replacing, every article should be thoroughly cleaned, every button and tuft of the upholstered goods receiving its share of attention from the furniture-brush. Sofas and chairs should be turned down and whipped, then carefully brushed, and all dust wiped off with a clean cloth slightly damped. Wash wood-work and carving with a soft cloth dipped in warm soap-suds, <emph rend="italic">wiping it off quickly</emph>, and polishing with chamois-leather, to prevent the soap from injuring the varnish. When it needs it, black walnut or mahogany furniture may be washed quickly with a soft brush and soapy water, wiped dry, and then rubbed with an oily cloth. To polish it, rub it with rotten-stone and sweet oil. Clean off the oil, and polish with <implement>chamois-skin.</implement></p><p>Sinks, drains, and all places that become sour or impure, should be cleansed with carbolic acid and water. This is the best disinfectant known, and should be kept in every house, and used frequently in warm weather. While house-cleaning, brighten up old furniture by rubbing well with kerosene oil; should it be marred or bruised use the "Magic Furniture Polish," page 342. Take bedsteads to pieces, and saturate every crevice with strong brine; nothing is better to purify and cleanse, or to destroy bedbugs. To clean mirrors, take clean warm rain-water, and put in just enough spirits of ammonia to make it feel slippery. If very dirty, rinse, if not, wipe dry, and you will be surprised at the effect. Do not polish stoves until fall if you are going to put them away during the summer, but to keep them or any iron utensils from rusting, rub over with kerosene. When polishing, six or eight drops of turpentine added to blacking for one stove, brightens it and makes it easier to polish. To remove mortar and paint from windows, rub spots of mortar with hot, sharp vinegar; or if nearly fresh, cold vinegar will loosen them. Rub the paint spots with camphene and sand. To clean paint use whiting on a damp cloth. To remove spots from gray marble hearths rub with linseed oil.</p><p>Fall house-cleaning deserves no less attention, except that white-washing and painting can best be done in the mild days of spring, when the house may be thrown open to wind and sunshine. The best time is in the constant weather of October; and before beginning, all the dirty and heavy work for the winter, such as getting in coal and wood, should be completed, and the cellar made clean and sweet.</p></section>

<section><hd align="center">PAINTING.</hd><p>Any woman of a mechanical turn of mind can paint a room, buying the paint ready mixed. While painting keep the room well ventilated and eat acid fruits. When done, any spatters on the glass may be removed by the application of a mixture of equal parts of ammonia and turpentine, washed off with soap-suds. To polish the glass, wash in warm water, wipe with a soft cloth, put a little whiting on the center of the pane, and rub with <implement>chamois-skin</implement> or a soft cloth.

<p><hd align="center">PAPERING.</hd>
In papering a hard finished wall a thin solution of <ingredient>white glue</ingredient> should be first applied with a white-wash brush. <variation>
<purpose>To make the paste,</purpose>
sift the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> add one ounce <ingredient>pulverized alum</ingredient> to every pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mix it smoothly with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and pour over it gently but quickly <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> stirring meantine constantly.

It is well to use a small quantity of <ingredient>carbolic acid</ingredient> in it, as a precaution against vermin.</variation> <variation>A thin <ingredient>paste of wheat,</ingredient> or what is better, <ingredient>rye flour,</ingredient> is, however, very good for any thing except the most delicate papers.</variation> The wall should be smooth, and if very smoky or greasy in spots, it should be washed with weak lye or soap-suds. Trim the paper close to the pattern on one side. A pair of long shears is best for the purpose--allowing the roll to lie on the floor, and rolling up again on the lap as fast as trimmed. Provide a board wider than the paper, and a little longer than a single breadth when cut. Cut all the full breadths that will be required for the room, matching as you cut, and saving remnants for door and window spaces. Begin at the right hand and work to the left. The breadths may be laid one on another on the board, the top one pasted with a good brush, the top turned down bringing the two pasted sides together, a foot or two<pb n="341" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=336"/>
from the other end. Carefully adjust the top to its place, gently pressing it with soft towels, first down the middle of the breadth and then to each edge. In turning a corner, paste only that part which belongs to one side, fasten it in place, and then paste and adjust the rest. In selecting paper avoid contrasts in colors and large staring patterns, as they are out of taste and tiresome to the eye. Choose rather neutral tints and colors that harmonize and blend agreeably together, and with the general tone of carpets and furniture. Even with a bare floor and plain wooden chairs, the effect of a soft-tinted paper gives a vastly different impression than if the wall is disfigured with glaring figures and contrasting colors. If ceilings are low, heighten the appearance by a figure which runs perpendicularly through the wall-paper; the effect produced is very deceptive, the ceiling appearing much higher than it really is. Wall-paper is half a yard wide, and about eight yards to the roll, so that it is easy to estimate the quantity needed. It is wise always to get one extra roll for repairs. After papering a room build no fire in it until dry.</p></formula>

--Boil ten pounds <ingredient>stone lime,</ingredient> five gallons <ingredient>water</ingredient> and one pound <ingredient>flour of sulphur,</ingredient> let settle, pour off clear part, and sprinkle freely upon the weedy walks.</p></formula>
<p>TO RETOUCH A GILT FRAME.--Wet the rubbed spot with isinglass dissolved in weak spirits. When about dry, lay on gold leaf, and when quite dry, polish with a very hard burnisher.</p><p>TO MEND TIN.--Scrape the tin about the hole free from grease and rust, rub on a piece of resin until a powder lies about the hole, over it lay a piece of solder, and hold on it a hot <implement>poker</implement> or soldering iron until it melts.</p><p>TO TEMPER LAMP CHIMNEYS.--Lamp chimneys and glass-ware for hot water is made less liable to break by putting in cold water, bringing slowly to boiling point, boiling for an hour, and allowing to cool before removing from water.</p><p>TO KEEP AWAY MOTHS FROM FURS.--Dust furs with powdered alum, working it well in at the roots of the hair. Do not air woolen articles and furs in the summer sunshine. They should be put aside in the early spring, and left untouched until October.</p><p>TO CLEAN FURNITURE.--Take a large cotton rag well saturated with coal oil, rub each article of furniture with it until all the mud-stains and dust have disappeared, then go over it with a dry cloth, rubbing each piece until it is perfectly dry. Clean once a week.</p><p>A CHEAP CARPET.--Make a cover for the floor of the cheapest cotton cloth. Tack it down like a carpet, paper it as you would a wall with paper resembling a carpet in figures, let it dry, varnish with two coats of varnish, and with reasonable usage it will last two years.</p><p>MENDING PLASTER OF PARIS.--Gum shellac makes an excellent strong cement for joining broken pieces together, and is more convenient than glue. The shellac should be flowed upon the surfaces to be joined, firmly pressed together, and carefully set away for about one hour.</p><p>TO MAKE RAG RUGS.--Cut rags and sew hit and miss, or fancy-striped as you choose; use wooden needles, round, smooth, and pointed at one end, of any convenient length. The knitting is done back and forth (like old fashioned suspenders), always taking off the first stitch.<contributor rend="italic">--Anna F. Hisey.</contributor></p><p>TO START A FIRE IN DAMP, STILL WEATHER.--Light a few bits of shavings or paper placed upon the top of grate; thus by the heated air's forcing itself into the chimney and establishing there an upward current, the room is kept free from the gas and smoke which is so apt to fill it, and the fire can then be lighted from below with good success.</p><p>A CHEAP FILTER.--The most impure water may be rendered pure by filtering through charcoal. Take a large flower-pot, put a piece of sponge or clean moss over the hole in the bottom, fill three-quarters full of equal parts clean sand and charcoal, the size of a pea; over this lay a linen or woolen cloth large enough to hang over the sides of the pot. Pour the water into the cloth, and it will come out pure.</p><p>TO PRESERVE BOOKS.--Bindings may be preserved from mildew by brushing them over with spirits of wine. A few drops of any perfumed oil will secure libraries from the consuming effects of mold and damp. Russia leather which is perfumed with the tar of the birch-tree, never molds or sustains injury from damp. The Romans used oil of cedar to preserve valuable manuscripts. Russia-leather covered books, placed in a stationer's window will destroy flies and other insects.</p><p>A RUSTIC FRAME.--A neat rustic frame for pictures may be made of cattail<pb n="345" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=340"/>rods. Hide the corners where they are joined with ivy, or a vine made of leather-leaves or handsome autumn leaves and the berries of bitter-sweet.</p>

After it has been applied to the glass and metal, clamp together for two or three days, till dry.</p></formula>
<p>TO CLEAN A PAPERED WALL.--Cut into eight pieces a large loaf of bread two days old, blow dust off wall with a <implement>bellows,</implement> rub down with a piece of the bread in half yard strokes, beginning at the top of room, until upper part is cleaned, then go round again, repeating until all has been gone over. If done carefully, so that every spot is touched, the paper will look almost like new. Dry corn meal may be used instead of bread, applying it with a cloth.</p>

<p>
<purpose>A GOOD CEMENT</purpose>
--For mending almost any thing, may be made by mixing <ingredient>litharge</ingredient> and <ingredient>glycerine</ingredient> to the consistency of thick cream or fresh putty. This cement is useful for mending stone jars, stopping leaks in seams of tin-pans or <implement>wash-boilers,</implement> cracks and holes in iron kettles, fastening on lamp-tops; in all cases the article mended should not be used till the cement has hardened. This cement will resist the action of water, hot or cold, acids, and almost any degree of heat.</p></formula>
<p>BADLY FITTING DOORS.--When blinds and doors do not close snugly, but leave cracks through which drafts enter, the simplest remedy is this: Place a strip of putty all along the jambs, cover the edge of the blind or door with chalk, and shut it. The putty will then fill all spaces which would remain open and be pressed out where it is not needed, while the excess is easily removed with a knife. The chalk rubbed on the edges prevents adhesion and the putty is left in place, where it soon dries and leaves a perfectly fitting jamb.</p>

The writing must be exposed to a hot sun for twelve hours; do not wash for one week, then be particular to get out the stain which the preparation will make. If this is followed in every particular, there need never be a failure. <variation><purpose>Gum-water</purpose> for the above is composed of two drams <ingredient>gum-arabic</ingredient> to four ounces <ingredient>water.</ingredient> One tea-spoon makes two drams, two table-spoons make one ounce.</variation> If at any time the ink becomes too pale add a little of pure lunar caustic.

<p>TO REMOVE GREASE FROM WOOD BEFORE PAINTING.--Whitewash the<pb n="346" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=341"/>spots over night, and wash it off in the morning. When dry, the paint will stick. Slaked lime laid on the spots and wet a little, will do as well as whitewash.</p><p>LAMP-WICKS.--To insure a good light, wicks must be changed often, as they soon become clogged, and do not permit the free passage of the oil.</p><p>STAIR CARPETS.--Will wear much longer if extra thicknesses of paper are placed over the edge of each stair, the full width of the carpet, before fastening down.</p><p>TO CLEAN LOOKING GLASSES.--Divide a newspaper in two, fold up one half in a small square, wet it in cold water. Rub the glass first with the wet half of the paper, and dry with the other. Fly-specks and all other marks will disappear as if by magic.</p><p>TO KEEP ICE-WATER.--Make a hat-shaped cover of two thicknesses of strong brown paper with cotton-batting quilted between, large enough to drop over and completely envelop the pitcher. This prevents the warm air from coming in contact with the pitcher, and the ice will last a long time.</p><p>FINISH FOR ROOM.--A room with plain white walls is finished beautifully by placing a black walnut (or the same wood with which the room is finished) molding, around the room where the border of paper is usually placed, at the junction of wall and ceiling. The molding, finished in oil, costs from one to five cents a foot, and is easily put up. The upper edge should be rounded, and a space of a quarter inch left between it and ceiling. To hang pictures, buy an S hook, sold at all hardware stores, place one hook over the molding, hang the picture cord on the other, and slip to the right or left to the desired position. This saves the wall from injury from picture-nails.</p>

<p>THE CARE OF MARBLE.--Never wash the marble tops of wash-stands<pb n="347" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=342"/>bureaus, etc., with soap. Use clean warm water (if very much soiled add a little ammonia) and a soft cloth, drying immediately with a soft towel. There is nothing that will <emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> remove grease spots from marble, hence the necessity of avoiding them. To clean marble or marbleized slate mantels, use a soft sponge or <implement>chamois-skin,</implement> dampened in clean warm water <emph rend="italic">without soap,</emph> then polish with dry <implement>chamois-skin.</implement> In dusting, use a feather-duster, and never a cloth, as it is likely to scratch the polished surface. Slate hearths are preferable to marble, as they are not so easily soiled. To wash them, use a clean cloth and warm water. Many oil them thoroughly when new with linseed oil; thus prepared they never show grease spots.<contributor rend="italic">--G. W. Herrick, Minneapolis, Minn.</contributor></p><p>LAYING CARPETS.--A carpet wears better if put down well, and it is better to have it done by experienced persons when the expense can be afforded and such help can be had. Lay down coarse paper or newspapers evenly on floor first; begin at one corner, and nail down one of the sides at the <emph rend="italic">cut ends</emph> of the breadths, continuing round the selvage side, and stretching it evenly and firmly without straining the fabric. When two sides are nailed, take next the other selvage side. The last side will require the most stretching in order to get rid of puckers.</p>

<p>MOVING.--When about to move to another house, begin packing two weeks beforehand. Carefully pack small and fragile articles in boxes and barrels. In this way china, and glassware, and fragile ornaments may be stowed away with odd articles of clothing, bedding, etc. Books should be packed in boxes, or wrapped several in a package, in several thicknesses of newspaper, and tied with strong twine. They can thus be transported with very little handling. Larger pictures should be taken down and tied in couples, face to face, with rolls of soft paper between the corners to prevent rubbing. Small pictures may be packed with clothing in bureau-drawers and trunks. Take up carpets last. When about ready to move select one room up-stairs into which remove every thing possible from the other rooms, and another below for the same purpose. If the occupant of the house into which you are to move will do the same, you can easily make some rooms there ready for occupancy. Of course each room must be swept down and scrubbed. As soon as the floors are dry, carpets may be put down in the more important rooms, and the furniture moved in. On the day the transfer is made, see that coal or fuel is provided, so that a fire may be started, and take along a basket with matches, towels, napkins, knives and forks, sugar, tea, bread, and other materials for lunching. With all the caution you can exercise, you will find Franklin's old saying true, that "three removes are as bad as a fire."</p><p>ECONOMICAL MATS.--For use in front-doors, fire-places, bureaus, stands, etc., may be made of coffee-sacking, cut to any desired size, and worked in bright worsted or Germantown wool. Any simple pattern may be used, or<pb n="348" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=343"/>it may be entirely filled in with a plain green. The edges of the sacking may be fringed by raveling. To give it weight, line with an old piece of carpet or heavy cloth.</p><p>TO WASH DISHES FOR SECOND COURSE.--When spoons or dishes, used in any course at dinner, will be needed also for the next, have a pan of hot soap-suds, and a dish-cloth or mop, and a clean towel ready in some convenient place in kitchen or pantry, so that they may be quickly washed and wiped.</p><p>LABOR-SAVING CONTRIVANCES.--Every good housewife has neatly arranged cupboard and dish-closet. Every thing has its appropriate shelf and division. But there are other things for which provision should be made. A pile of books is sometimes seen in one part of the dining-room, a few newspapers in another, and a pair of shoes in a third. The inside of a closet is sometimes a mass of confusion--"a place for every thing," and every thing thrown promiscuously into it. Half a dozen garments are hung upon one nail, to crowd each other out of shape; others are thrown upon the floor amid heaps of boots and shoes. And so on to the end of the chapter of careless and slovenly disorder. There is no excuse for such carelessness, and no satisfaction in such housekeeping. Want of time is no excuse, for such want of system and order is the cause of the most prodigal waste of time. It is only necessary to use the brain a little to save the hands. Systematic habits, doing every thing well, and the hundred little contrivances which will suggest themselves to every neat and ingenious housekeeper, will save time, and establish order and cleanliness. Have shelves in the closet, and regular rows of hooks and plenty of them; let one side be appropriated to one kind of clothing, with a hook for each article. If necessary to preserve the order, make a neat label, and paste over each hook. Make shoe-pockets (these pockets are made of about two and a half yards of calico; one yard of which makes the back, to be tacked to the door when done. Split the remaining yard and a half in two, lengthwise, and, placing the strips about one inch apart, make, across the back, three rows of pockets, by stitching first the ends of the strips to the sides of the back, and then gather the bottom of each strip to fit the back; then separate each strip into two, three, or four pockets, according to the use for which they are designed, and fasten by switching a narrow "piping" of calico, from top to bottom of the back, between the pockets. All the work may be done on a machine. A border of leather, stitched on the edges of the back, and a narrow strip used instead of the calico "piping," make whole much stronger) on the inside of the doors, and never put any thing on the closet floor, where it will be trodden upon in entering for other articles. Never stuff any thing away out of sight in haste and disorder. Hiding dirtiness does not cure it. Those who write many letters should have a case, with "pigeon-holes" labeled and arranged alphabetically--a box for three or four letters is sufficient--in which to keep them, with one compartment for unanswered letters. When the case becomes crowded, or at the end of the year, wrap in packages, and label with letter and the year. Newspapers and magazines, when preserved, should be neatly filed in order and laid away, or sent away for binding. The work-basket, which is in daily use, is often a spectacle for gods and men--the very picture of confusion and disorder. When it can be afforded, one of the new ladies' adjustable work-tables, of which several admirable styles are made and widely advertised, will be found a great convenience; especially where there are children--whose little fingers delight in tumbling the contents of the basket. If a basket is used, it should be divided into compartments. A circular basket, with divisions about the edge for smaller articles, and larger spaces in the center, is convenient, and easily kept in order. All these, and hundreds<pb n="349" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=344"/>Of other devices like them, are labor-savers, which relieve housekeeping of a large share of its burdens. And a calculation of the time spent every year in hunting through closets for lost over-shoes or slippers, or in cleaning up the scattered items in the sitting-room when company is coming in, and searching for missing letters among a miscellaneous pile thrown into a drawer, will give a startling result, and convey some adequate idea of the real money and time-value of that love of neatness and order which is one of the cardinal virtues in women.</p></section>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"> <pb n="350" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=345"/><hd align="center" placement="heading">THE DINING-ROOM.</hd><p>It may not be amiss to give a page or two to the observances of formal dinners in "society," lest some reader--who may hope, if she becomes the rare housekeeper we expect, to be called to give such dinners as the wife of a Congressman, Governor, or even as mistress of the White House itself--should be taken unawares. In every house, great or small, the Dining Room should be as bright, cheerful and cosey as possible, and at the table The mistress should wear her brightest smile. If there are trials and troubles, do not bring them to the table. They impair digestion, and send husband and children out to business or school, glum and gloomy, instead of refreshed and strengthened. The plainest room may be made beautiful by taste, and the homeliest fare appetizing by neatness and skill. Little attentions to the decoration or pretty arrangement of the table charm the eye and whet the appetite, and make the home table powerfully attractive. The every-day observance of sensible and simple table manners ought always to be encouraged, because in the long run it promotes the comfort and the cultivation of the family, and takes the pain of embarassment out of state occasions. Above all, the room, the table, and its furniture should be scrupulously neat and orderly. For formal dinners, a round table, five to seven feet in diameter, is the best fitted to display the dinner and its fine wares, but the extension table, about four feet wide and of any length desired, is generally used. At the round table, conversation is, of course, easily made general, the party being small. The table-cloth must be spotless, and an under-cover of white cloth or baize gives the linen a heavier and finer appearance. A center-piece of flowers is a pretty ornament (some even place upon the table a handsome vase filled with growing plants in bloom), but the flowers must be few and rare, and of delicate odors. Fruit in variety and tastefully arranged with green leaves, and surrounded with choice <implement>dessert dishes,</implement> is always attractive and elegant. It is also a pretty custom to place a little bouquet by the side of each lady's plate, and to fold a bunch of three or four flowers in the napkin of each gentleman, to be attached to the left lapel of the coat as soon as seats are taken at the table. Napkins, which should never be starched, are folded and laid upon the plates, with a small piece of bread or a cold roll placed on the top, or half concealed by the last fold. Beside each plate are placed as many knives, forks and spoons as will be needed in all the courses, (unless the lady prefers to have them brought with each new plate, which makes more work and confusion), and a glass, to be filled with fresh water just before dinner is announced. The plates which will be needed are<pb n="351" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=346"/>counted out. Such as are to be filled with ready-prepared <implement>dessert-dishes</implement> are filled and set in a convenient place. Dishes that need to be warm, not hot, are left on the top shelf of the range or elsewhere where they will be kept warm until needed. When the <implement>soup-tureen</implement> (with the soup at the boiling point) and the <implement>soup-plates</implement> are placed before the seat of the hostess, dinner may be <emph rend="italic">quietly</emph> announced. The host or hostess has, of course, previously indicated to each gentleman the lady with whose escort he is charged, the guest of honor, if a gentleman, escorting the hostess, and taking a seat at her right; if a lady, being escorted by the host to a seat at his right. Each gentleman offers the lady assigned to him his right arm, and escorts her to a seat at his left, passing her in front of him to her chair which he has gracefully drawn back. The distribution of seats will tax the tact of the hostess, as the moment of waiting to be assigned to place is extremely awkward. Of course, all should have been decided on beforehand, and the places should be designated with as little confusion as possible. The success of the dinner will depend largely upon the grouping of agreeable persons. The host leads the way to the dining-room, the hostess follows last, and all guests stand until she is seated. (In France, and at large dinner parties in this country, a card with the name of each guest is placed on the plate which is intended for him.) Once seated the rest is simple routine. Ease of manner of the host and hostess, and quiet and systematic movements in attendants, who should be well trained, alert and noiseless, but never in a hurry, are indispensable. Any betrayal of anxiety or embarrassment on the part of the former, or blundering by the latter, is a wet blanket to all enjoyment.</p><p>The attendant places each dish in succession before the host or hostess (the soup, salad and dessert only being served by the hostess), with the pile of plates. Each plate is supplied, taken by the attendant on a small <implement>salver,</implement> and set before the guest from the left. Any second dish which belongs to the course is presented at the left of the guest, who helps himself. As a rule the lady at the right of the host, or the oldest lady, should be served first. As soon as any one has finished, his plate is promptly removed, and when all are done, the next course is served in the same way. Before the dessert is brought on, all crumbs should be brushed from the cloth. The <implement>finger-bowls,</implement> which are brought in on the napkin on the <implement>dessert-plate</implement> and set off to the left of the plate, are used by dipping the fingers in lightly and drying them on the napkin. They should be half full of warm water with a bit of lemon floating in it. When all have finished dessert, the hostess gives the signal that dinner is ended by pushing back her chair, and the ladies repair to the drawing-room, the oldest leading and the youngest following last, and the gentlemen repairing to the library or smoking-room. In about half an hour, tea is served in the drawing-room with a <implement>cake-basket</implement> of crackers or little cakes, the gentlemen join the ladies, and after a little chat over their cups, all are at liberty to take leave.</p><pb n="352" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=347"/><p>It is, of course presupposed that the host carves, and carves well. If he does not he should forego the pleasure of inviting his friends to dinner, or the dinner should be from chops, ribs, or birds which do not require carving.</p><p>In making up a dinner-party, it is all-important to know who will accept; and invitations, which may be written or printed, and should be sent by messenger and never mailed to persons in the same town, should receive a prompt reply, a day's delay being the extreme limit. The simplest form of invitation and reply is best, but both must be formal, this being one of the occasions on which the wings of genius must be promptly clipped. Ten minutes beyond the appointed time, is the utmost limit of tardiness admissible in a guest, and ten minutes early are quite enough.</p>
<section><hd align="center">THE HOST AND HOSTESS.</hd><p>Those who entertain should remember it is vulgar hospitality, exceedingly annoying to guests, to overload plates, or to insist on a second supply. If the guest wants more, he knows that it is a delicate compliment to a dish to pass his plate the second time. Too great a variety of dishes is also a coarse display. A few cooked to a nicety and served with grace, make the most charming dinners. A sensible bill of fare is soup, fish with one vegetable, a roast with one or two vegetables and a salad and cheese, and a dessert. Parties should be made up of congenial persons, and the table should never be crowded. Novel dishes are great strokes of policy in dinners, but no wise housewife will try experiments on new dishes on such an occasion. The carver should serve meat as he cuts it, so far as possible, and not fill the platter with hacked fragments. It is ill-bred to help too abundantly, or to flood food with gravies, which are disliked by many. Above all, the plate should be served neatly. Nothing creates such disgust as a plate bedaubed with gravy or scattered food. It may be taken for granted that every one will take a piece of breast, and after that is served, it is proper to ask, "what part do you prefer?" The wings and legs should be placed crisp side uppermost, the stuffing should not be scattered, and the brown side or edge of slice should be kept from contact with vegetables or gravy, so that its delicacy may be preserved. Water should be poured at the right hand. Every thing else is served at the left. The hostess should continue eating until all guests have finished. Individual salt-dishes are used at breakfasts, but not at dinners, a cruet with salt dish and spoon, at each end of the table, being preferred as giving the table less of a hotel air. The salt-dishes should be neatly filled. Jellies and sauces are helped on the dinner-plate and not on side dishes. If there are two dishes of dessert, the host may serve the most substantial one. Fruit is served after puddings and pies, and coffee last. In pouring coffee, the sugar and cream is placed in the cup first. If milk is used, it should be scalding hot. Some prefer to make coffee strong; then weaken it with scalding hot milk, and pour into cups in which cream and<pb n="353" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=348"/>sugar have previously been placed. For tea, it is better to pour first and then add cream and sugar. In winter plates should be warmed, not made hot.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">INDIVIDUAL MANNERS.</hd><p>Manners, at table and elsewhere, are made for the convenience and comfort of men, and all social observances have now, or have had at some time, a good reason and sound common sense behind them. It must be remembered, however, that the source of all good manners is a nice perception of and kind consideration for not only the rights but the feelings and even the whims of others. The customs of society are adopted and observed to enable us to be more agreeable, or at least not disagreeable, to friends. And nowhere is the distinction between the gentleman and the boor more marked than at the table. Some persons are morbidly sensitive, and even slight improprieties create disgust, and every true gentleman is bound to respect their sensitiveness and avoid giving pain, whether in sympathy with the feeling or not.</p><p>As this is not an etiquette book, we can only give a few hints. Once seated at table, gloves are drawn off and laid in the lap under the napkin, which is spread lightly, not tucked in. Raw oysters are eaten with a fork; soup from the side of a spoon without noise, or tipping the plate. The mouth should not go to the food, but food to the mouth. Eat without noise and with the lips closed. Friends will not care to see how you masticate your food, unless they are of a very investigating turn of mind. Bread should be broken, not cut, and should be eaten by morsels, and not broken into soup or gravy. It is in bad taste to mix food on the plate. Fish must be eaten with the fork. Maccaroni is cut and cheese crumbled on the plate, and eaten with a fork. Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never cut with a knife. Game and chicken are cut, but never eaten with the bones held in the fingers. Oranges are peeled without breaking the inner skin, being held meantime on a fork. Pears are pared while held by the stem. Cherry-stones, or other substances which are to be removed from the mouth, are passed to the napkin held to the lips, and then returned to the plate. Salt must be left on the side of the plate, and never on the table-cloth. Cut with the knife, but never put it in the mouth; the fork must convey the food, and may be held in either hand as convenient. (Of course, when the old-fashioned two-tined fork is used, it would be absurd to practice this rule.) Food that can not be held with a fork should be eaten with a spoon. Never help yourself to butter or any other food with your own knife or fork. Never pick your teeth at table, or make any sound with the mouth in eating. Bread eaten with meat should not be buttered. Bread and butter is a dish for dessert. Eat slowly for both health and manners. Do not lean your arms on the table, or sit too far back, or lounge. Pay as little attention as possible to accidents. When asked "what do you prefer?" name some part<pb n="354" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=349"/>at once. When done, lay your knife and fork side by side on the plate, with handles to the right. When you rise from your chair leave it where it stands. Of course, loud talking or boisterous conduct is entirely out of place at table, where each should appear at his best, practicing all he can of the amenities of life, and observing all he knows of the forms of good society.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">BREAKFAST PARTIES.</hd><p>Breakfast parties are becoming fashionable in cities, because less formal and expensive than dinners, and quite as agreeable to guests. The courses, which are usually fewer in number, are served precisely as described for dinners. Oat-meal porridge is a favorite and healthful first course, and oranges, melons, and all fruits are delicious breakfast dishes. The variety of omelets is also a great resource, and hundreds of other delicacies and substantials are described elsewhere. But in breakfast--and the same is true of dinners--it is better to have a few, a very few, dishes delicately and carefully cooked, than to attempt more and have them less perfect. In fact the trouble often lies in attempting too many, and the consequent hurry in the kitchen. At breakfast, the coffee is set before the mistress, with cups in their saucers in front of it, in one or two rows. The meat with plates is set before the master. For an ordinary table one castor in the center is sufficient. Fruit is served first; then oatmeal or cracked wheat, next meat and vegetables, followed by hot cakes and coffee. Meats are covered, and cakes are brought in between two plates. Butter is put on in small pats with lumps of ice about it. Honey or maple syrup, for cakes or hot biscuits, is served in saucers. A breakfast-table may be spread attractively with a white cloth, and a scarlet and white napkin under each plate, with white table-mats with a scarlet border.</p><p>For evening parties it is often less expense and trouble to place supper in the hands of a regular confectioner, but for small card or literary parties the trouble need not be great. For regular reception evenings, ices, cakes and chocolate are enough.</p><p>In all cases where no "help" is employed it is better to have some one of the family wait upon the table, the daughters taking turns in serving, as the pleasure of a meal is greatly marred by two or three persons jumping up every now and then, for articles needed.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">TABLE OUTFIT.</hd><p>In the selection of table-wares, there is a wide field for the exercise of taste, and those whose purses permit, need not be at a loss to find the most elegant and artistic designs. An admirable table outfit is an elegant dessert-set, all the pieces of which, except the plates, may decorate the table during the whole dinner, and the rest of white and gilt china. Some have tableware decorated to match the colors of the dining-room, or sets of different patterns for each course, or harlequin sets in which each piece may be of different<pb n="355" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=350"/>pattern or even of different ware. Chinese and Japanese sets are also fashionable. In every case, ware should be the best of its kind, and for economy's sake should be plain, so that broken pieces may be readily and cheaply replaced. Light knives and forks, heavy tea-spoons, and thin glasses for water are most elegant. The chairs should have no arms to interfere with ladies' dresses, and to prevent noise the legs should be tipped with rubber.</p></section>
<section><hd align="center">CLEARING THE TABLE.</hd><p>Gather up the fragments that nothing be lost or wasted. When each meal is over, if you do not have a crumb cloth under the table, which, when the chairs are removed, can be lifted carefully at the edges and the crumbs shaken into the center, it is best to take a broom and sweep the crumbs lightly under the table until the dishes and victuals are removed, then brush on a dust pan. To clear the table, bring in a <implement>dish-pan,</implement> gather up all the silver, cups and saucers, butter and sauce plates, and glassware, carry to the kitchen, place them in the sink and return with the pan. Scrape the plates as clean as possible and put in, add platters and <implement>vegetable dishes,</implement> saving all the remnants of food that are to be kept, on smaller dishes, to be taken to the cellar or refrigerator. To wash the dishes, have clear hot water in the pan, and first wash the silver without soap or cloth, using only the hands; if any are greasy, wipe with a soft paper before putting in the water, rinse in clear hot water and wipe off immediately on a perfectly dry, soft, clean towel; in this way the silver is kept bright, and does not get scratched. Add some soap in the water, make a suds, wash the glassware, rinse and wipe dry. Next take cups and saucers and so on, leaving those most greasy till the last. Always keep a clean dish-cloth. One lady writes, "I have smelt a whole houseful of typhoid fever in one sour, dirty dish-rag." Many prefer the use of three dish-cloths, one for the nicest articles, one for the greasy dishes, and one for the pots and kettles, keeping each cloth perfectly sweet and clean, and, after using it, washing, rinsing, and hanging to dry on a small rack kept for this purpose. The towel for wiping dishes may also dry here. A <implement>dish mop</implement> or swab for washing small deep articles is convenient.</p><p>Let no one suppose that because she lives in a small house, and dines on homely fare, that the general principles here laid down do not apply to her. A small house is more easily kept clean than a palace; taste may be quite as well displayed in the arrangement of dishes on a pine table as in grouping the silver and china of the rich. Skill in cooking is as readily shown in a baked potato or a johnny-cake as in a canvass-back duck. The charm of good housekeeping lies in a nice attention to little things, not in a superabundance. A dirty kitchen and bad cooking have driven many a husband and son, and many a daughter too, from a home that should have been a refuge from temptation. "Bad dinners go hand in hand with total depravity; while a properly fed man is already half saved."</p></section>
</chapter>
<chapter class1="foodandnonfood"><pb n="356" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=351"/><hd align="center" size="larger">THE KITCHEN.</hd><p>It is almost impossible to give any directions except in a general way regarding the kitchen, as there is an endless variety of plans and arrangement. The main point is to systematize every thing, grouping such things as belong to any particular kind of work. For instance, in baking do not go to the china closet for a bowl, across the kitchen for the flour, and to the farther end of the pantry or store-room for an egg, when they may all just as well be within easy reach of each other. Study and contrive to bring order out of the natural chaos of the kitchen, and the head will save the hands and feet much labor.</p><p>If kitchen floors are simply oiled two or three times a year, no grease spot is made when grease drops on them, for it can be easily wiped up--carpet or paint is not advisable. Neither paint nor paper the walls, but once a year apply a coat of the good old-fashioned whitewash. Do not have the wood-work painted; the native wood well oiled and varnished lightly is much the best finish. A wide, roomy dresser is a great convenience; it should have two wide closets below and three narrower ones above, with a row of drawers at top of lower closets. Here should be kept all pots and kettles, sauce-pans, <implement>waffle-irons,</implement> kitchen crockery, tins, etc., all arranged and grouped together so as to be convenient for use. If possible, have good sliding doors, and at top and bottom of same have a narrow sliding panel for a ventilator, which should be closed when sweeping. By this arrangement every article of kitchen ware can be inclosed from the dust and flies. A well-appointed sink is a necessity in every kitchen, and should be near both window and range, so as to have light, and also be convenient to the hot water. It should be provided with a "grooved" and movable <implement>dish drainer,</implement> set so as to drain into the sink. Always have bracket or wall lamps placed at each end, or at the sides, so that the room may be well lighted in the evening. The sink should be washed and <emph rend="italic">wiped dry</emph> daily, or it will become foul, especially if the weather is warm. When possible, a long table at the end of the sink, and so close to it that water can not drip between, on which to dress vegetables, poultry, game, etc., saves time and steps; and the good light, which is a necessity in this part of the room, leaves no excuse for slighted or slovenly work. Under this table may be two drawers, with compartments in one for polishing materials, chamois leather, and articles needed for scouring tin and copper; and in the other, articles for keeping the stove or range in order. Back of the table and sink, the wall should be ceiled with wood for three feet above them, and here may be put up galvanized iron<pb n="357" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=352"/>
hooks and nails on which to hang <implement>basting-spoons,</implement> ladles, cooking forks and spoons, the <implement>chopping-knife,</implement> cake-turner, etc. A set of drawers close at hand for salt, pepper, and spices is also convenient. There should never be bevel, beading, or molding on kitchen window or door frames; and the kitchen door, leading to the dining room, should be faced with rubber and closed with a not too strong spring. Not less than three large windows are desirable in every kitchen, which should be cheerful, pleasant, well ventilated, convenient, and clean.</p><p>In houses of the old style there was either no pantry at all, the kitchen being furnished with a dresser and shelves, or it was merely a small closet to hold the articles in less common use. In modern houses the pantry is next in importance to the kitchen, and it should be so arranged as to accommodate all the appliances used in cookery, as well as the china, glass-ware, cutlery, and other articles for the table, unless a dresser is used as before suggested. In arranging a plan for building, the pantry should receive careful consideration, as next in importance to the kitchen; it should be sufficiently roomy, open into both the dining-room and the kitchen, and, in order to "gave steps," should be as convenient to the range or cooking-stove as circumstances will allow. The window should be placed so as to give light without infringing on the shelving; the shelves should be so arranged as to not obstruct the light from it; the lower ones should be two and a half feet from the floor, and two feet or more in width, and project about three inches beyond the closets and drawers below; and the part near the window, where there is no shelving, may be used for molding and preparing pastry, and such other work as may be most conveniently done here. Other shelves, or a china closet, should be provided for the china and other table furniture in every-day use. The pantry should have an abundance of drawers and closets, of which it is hardly possible to have too many--the upper closets for the nicer china and glass, and the lower ones to hold pans and other cooking utensils in less frequent use. The drawers are for table-linen and the many uses the housekeeper will find for them. If possible, the window should be on the north side, but in any case it should have blinds for shade, and a wire gauze or other screen to keep out flies. Instead of spreading shelves with paper, a neat marbled <implement>oil-cloth</implement> is better, as it is easily cleaned.</p><p>Use a cloth to wash potatoes. It is no trouble to keep one for this purpose, and it will save hands and time. Some prefer a brush. Tie a strip of muslin on the end of a round stick, and use to grease bread and cake-pans, gem-irons, etc. Have two large pockets in your kitchen apron, and in one of them always keep a holder. A piece of clam or oyster shell is much better than a knife to scrape a kettle, should you be so unfortunate as to burn any thing on it. If you use a copper tea-kettle, keep an old dish with sour milk and a cloth in it, wash the kettle with this every morning,<pb n="358" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=353"/>afterward washing off with clear water, and it will always look bright and new. Cut a very ripe tomato and rub over a kitchen table to remove grease. The juice will also remove stains from and whiten the hands. A piece of sponge fastened on the end of a stick or wire is the best thing with which to clean lamp chimneys.</p>
<p>If you use oil, buy the best kerosene. To test it, place a small quantity in a <implement>tea-cup,</implement> and if it does not easily ignite when brought into contact with a lighted taper or match, it is good; poor oil will ignite instantly. Keep oil in a ten-gallon can with a faucet at the lower part, so as to draw off into a smaller can or <implement>lamp-filler;</implement> set the large can in a cool dark place; keep all the articles used for cleaning, filling, and trimming lamps by themselves. For these purposes provide an old <implement>waiter</implement> (to hold the things), a <implement>lamp-filler,</implement> pair of scissors or a <implement>lamp-trimmer,</implement> box of wicks, soap, washing soda, and several soft cloths and towels, also a wire hairpin with which to keep open the vent in the burner. When lamps need an extra cleaning, add one table-spoon soda to a quart of water, being careful that none of the bronze or gilding comes in contact with the soda. When the wick becomes too short to carry up the kerosene, and if you have not time to put in a new wick, a piece of cotton rag pinned on below will prove a good feeder. If a hole is broken in a glass chimney, paste on a piece of paper and it will answer its purpose until you get a new chimney. When the burners of lamps become gummy and prevent the wicks moving freely, boil them up in suds over the fire a short time, and they will become entirely clean and work well. Lamps may become incrusted inside with settlings from the oil, and ordinary washing will not remove it. Take soap-suds and fill the lamp about one-third full, then put in a little sharp sand, and shake vigorously. A few minutes will remove every particle of settlings. Always fill the lamps every day and in the day-time; never fill a lamp after dark near a lighted lamp; never light an almost empty lamp, as the empty space is nearly always filled with a very explosive gas. In putting out a lamp, turn the flame down low, and wave a fan, book, or paper across the top of the chimney. Blowing down a chimney is very dangerous when a lamp is nearly empty and turned up high. Never start a fire with the oil.</p><p>Fill new tin pans with boiling water (having a little soda in it), let stand on a warm part of the range for a while, wash in strong soap-suds, rinse, and dry well. Scouring tins very often with whiting or ashes wears them out; if properly taken care of, washed in suds and thoroughly dried, they will not need scouring.</p><p>Boil ashes or a bunch of hay or grass in a new iron pot before cooking in it; scour well with soap and sand, then fill with clean water, and boil one or two hours. Knives for the table should never be used to cook with; those for the former purpose may be a cheap plated set for every-day use, and should be kept by themselves, and never allowed to be used in the kitchen.<pb n="359" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=354"/>Never place a range or cooking stove opposite a door or window if it can be avoided, as any draft will prevent the oven from baking well.</p><p>A necessity in the kitchen, because a great protection against clothes taking fire, is a large kitchen apron made full length with bib, and sleeves if wished, the skirt to button close around the dress-skirt. A wooden mat (made by laying down six pieces of lath eleven inches long, one inch wide, and an inch apart, and nailing across these, at right angles, six other similar pieces, about the same distance apart) is a great protection to the kitchen table, which should be of ash. Hot kettles and pans from the stove may be set on this without danger, as the construction of the mat secures a circulation of air under it.</p>
<p>There is an old and true saying that "a woman can throw out with a spoon faster than a man can throw in with a shovel." In cooking meats, for instance, unless watched, the cook will throw out the water without letting it cool to take off the fat, or scrape the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> into the swill-pail. This grease is useful in many ways. Bits of meat are thrown out which would make good hashed meat or hash; the flour is sifted in a wasteful manner, or the bread-pan left with dough sticking to it; pie-crust is left and laid by to sour, instead of making a few tarts for tea; cake batter is thrown out because but little is left; cold puddings are considered good for nothing, when often they can be steamed for the next day, or, as in case of rice, made over in other forms; vegetables are thrown away that would warm for breakfast nicely; dish-towels are thrown down where mice can destroy them; soap is left in water to dissolve, or more used than is necessary; the scrub-brush is left in the water, pails scorched by the stove, tubs and barrels left in the sun to dry and fall apart, chamber-pails allowed to rust, tins not dried, and iron-ware rusted; nice knives are used for cooking in the kitchen, silver spoons used to scrape kettles, or forks to toast bread; cream is allowed to mold and spoil, mustard to dry in the pot, and vinegar to corrode the <implement>casters;</implement> tea, roasted coffee, pepper, and spices to stand open and lose their strength; the molasses jug loses the cork and the flies take possession; vinegar is drawn in a basin and allowed to stand until both basin and vinegar are spoiled; sugar is spilled from the barrel, coffee from the sack, and tea from the chest; different sauces are made too sweet, and both sauce and sugar are wasted; dried fruit has not been taken care of in season, and becomes wormy; the vinegar on pickles loses strength or leaks out, and the pickles become soft; potatoes in the cellar grow, and the sprouts are not removed until they become worthless; apples decay for want of looking over; pork spoils for want of salt, and beef because the brine wants scalding; hams become tainted or filled with vermin, for want of the right protection; dried beef becomes so hard it can't be cut; cheese molds and is eaten by mice or vermin; bones are burnt that will make soup; ashes are thrown out carelessly, endangering the premises, and wasting<pb n="360" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=355"/>them; servants leave a light and fire burning in the kitchen, when they are out all the evening; clothes are whipped to pieces in the wind, fine cambrics rubbed on the board, and laces torn in starching; brooms are never hung up, and are soon spoiled; carpets are swept with stubs hardly fit to scrub the kitchen, and good new brooms used for scrubbing; towels are used in place of holders, and good sheets to iron on, taking a fresh one every week; table linen is thrown carelessly down, and is eaten by mice, or put away damp and is mildewed; or the fruit stains are forgotten, and the stains washed in; table-cloths and napkins used as dish-wipers; mats forgotten to be put under hot dishes; tea-pots melted by the stove; water forgotten in pitchers, and allowed to freeze in winter; slops for cows and pigs never saved; china used to feed cats and dogs on; and in many other ways a careless or inexperienced housekeeper wastes, without heeding, the hardearned wages of her husband. Economy counts nowhere so well as in the kitchen.</p><p>TEA.--Keep tea in a close chest or canister.</p><p>BREAD.--Keep bread or cake in a tin box or stone jar.</p><p>NUTMEG.--Always grate nutmegs at the blossom end first.</p><p>COFFEE.--Keep coffee by itself, as its odor affects other articles.</p><p>RED ANTS.--Scatter branches of sweet-fern where they congregate.</p><p>STAIN ON SPOONS.--from boiled egg is removed by rubbing with a little salt.</p><p>CRANBERRIES.--Cranberries will keep all winter in a firkin of water in a cellar.</p><p>TO PRESERVE MILK.--A spoonful of grated horse-radish will keep a pan of milk sweet for days.</p><p>ORANGES.--Oranges and lemons keep best wrapped in soft paper, and, if possible, laid in a drawer.</p><p>CORKS.--When corks are too large to go into a bottle, throw them into hot water a few moments, and they will soften.</p><p>CHARRED CASKS.--Water and salt meat may be preserved pure a long time if put up in <implement>casks</implement> with the inside charred.</p><p>POLISHING.--Flour of emery, which is cheap and is kept at all drug-stores, is excellent for polishing every thing except silver. Keep it in an old <implement>pepper box.</implement></p>

<p>TO KEEP CUTLERY FROM RUST.--Wipe dry, and wrap in coarse brown paper.</p><p>DRAINS.--Chloride of lime dissolved in water should occasionally be poured down the drains.</p><p>TO REMOVE A TIGHT GLASS STOPPER.--Apply a cloth wet in hot water to the neck of the bottle; or wind a cord around once, and "saw" back and forth a few times. This will heat and expand the neck of the bottle.</p><p>RUST ON STEEL IMPLEMENTS OR KNIVES.--Cover the steel with sweet oil, rubbing it on well. Let it remain for forty-eight hours, and then, using finely powdered unslaked lime, rub the steel until all the rust has disappeared.</p><p>TO PRESERVE LAMP CHIMNEYS FROM BREAKING.--Place a cloth in the bottom of a large pan, fill the pan with cold water, and place new chimney in it; cover the pan, and let its contents boil one hour; take from fire, and let chimney remain in the water until it is cold.</p>

<p>WATER--boiled in galvanized iron becomes poisonous, and cold water passed through zinc-lined iron pipes, should never be used for cooking or drinking.

Pink mosquito netting is handsomer, but does not keep off dust when the table is set for next meal immediately after the dishes are washed--the most convenient plan where the dining room is not need for other purposes.</p><p>CABBAGE WATER.--Be careful that no cabbage water is poured down the kitchen sink, as the smell of it--a singularly unpleasant one--is so strong that it will penetrate all over the house, and produce the suspicion of a bad drain. The water in which any kind of cabbage has been boiled, should be thrown away out of doors, in a distant corner of the garden, if possible.</p>

<p>TO CLEAN COFFEE OR TEA-POTS.--Musty <implement>coffee-pots</implement> and tea-pots may be cleaned and sweetened by putting a good quantity of wood ashes into them and filling up with cold water. Set on the stove to heat gradually till the water boils. Let it boil a short time, then set aside to cool, when the inside should be faithfully washed and scrubbed in hot soap-suds, using a small brush that every spot may be reached; then scald two or three times, and wipe till well dried. Pots and pans or plates that have been used for baking and grown rancid, may be cleansed in the same way. Put the plates into a pan with wood ashes and cold water, and proceed as above stated. If no wood ashes can be had, take soda. <implement>Pie-plates</implement> and <implement>baking dishes</implement> cleaned after this fashion will keep sweet all the time.</p><p>TO WASH PRESERVE JARS.--<implement>Preserve jars</implement> or bottles should be carefully washed as soon as emptied, taking care that the stoppers and covers have their share of attention. It is well to put soda or ammonia into the jars or<pb n="362" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=357"/>
bottles, fill up with water, and let stand an hour, putting the stoppers or covers into a bowl to soak in the same way. Then pour out and scald nicely, but not with boiling water as that cracks the polished surface inside, wipe dry, set in the sun or wind to air, and then set away carefully.</p><p>TO CLEAN KNIVES.--Cut a good-sized, solid, raw potato in two; dip the flat surface in powdered brick-dust, and rub the knife-blades. Stains and rust will disappear. Or rub up and down in the ground.</p><p>PULVERIZED CHARCOAL--should be kept in every house in a glass jar, with a wide mouth, containing a half pint. The coal should be freshly burned--the best is not from the hardest or the softest wood, but a medium--pulverized finely in a <implement>mortar</implement> while the coals are yet red. Cork tight; it is invaluable in preserving meats and poultry, and is sometimes even given as a remedy for indigestion.</p><p>TO KEEP TABLE CLOTHS CLEAN--for a long time. After cleaning the table, place a clean towel under any spots that may have been made during dinner, and rub the spot with a fresh clean cloth wet with clean soap-suds, then rinse with clean water, dry with a clean dry towel, fold and lay under a heavy weight. In changing table cloths during the week, contrive to each end of table cloth on first at dinner. Place a large napkin over each end of table cloth, to protect it from soiling in the process of serving the plates, removing when the crumbs are brushed.</p><p>WASHING DISHES.--In washing dishes, in addition to directions given in "Dining Room," care must be taken not to put <implement>tumblers</implement> which have had milk in them into hot water, as it drives the milk into the glass, whence it can never be removed. They should be first rinsed well in tepid water. <implement>Tumblers</implement> and <implement>goblets</implement> should be placed in hot soapy water, dipping the sides first, and turning them rapidly, thus heating the outside and inside at the same time and preventing breaking; when wiped, they should not be turned down until put away in a china closet. Yeast jars should always be washed in cold water, and afterwards thoroughly scalded.</p><p>DISH CLOTHS, WIPERS, TABLE LINENS, ETC.--Roller towels for the hands should be marked with the number of each, and also with the whole number; as 1-6, 2-6, etc., where the whole number is six. This shows at once the whole number to be accounted for, and also makes it easy to use them in rotation, so that they may be worn equally. Of dish cloths, of which there should be six--two for the best dishes, two for greasy, and to for pots and kettles, the first two may be marked, "B-1-2" and "B-2-2;" the second two, "G-1-2" and "G-2-2;" the third, "P-1-2" and "P-2-2."

A few years ago the process was invented and first used in the young city of Minneapolis, which now exports nearly a million and a quarter barrels of flour yearly, and finds a market for it in every quarter of the United States and Europe. The wheat from which this flour is made, is the hard spring wheat, <emph rend="italic">raised in the extreme North</emph>, that raised south of Minnesota and Dakota being inferior, and most of it not available for the best grades, while that raised on the line of the North Pacific, and in the rich valley of the Red River of the North, makes the very highest grades of flour. This hard wheat is first passed through rollers and mashed; then, to the stones, which are run at a low rate of speed, and so dressed that the grinding is nearly all done near the outer edge of the stone, the "runner" being set high, so as not to heat the flour, but to leave it in hard, sharp globules. From this stone it is conveyed to a series of bolts, where the bran is separated, the softer and finer particles being passed through and put up as lower grades of flour, known as "All-Wheat Flour." The coarser particles and "middlings" are separated by this process, and conveyed to the "purifiers," where they are thoroughly cleaned of all bran and impurities; after which, they go to the stones to be reground and rebolted, and thus made into the "Patent Process Flour." These middlings are mainly from the outer portion of the kernel, which lies immediately below the flinty and worthless husk (which goes off in bran), and is rich in the nutritious gluten--the nitrogenous principle of wheat which makes it rank first as a "force-producing" food. Before the introduction of this process, the stones were driven at a high rate of speed, and the wheat thoroughly ground by the first run through the <implement>mill,</implement> the flour coming out quite hot, and much of its strength lost by the heating. The comparative rate of speed may be known by the fact that only five bushels are ground per hour by the new process; while, with the old, from fifteen to eighteen would have been consumed. By the old process, the "middlings" made a second-rate dark flour; by the new, it is transformed into the best known to the trade.</p><p>That this flour is the most economical for use, there is no doubt among those who have tried it. The hard spring wheat makes a much stronger flour than any of the soft varieties of spring or winter wheat, because it<pb n="364" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=359"/>contains a larger proportion of gluten and less starch; and a given quantity will make from fifteen to twenty per cent. more loaves of bread of the same size and weight than the best winter wheat flour. This fact is what has given Minnesota baker's grades their popularity. Another advantage possessed by this flour, especially for family use, is that bread from it does not become stale and dry as soon as that made from winter wheat, but retains its moisture and good table qualities much longer.</p><p>The following in regard to the New Process Flour is from George H. Christian, Esq., who has spent years in studying the best methods in use in this country and Europe, and is the largest manufacturer in the United States:</p><p>"In regard to the economy of the New Process Flour, made from Minnesota spring wheat, it is claimed, and I believe, has been established, that the best qualities will make forty or fifty pounds of bread to the barrel more than flour from the best quality of winter wheat. This is explained by its superior affinity for water, which, being held in that much greater quantity in the bread, insures its keeping moist for a long time. Perhaps it might interest the scrupulous housewife to know that the New Process Flour is cleaner, all of the shell or bran being taken away before this kind of flour is made by the <implement>mill-stones.</implement> The authorities give the chemical analysis as 20 parts gluten, 50 parts starch, 10 parts dextrine, glucose, etc., 5 parts salts, fatty material, etc., and 15 parts water, for flour made from the best Minnesota spring wheat by the new process. The above percentage of gluten is nearly double that of flour made from the soft varieties of wheat (that of Minnesota is of the hard). Gluten is the most important compound of flour, and is the substance which renders the dough firm, and gives it sufficient consistency to hold the gases, generated by fermentation, long enough to make it rise well, and ensure a light palatable bread. It is well known also that bread from spring wheat is sweeter. The percentage of gluten in New Process Flour is more than in flour made of the same wheat by the old process."</p>

Tin-lined vessels, when only partly filled, often become so much heated that the tin is oxydized, and mingles with the food, and is an irritant poison.</p><p>SPICE CABINET.--A little bureau, about a foot high, with each drawer labeled outside, "nutmegs," "cloves," etc., and put up near where cakes, etc., are made. It costs little, probably about two dollars, and is a great convenience.</p><p>THE <implement>BAIN MARIE</implement>--is an open vessel filled with hot, not boiling water, and set on back of stove or range. In this, tin <implement>stew-pans</implement> or cups with handles and tight covers, containing vegetables, sauces, and other articles that need to be kept warm.</p><p><implement>FLOWER FORMS.</implement>--Forms in the shape of a circle, cross, anchor, or other fanciful device, may be made of tin, about one inch deep, in which to arrange flat bouquets in wet sand or water, for the table. Very small ones in initials may be made to designate the plate to which guests are assigned.</p><p><implement>FISH-KETTLE.</implement>--An oblong kettle for boiling fish, which has a false bottom of perforated tin, with handles at either end. The fish is placed on this perforated tin, lowered into the kettle, boiled, and, when done, lifted out again, and gently slipped from the tin to the platter on which it is to be served.</p><p>TEA-KETTLE <implement>BOILER.</implement>--A long tapering tin dish, with a long handle, made to lower into the tea-kettle, and large enough at the top to fill the opening, and long enough to reach to the bottom. The cover of the tea-kettle may be used to put over it. It is used for cooking gruels, custards, etc., and serves as a <implement>steamer</implement> for puddings, brown bread, etc., for a small family.</p><p><implement>JELLY-STAND.</implement>--Four upright posts about a foot high, set about a foot apart, and joined at top and bottom with rounds, as the legs of the chair are joined. This makes a frame, with which the <implement>jelly bag</implement> (the top of which should be whipped over a strong wire) may be suspended by cords running from the wire in the top of the bag to each corner post. Pour in the jelly or soup, place a dish underneath, and allow to drain.</p><p>THE FERRIS COOKER--Is a round pile of pans, placed over an iron dish of boiling water, each dish or pan ready for any food--meat, poultry, vegetables, pies, puddings, or bread--all cooking at once, and all covered closely so as to retain the steam, by a round top that shuts down over every dish and fits tightly into the reservoir of water beneath. It makes a tall pile on the stove, but takes up no more room than one kettle, and its height does not interfere with any other kettle or sauce-pan that may be on the range.</p><p>A TOASTER--is made of a sheet of tin large enough to contain six slices of bread. The edges are turned up about half an inch and bound with wire, and perforations are cut about two inches apart in the shape of a V through the bottom, and the sharp points turnedup so as to penetrate and hold the bread in place. A stiff wire handle is fastened firmly to the middle of the back, so that the toaster is kept at the right angle before the fire, and, if it toasts too rapidly at top or bottom, it may easily be inverted.</p><pb n="366" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=361"/>
<p>POLISHER AND STAND.--A small neat stand, made of coppered iron, with a surface of emery (three extra emery pads go with each) for cleaning starch, etc., from <implement>flat-irons.</implement></p><p>A <implement>KNIFE BOARD.</implement>--A board two feet long by one wide, with a half-inch strip fastened to the edge, and raised a little above it all round, to keep the sand from falling off. At one end fasten in some way a scouring brick (such as all grocers keep), and on the other tack a piece of buff leather, three by seven inches. A few strokes over the leather after scouring gives a high polish.</p><p>STEAMING KETTLE.--A shallow pan with a perforated bottom, lowered its full length into a deep kettle. To steam vegetables, puddings, or in fact any thing that is usually cooked by immersion in hot water, put water in the deep kettle, place article in the perforated pan, cover closely, and keep the water boiling. It is impossible for any article so cooked to become water-soaked.</p><p>THE KITCHEN GEM.--A kettle-shaped vessel made of tinned wire, to be filled with articles to be boiled, and lowered into another kettle which contains the water. It is provided with a bail by which to lift it out, and with projecting flauges which rest on the top of the outer kettle, touching neither the bottom or sides, so as to keep it suspended either in or over the water; when done, the cooked articles are lifted out in it. It is admirable for vegetables, for making soups (especially when the meat is to be served on the table), and for boiling eggs, as well as for steaming dumplings, puddings, etc.</p><p>CAKE-PAN.--The bottom and sides are not permanently attached, but when fastened together, are in the shape of an ordinary cake-pan. When the cake is done, by unfastening the hooks that join the two ends of the strips of tin that forms the sides of the pan, it opens and leaves the cake standing on the bottom of the pan, from which it is slipped on a plate without inverting, as is necessary with the old-style pan. The bottom is also provided with a movable stem, which may be taken off when using the dish for puddings, bread, etc.</p><p><implement>BOSOM BOARD.</implement>--A board twenty inches long, and ten to twelve inches wide. The shirt is slipped over it and buttoned at the neck; at the other end of the board is a strip about an inch wide, fastened to the board by an arm at each end, running along the sides of the board. This strip is pushed down, one "flap" of the shirt drawn through between it and the end of the board, and then it is raised up so that its surface is again on a level with the board. It thus holds the shirt firmly in position while it is being ironed and polished.</p><p>OTHER CONVENIENCES.--Among these are a <implement>soup-kettle</implement> (with a double bottom); a polishing iron for shirts (or a substitute may be made by selecting your best iron, and rounding and polishing both ends); a <implement>jagging-iron,</implement> to mark and ornament paste for pies; a pair of good scales; a movable sink, set on very large strong casters, which may be run into the dining-room to receive the dishes from the table and pushed out to the kitchen; for summer use, a gas-stove, or when gas is not used, a Houchin pocket cooking stove, on which modest meals for a small family may be cooked without building a fire in the kitchen stove. The latter is also useful for travelers, at camp meetings, and in the sick-room for making toast, and keeping articles warm; a <implement>soap-shaker,</implement> a perforated oval tin box with a long handle, which, after a cake of soap has been placed in it, is shaken in the dish-water to make a suds; and a cast-iron soap dish, which fastens on the side of the wash-tub, while washing with hard soap.</p></section>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><pb n="367" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=362"/><hd align="center" size="larger">THE MANAGEMENT OF HELP.</hd><p>In all families whose style of living demands help in the household duties, the management of "girls" is the great American puzzle. "Girls" come and go like the seasons, sometimes with the weeks. The one who is "such a treasure" to-day, packs her trunk and leaves her mistress in the lurch to-morrow, or, if she happens to have a conscience and works on faithfully, she becomes the mistress and runs the household in her own way, her employer living in mortal fear of offending and losing her. This state of things is due partly to the fact that all girls who go out to service, do so as a make-shift until they marry or obtain some more congenial work. Few of them have any ambition to do their work well, and few ever dream of making themselves a necessity in the family, becoming a part of it, sharing its joys and sorrows, and so establishing that honorable and close relation which exists between servants and families in Europe. Here, it is so much work for so much pay, and no bond of sympathy or attachment is allowed to spring up on either side. Another cause is the fact that too many American women who ought to know better, regard work as degrading, instead of positively elevating and ennobling when it is well and conscientiously done. Is it wonderful that "girls" catch something of this vicious sentiment, and that it poisons their minds with false views of life, until they look upon their work as brutal drudgery, and strive to do as little of it as they possibly can and collect their wages.</p><p>Perhaps the reason why girls prefer situations in stores, or shops, or even factories, to housework, is that their work there is confined to certain hours after which they are free, and it is quite possible that an arrangement which would give the domestic certain hours of the day for her own, would work a reform; or still better, certain reasonable tasks might be allotted her to do, after which she would be free.</p><p>The fixed wages which prevail in most cities and towns offer no inducement for the "girl" to try to become skillful or expert at her work. Among men the best, neatest, and most skillful workman commands the largest pay, but the "girl" who is a superior cook, or maid of all work, gets only the same wages paid to a bungler who lives next door. Such a thing as a combination among ladies who employ help, to grade wages and protect each other from the imposition of untidy, dishonest, or indolent "girls," has never been made, and perhaps, indeed, it is no more called for than a combination of "girls" to protect themselves from lazy, tyrannical, or too exacting mistresses. Certain it is that the whole system by which domestics are hired and serve is demoralized beyond any speedy reform. All that any individual can do is to remedy its evils so far as is possible in her own family. In<pb n="368" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=363"/>employing a new domestic, there should be the utmost frankness. She ought to be fully informed as to what she is expected to do, what her wages will be and how paid, and what privileges will be granted. If she is not pleased, let her depart without regret. If you engage her, let her understand first and always that you are mistress, and claim the right to have the work done in your way, which, if you are as skillful a housewife as you ought to be, you will be able to show her is the best way. The mistress ought always to be able to do every thing better and quicker than any domestic ever dared think of doing it. If she gives orders which betray her ignorance, she may as well resign her sceptre at once in shame and humiliation. No mistress who does not know how to do work herself can ever be just to her help, and even when she is a thorough housekeeper, a turn in the kitchen for a day or two will often be like a new revelation to her.</p><p>Above all, the utmost kindness should be shown, and the mistress of the house should always be mistress of her temper. She should put herself in the "girl's" place, and apply the golden rule in all dealings with her. Give unqualified praise when deserved, but never scold. If any thing is done improperly, take some proper time and have it done correctly, again and again if necessary. Give domestics all the privileges possible, and when obliged to deprive them of any customary indulgence, make it up soon in some other way. Never to find fault at the time an error is committed, if in the least irritated or annoyed, is an invaluable rule in the management of domestics or children, and indeed in all the relations of life. A quiet talk after all feeling has subsided, will do wonders towards reform, while a sharp and bitter rebuke would only provoke to further disobedience. It is especially important and right to respect religious and conscientious scruples, no matter how light and misguided they may seem. To cherish what beliefs she pleases is an inalienable right. The care for the comfort and attractiveness of the domestic's room is also a duty which every generous mistress will cheerfully look after. The servant who is tucked away in a gloomy attic, unfinished, uncarpeted, and uncurtained except by cobwebs, with the hardest bed and the meanest bed-clothing in the house, can hardly be expected to be neat and tidy in her personal habits. But after all, it will be impossible to secure and keep really good "girls," unless they can be won into sympathy and attachment to the family, so that they will regard themselves as a part of it, with a future identified with its fortunes. To do this, the mistress must respect her maid as a sensitive woman like herself, and not class her as a mere drudge of an inferior order of creation. She must recognize the fact that character, and not station or wealth, make the lady, and that it is possible for those who serve to respect themselves. She must let her domestics see that she does not consider their work degrading, but honorable, and that she does not for a moment expect them to regard it in any other light. Above all, she must never show them, by word, look, or action, that she "looks down" on them because of their work. By the cultivation of such amenities as these, the house may really be made a <emph rend="italic">home</emph> for the domestic as<pb n="369" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=364"/>well as the family, and the mistress who has accomplished this may well congratulate herself on having escaped the worst and most perplexing ills of the life of the American housewife. In her efforts to bring about such a result, she may confidently count on meeting many cases of incompetence, stupidity, and even ingratitude, but the experiment itself is in the right direction, and if it fails of complete success can not be wholly without good results.</p>

Whoever looks down on you because you do honest work conscientiously and well, is a fool, and not worth minding.</p></section></chapter>
<chapter class1="generalfood"><pb n="370" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=365"/><hd align="center" size="larger">HINTS ABOUT MARKETING.</hd><p>Very few housekeepers understand how to select meats wisely or how to buy economically. Most trust the butcher, or buy at hap-hazard, with no clear understanding of what they want, and no consideration at all for economy; and yet a little knowledge of facts, with a moderate amount of experience and observation, will enable any one to buy both intelligently and economically. It is best, when possible, to buy for cash. Ready money always commands the best in the market, at the lowest prices. It is also better to buy of the most respectable regular dealer in the neighborhood, than of transient and irresponsible parties. Apparent "bargains" frequently turn out the worst possible investments. If a dealer imposes on you, drop him at once. In buying beef, select that which is of a clear, cherry-red color after a fresh cut has been for a few moments exposed to the air. The fat should be of a light straw color, and the meat marbled throughout with fat. If the beef is immature, the color of the lean part will be pale and dull, the bones small, and the fat very white. High-colored, coarse-grained beef, with the fat a deep yellow, should be rejected. In corn-fed beef the fat is yellowish, while that fattened on grasses is whiter. In cow-beef the fat is also whiter than in ox-beef. Inferior meat from old or ill fed animals has a coarse, skinny fat and a dark red lean. Ox-beef is the sweetest and most juicy, and the most economical. When meat pressed by the finger rises up quickly, it is prime, but if the dent disappears slowly, or remains, it is inferior in quality. Any greenish tints about either fat or lean, or slipperiness of surface, indicate that the meat has been kept so long that putrefaction has begun, and, consequently, is unfit for use, except by those persons who prefer what is known as a "high flavor." Tastes differ as to the choice cuts. The tenderloin, which is the choicest piece, and is sometimes removed by itself, lies under the short ribs and close to the backbone, and is usually cut through with the porterhouse and sirloin steaks. Of these the porterhouse is generally preferred, the part nearest the thin bone being the sweetest. If the generally preferred, the part nearest the thin bone being the sweetest. If the tenderloin is wanted, it may be secured by buying an edgebone steak, the remainder of which, after the removal of the tenderloin, is equal to the sirloin. The small porterhouse steaks are the most economical, but in large steaks, the coarse and tough parts may be used for soup, or, after boiling, for hash, which, in spite of its bad repute, is really a very nice dish when well made. A round steak, when the leg is not cut down too far, is sweet and juicy, the objection being its toughness, to cancel which it may be chopped fine, seasoned, and made into breakfast croquettes. The interior portion of the round is the tenderest and best. The roasting pieces are the sirloin and the ribs,<pb n="371" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=366"/>the latter being most economical at the family table, the bones forming an excellent basis for soup, and the meat, when boned and rolled up (which should be done by the butcher), and roasted, being in good form for the carver, as it enables him to distribute equally the upper part with the fatter and more skinny portions. A roast served in this way, if cooked rare, may be cooked a second or even a third time. There are roasts and other meats equally good in the fore quarter of beef, but the proportion of bone to meat is greater.</p><p>Veal should be clear and firm, and the fat white. If dark and thin, with tissues hanging loosely about the bone, it is not good. Veal will not keep so long as an older meat, especially in hot or damp weather, and when going, the fat is soft and moist, the meat flabby and spotted, and inclined to be porous like a sponge. Overgrown veal is inferior to that which is smaller but well fatted.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>Mutton should be fat, and the fat clear and white. Be wary of buying mutton with yellow fat. An abundance of fat is a source of waste, but as the lean part of fat mutton is much more juicy and tender than any other, it should be chosen. After the butcher has cut off all he can be persuaded to remove, you will still have to trim it freely before broiling. The lean of mutton> is quite different from that of beef. While beef is a bright carnation, mutton is a deep, dark red. The hind quarter of mutton is best for roasting. The ribs may be used for chops and are the sweeter, but the leg cutlets are the most economical, as there is much less bone, and no hard meat as on the ribs. <variation>Almost any part will do for 
<purpose>broth.</purpose>
As much of the fat should be removed as practicable, then cut into small pieces and simmered slowly until the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> falls to pieces. Drain off and skim off any remaining fat, and thicken with <ingredient>rice or vermicelli.</ingredient></variation></p></recipe>
<p>Lamb is good at a year old, and more digestible than most immature meats. The meat should be light red and fat. If not too warm weather, it ought to be kept a few days before cooking. It is stringy and indigestible if cooked too soon after killing.</p><p>Great care must be taken in selecting pork. If ill-fed or diseased, no meat is more injurious to the health. The lean must be fine-grained, and both fat and lean very white. The rind should be smooth and cool to the touch. If clammy, be sure the pork is stale, and reject it. If the fat is full of small kernels, it is an indication of disease. In good bacon the rind is thin, the fat firm and the lean tender. Rusty bacon has yellow streaks in it. Hams are tried by sticking a knife into them. If when drawn out it has no bad odor, the ham is good.</p><p>Meat should always be wiped with a dry, clean towel as soon as it comes from the butcher's, and in loins the pipe which runs along the bone should be removed, as it soon taints. Never buy bruised meat.</p><p>When found necessary to keep meat longer than was expected, sprinkle<pb n="372" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=367"/>pepper, either black or red, over it. It can be washed off easily when ready for cooking. Powdered charcoal is excellent to prevent meat from tainting. Meat which has been kept on ice must be cooked immediately, but it is much better to place meats, poultry, game, etc., by the side of, not on, ice, as it is the cold air, not the ice, which arrests decay. All meats except veal, are better when kept a few days in a cool place.</p>
<section><hd align="center">GAME AND POULTRY.</hd><p>The choice of venison should be regulated by the fat, which, when the venison is young, should be thick, clear, and close, while the meat is a reddish brown. As it always begins to taint first near the haunches, run a knife into that part; if tainted, a rank smell and a greenish appearance will be perceptible. It may be kept a long time, however; with careful management and watching, by the following process: Wash it well in milk and water, and dry it perfectly with a cloth until there is not the least damp remaining; then dust ground pepper over every part. This is a good preservative against the fly. The flesh of a female deer, about four years old, is the sweetest and best of venison.</p>

<section><hd align="center">FISH.</hd><p>When fresh, the eyes of fish are full and bright, and the gills a fine clear red, the body stiff and the smell not unpleasant. Mackerel must be lately caught or it is very indifferent fish, and the flavor and excellence of salmon depends entirely on its freshness. Lobsters when freshly caught have some muscular action in their claws which may be excited by pressing the eyes. The heaviest lobsters are the best. The male is thought to have the highest flavor, the flesh is firmer, and the shell has a brighter red; it may be readily distinguished from the female, as the tail is narrower, and the two uppermost fins, within the tail, are stiff and hard; those of the female are soft, and the tail broader. Hen lobsters are prepared for sauces on account of their coral. The head and smallest claws are never used. If crabs are fresh, the eyes are bright, the joints of the legs are stiff and the inside has an agreeable smell. The heaviest are the best, the light ones being watery. Scallops are not much used; when fresh the shell closes tight; hard-shell clams are also closed tight when fresh. Soft-shell clams are good only in cold weather, and should be fresh. Oysters, if alive and healthy, close tight upon the knife. They are good from September to May.</p><p>In fresh-water fish the same signs of freshness are good tests. Of course it is impossible to name all the excellent varieties, as they differ with the locality. In the South is the shad, the sheep's-head, the golden mullet and the Spanish mackerel; in the North-west the luscious brook trout, and the wonderful and choice tribes that people the inland lakes. Among the best of the fresh-water fish sold generally in the markets of the interior, are the<pb n="374" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=369"/>Lake Superior trout and white fish, and coming from cold waters they keep best of all fresh-water fish; the latter is the best, most delicate, and has fewer bones, greatly resembling shad. The wall-eyed pike, bass and pickerel of the inland lakes are also excellent fish, and are shipped, packed in ice, reaching market as fresh as when caught, and are sold at moderate prices. California salmon is also shipped in the same way, and is sold fresh in all cities, with fresh cod and other choice varieties from the Atlantic coast, but the long distance which they must be transpoted makes the pice high. The cat-fish is the staple Mississippi river fish, and is cooked in various ways. Lake Superior trout are the best fresh fish for baking. All fish which have been packed in ice should be cooked immediately after removal, as they soon grow soft and lose their flavor. Stale fish must never be eaten. Fresh fish should be scaled and cleaned properly on a dry table and not in a pan of water. As little water should be used as is compatible with perfect cleanliness. When dressed, place near ice until needed, then remove and cook immediately. If frozen when brought from market, thaw in ice-cold water. Fresh cod, whiting, haddock, and shad are better for being salted the night before cooking them, and the muddy smell and taste of fresh-water fish is removed by soaking, after cleaning, in strong salt and water.</p><p>Eels must be dressed as soon as possible, or they lose their sweetness; cut off the head, skin them, cut them open, and scrape them free from every string. They are good except in the hottest summer months, the fat ones being best. A fine codfish is thick at the back of the neck, and is best in cold weather. In sturgeon the flesh should be white, the veins blue, the grain even and the skin tender.</p><p>The best salt mackerel for general use are "English mess," but "bloaters" are considered nicer. In selecting always choose those which are thick on the belly and fat; poor mackerel are always dry. The salt California salmon are excellent, those of a dark rich yellow being best. To freshen, place <emph rend="italic">with scale side up</emph>. Salmon boiled and served with egg sauce or butter dressing is nice. No. 1 white fish is also a favorite salt fish, and will be found in all markets.</p><p>A good deal of sturgeon is put up and sold for smoked halibut. The skin of halibut should be white; if dark it is more likely to be sturgeon. Smoked salmon should be firm and dry. Smoked white fish and trout are very nice, the former being a favorite in whatever way dressed. Select good firm whole fish. White fish is very nice broiled. Each of the above is better than herring.</p></section>

<chapter class1="generalfood"><pb n="375" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=370"/><hd align="center" size="larger">CARVING.</hd><p>It is no trifling accomplishment to carve well, and both ladies and gentlemen ought to so far make carving a study that they may be able to perform the task with sufficient skill at least to prevent remark. There are no real difficulties in the way of mastering the accomplishment; knowledge simply is required. All displays of exertion are in bad taste, because they indicate a want of ability on the part of the carver, or are a strong indication of the toughness of the roast or the age of the bird. A good knife of moderate size and great sharpness is a necessity. Fowls are easily carved, and in roasts such as loins, breasts, forequarters, etc., the butcher should always have instructions to separate the joints. The platter should be placed so near to the carver that he has full control over it; if far off, nothing can prevent an ungraceful appearance. In carving a turkey, place the head to the right, cut off the wing nearest you first, then the leg and second joint; then slice the breast until a rounded, ivory-shaped piece appears; insert the knife between that and the bone and separate them; this part is the nicest bit of the breast; next comes the "merry-thought." After this, turn over the bird a little, and just below the breast you will find the "oyster," which you can separate as you did the inner breast. The side bone lies beside the rump, and the desired morsel can be taken out without separating the whole bone. Proceed in the same way upon the other side. The fork need not be removed during the whole process. An experienced carver will dissect a fowl as easily as you can break an egg or cut a potato. He retains his seat, manages his hands and elbows artistically, and is perfectly at his ease. There is no difficulty in the matter; it only requires knowledge and practice, and these should be taught in the family, each child taking his turn. Chickens and partridges are carved in the same way. The trail of a woodcock on toast is the choicest bit of the bird; also the thigh of a partridge.</p><p>A fillet of veal is cut in thin, smooth slices off the top, and portions of the stuffing and fat are served to each. In cutting a breast of veal, separate the breast and brisket, and then cut them up.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a sirloin of beef with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>SIRLOIN OF BEEF.--In carving beef, mutton, lamb, and veal, thin, smooth and neat slices are desirable--<emph rend="italic">cut across the grain</emph> taking care to pass the knife through to the bones of the meat. There are two modes of helping a sirloin of beef; either by carving long, thin slices from 3 to 4, and helping it with a bit of the fat underneath the ribs, or by cutting thicker slices, from 1 to 2, through the tenderloin.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a shoulder of mutton with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>SHOULDER OF MUTTON.--A shoulder of mutton should be cut down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1, and then thin slices of lean taken from each side. The best fat is found at 2, and should be cut in thin slices in that direction. Several tempting slices can be cut on either side of the line 3, and there are nice bits on the under side near the flap.</p><pb n="376" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=371"/><illustration><description>An illustration of a ham with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>HAM.--A ham may be carved in three ways: first, by cutting long, delicate slices through the thick fat from 1 to 2, down to the bone; secondly, by running the point of the knife in the circle in the middle, and cutting thin circular slices, thus keeping the ham moist, and last, and most economically, by beginning at the knuckle 4-5 and slicing upward.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a leg of mutton with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>LEG OF MUTTON.--In carving a leg of mutton the best slices are obtained from the center, by cutting from 1 to 2; and some very good cuts are found on the broad end from 5 to 6. Some epicures prefer slices nearer the knuckle, but they are dry. The cramp-bone is a delicacy, and is obtained by cutting down to the bone at 4, and running the knife under it in a semicircular direction to 3. The fat so esteemed by many lies on the ridge 5. By turning over the meat some excellent slices are found, and can be cut lengthwise.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a tongue with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>TONGUE.--A tongue should be carved as "thin as a wafer;" its delicacy depending in a great degree upon that. A well-cut tongue tempts the most fastidious; and this applies, in fact, to all kinds of roast and boiled meats. A chunk of beef we turn from with disgust--an artistic slice we enjoy. The center slices of the tongue are considered the best, and should be cut across at the line 1, and the slices taken from each side, with a portion of the fat which is at its root, if it is liked. The question should be asked.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a haunch of venison with numbered sections refered to in the text for carving.</description></illustration><p>HAUNCH OF VENISON.--A haunch of venison should be cut across to the bone on the line 1-3-2, then turn the dish a little, and put the point of the knife at 3, and cut down as deep as possible in the direction of 3-4, and continue to cut slices on the right and left of the line. The fattest parts are found between 4 and 2. A loin of veal or a loin of mutton should be jointed by the butcher before it is cooked, and the carver easily cuts through the ribs. He should serve a portion of the kidney and the fat on each plate.</p><p>In serving fish, some practice is needful, for lightness of touch and dexterity of management are necessary to prevent the flakes from breaking. In serving mackerel, shad, etc., a part of the roe should be placed on each plate. The tins of the turbot are the most sought for; the fish is placed underpart upper-most on the platter, as there lies the primest part. In carving salmon, a portion of the back and belly should be served to each person. The choicest morsels are next to the head, the thin part comes next, and the tail is the least esteemed. The flavor of the fish nearest the bone is not equal to that on the upper part.</p></chapter>

It is not difficult to cut up beef, and is very easy to reduce any of the smaller animals to convenient proportions for domestic use, and in order to make the subject clear we present the accompanying engravings, the first of which represents the half of a beef, including, of course, the hind and fore quarters. The letters indicate the direction in which the cuts should be made, beginning in the order of the alphabet, cutting first from A to B, then C to D, etc. In the fore quarter cut from A to B, from B to C, from D to E, etc. For cutting, use a sharp, long, and pointed knife, and a saw of the best steel, sharp, and set for butcher's use. The beef should be laid on a bench or table with the inner side up. In hind quarter 1 represents the "rump," which is best corned; 2, "round," the under part of which makes steaks, the outside good corning pieces, or the whole may be used for dried beef; 3. "shank" for soups; 4, "rump steaks;" 5, "veiny piece" for dried beef or corning; 6, sirloin, the best steak; 7, flank for corning or stews; 8, porterhouse, the upper part of which is equal to sirloin. Cut in this way a part of the tenderloin, the choicest bit of the beef, lies in the sirloin, and a smaller part in the upper part of the porterhouse steak. In the fore quarter 1 is the "rib piece" for boiling or corning; 2, the "plate" piece for corning; 3, the "fore shank" for soup; 5, the "rib roast," first cut; 6, "rib roast," best cut, and the best roast in the beef; 7, "chuck rib roast," commonly used for "pot roast;" 8, neck piece, for corning or pie meat; 9, best cut for corn-beef.</p><pb n="378" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=373"/><illustration><description>An illustration of a young calf with lettered sections refered to below.</description></illustration><hd align="center">VEAL.</hd><p><list><item>A--Loin, best end, for roasting.</item><item>B--Loin, chump end, for roasting.</item><item>C--Fillet, for baking or roasting.</item><item>D--Knuckle, for stewing.</item><item>E--Fore knuckle, for stewing.</item><item>F--Neck, best end, for roasting.</item><item>G--Neck, scrag end, for stewing.</item><item>H--Blade bone.</item><item>I--Breast, for stewing.</item><item>K--Brisket, for stewing.</item></list></p><illustration><description>An illustration of a pig with lettered sections refered to below.</description></illustration><hd align="center">PORK.</hd><p><list><item>A--Back, lean part for roast.</item><item>B--Loin, for roast.</item><item>C--Bacon, to be cured.</item><item>D--Shoulder, to be cured.</item><item>E--Ham, to be cured.</item></list></p><illustration><description>An illustration of a lamb with lettered sections refered to below.</description></illustration><hd align="center">MUTTON.</hd><p><list><item>A--Leg, for boiling piece.</item><item>B--Loin, for roast.</item><item>C--Rump piece, for roast.</item><item>D--Chops, frying or broiling.</item><item>E--Fore shoulder, for boiling.</item><item>F--Neck, for stewing or roasting.</item><item>G--Brisket, for stewing.</item></list></p><p>HOW TO CUT UP PORK.--Split through the spine, cut off each half of head behind the ear, remove the pieces in front of the shoulder, for sausage. Take out <emph rend="italic">leaf</emph> which lies around kidneys for lard, cut out the lean meat, ribs, etc., then the ham and shoulder, and remove the loose piece directly in front of the ham, for lard. Cut off a narrow strip of the belly, for sausage, and cut up the remainder, which is clear pork, into five or six strips of about equal width, for salting down. Smoke the jowl with hams, and use the upper part of the head for boiling, baking, or head-cheese. Scorch the feet over the fire until the hoofs remove easily, scrape clean, place in hot water a few minutes, wash and scrape thoroughly, and they are ready for cooking. All the flabby pieces should be tried up for lard. Remove all fat from intestines saving that which does not easily come off the larger intestines for soap-grease. The liver, heart, sweetbreads, and kidneys are all used for boiling or frying, and the smaller intestines are sometimes used for sausage cases.</p>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p>No sloven can make good 
<purpose>butter.</purpose>
The <emph rend="italic">one thing</emph> to be kept in mind, morning, noon and night, is neatness, neatness, neatness. The milking should be done in the cleanest place that can be found, and the <ingredient>cows</ingredient> should be kept as clean as possible. Wash the teats and udders thoroughly with plenty of cold water, and wipe with a cloth or towel. Never wash with the hand moistened with milk from the cow. The least impurity taints the cream, and takes from the sweetness of the butter. Milk perfectly clean, (as the last quart is twice as rich in butter as the first,) and the quicker the milking is done the more milk is obtained. The milk-room should be clean and sweet, its air pure, and temperature about 62 degrees. As soon as a pail is filled, take to the milk-room and strain the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> through a fine <implement>wire-cloth strainer,</implement> kept for the purpose, and not attached to the pail (the simple strainer being more easily kept clean). Never allow milk to stand in the stable and cool, as it absorbs the foul odors of the place. The pans (flat <implement>stone crocks</implement> with flaring sides are better that tin pans. In winter <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> should be poured into them while milking is being done, and poured out just before straining the milk into them) should be set on slats, rather than shelves, as it is important to have the milk cooled from the animal heat as soon as possible. Skim each day, or at longest within twenty-four hours. Souring does not injure the quality of the cream, but the milk should not be allowed to become watery. Do not use a <implement>perforated skimmer,</implement> but remove a little of the milk with the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> as this does not injure the quality or lessen the quantity of butter, and gives more well-flavored buttermilk, which is a favorite and wholesome drink. If there is cream enough each day, it should, of course, be churned, and this plan makes the best <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> although it takes longer to churn it. If not, the cream should be set aside in a cool place, covered, and stirred thoroughly whenever more is added. It ought not to stand more than two days, and must not be allowed to become bitter and flaky. The best plan is to churn as soon as it becomes slightly acid. Scald the <implement>churn</implement> and dash thoroughly, and put in the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> at a temperature of 58 degrees. The motion of the <implement>churn</implement> will soon bring it up to about 60 degrees. When the butter comes put a quart or two of <ingredient>cold, soft water</ingredient> (or ice is better) into the <implement>churn</implement> to harden the butter, and make it easier to gather up. After gathering it as well as possible with the dash, it should be removed to the table or bowl, and thoroughly worked with a flat wooden paddle, (never with the hand, as the insensible perspiration will more or less taint the butter,) using an abundance of cold <emph rend="italic">soft</emph> water to wash out the buttermilk and harden the butter. By this process the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is removed quickly, and there is no need of excessive working, which injures the grain of the butter. This is especially true of that which is to be packed, as it keeps longer when well washed. If to be used immediately, the washing may be less thorough. Another and better plan is to remove the butter to a marble slab and lay on the top of it a piece of <ingredient>ice.</ingredient> As it settles down by its own weight, work it up around the edges with the paddle, and the water from the melting ice will wash out and carry off the buttermilk. Before or during the churning, the bowl (which should never be used for any thing else) in which the butter is to be salted should be filled with <ingredient>scalding water,</ingredient> which should remain for ten minutes; pour out and rub both bowl and<pb n="384" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=379"/>
paddle with <ingredient>hard coarse salt,</ingredient> which prevents butter from sticking. Rinse thoroughly and fill with <ingredient>cold or ice-water</ingredient> to cool. After washing butter free from milk, remove to this bowl, having first poured out the <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and (the butter-bowl and paddle should occasionally be scoured with <ingredient>sand or ashes,</ingredient> washed thoroughly with <ingredient>soap-suds,</ingredient> and rinsed until all smell of soap has disappeared,) work in gradually salt which has been pulverized by rolling, and freed from foreign substances. If wanted for use, one-half ounce of salt> to the pound of butter is sufficient, but if wanted for packing, use three-fourths of an ounce or even an ounce of salt. Use only the best quality of <ingredient>dairy salt.</ingredient> After salting, cover with cotton cloth soaked in <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> and set away in a temperature of about 60 degrees for twelve hours. Work the second time just enough to get the remaining buttermilk out. This, however, must be done thoroughly, as otherwise the acid of the buttermilk will make the butter rancid. At the end of the second working it is ready for use, and should be kept in a clean, sweet place, as it soon absorbs bad odors and becomes tainted. The air of a cellar in which are decaying vegetables soon ruins the sweetest butter. <variation><purpose>In packing for market,</purpose> (ash butter-tubs are the neatest and best packages,) soak the package for twelve hours in brine strong enough to float an egg, pack the butter in evenly and firmly, having first put in a thin layer of salt. If the tub is not filled by the first packing, set away until next churning, in a cool place, with a cotton cloth wet in brine spread over the butter, and place cover carefully on the tub. When filled, lay over the butter a cotton cloth (from which the sizing has been washed) soaked in strong brine, nail up the tub, and set away in a clean, cool place until ready to sell.</variation></p>
<p><variation><purpose>In packing for family use,</purpose> work into rolls, lay in large <implement>stone crocks,</implement> cover with brine strong enough to float an egg, in which a level tea-spoon of <ingredient>saltpeter</ingredient> and a pound of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> to each two gallons have been added; over it place a cotton cloth and a weight to keep the butter under the brine, and tie a paper over the top of <implement>crock.</implement> Or pack in a stone jar, pressing it solid with a <implement>wooden pestle,</implement> cover with a cloth wet in brine, and sprinkle over it salt an inch thick. When ready to pack the next churning, remove the cloth with the salt carefully, rinsing off with <ingredient>water</ingredient> any that may have been scattered in uncovering it, pack butter as before, replace cloth with salt over it, and repeat until jar is filled to within two inches of the top, cover all with cloth, add salt to the top of <implement>crock,</implement> tie paper over the top and set in a cool place. In removing for use each churning comes out by itself.</variation></p></recipe>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><pb n="385" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=380"/><hd align="center" size="larger">THE LAUNDRY.</hd><p>When removed from the person, clothing, if damp, should be dried to prevent mildew, and articles which are to be starched should be mended before placing in the clothes-basket. Monday is the washing day with all good housekeepers. The old-fashioned programme for a washing is as follows: Use good soft water if it can be had. If not, soften a barrel-full of well-water by pouring into it water in which half a peck or more of hard wood ashes have been boiled, together with the ashes themselves. When enough has been added to produce the desired effect, the water takes on a curdled appearance, and soon settles perfectly clear. If milky, more ashes and lye must be added as before, care being taken not to add more than is necessary to clear the water, or it will effect the hands unpleasantly. On the other hand, if too little is put in the clothes will turn yellow. Gather up all clothes which are ready on Saturday night, and the rest as they are taken off; separate the fine from the coarse, and the less soiled from the dirtier. Scald all table linen and articles which have coffee, fruit or other stains which would be "set" by hot suds, by pouring over them hot water from the tea-kettle and allowing them to stand until cool. Have the water in the tub as warm as the hand will bear, but not too hot. (Dirty clothes should never be put into very hot clear water, as it "sets" the dirt. Hot soap-suds, however, has the opposite effect, the water expanding the fiber of the fabric, while the alkali of the soap softens and removes the dirt.) Wash them, taking the cleanest and finest first, through two suds, then place in a <implement>boiler</implement> of cold water, with soap enough to make a good suds. (A handful of borax added to the water helps to whiten the clothes and is used by many, especially by the Germans, who are famous for their snowy linen.) Let them boil not more than five or ten minutes, as too long boiling "yellows" the clothes. Remove to a tub, pour over them cold water slightly blued, and turn all garments, pillow-slips, stockings, etc., wrong-side out. If there are more to boil, take out part of the boiling suds, add cold water, and fill not too full with clothes. Repeat until all are boiled. The removal of part of the suds, and filling up with cold water, prevents the suds from "yellowing" the clothes. Wash vigorously in this water, wringing very dry by hand, or better with the wringer, as the clear appearance of the clothes depends largely on thorough wringing. Rinse in another tub of soft water, washing with the hands, <emph rend="italic">not</emph> simply lifting them out of the water and then wringing, as is practiced by some, because all suds must be rinsed out to make them clear and white. Wring out again from water pretty well blued, dipping only one<pb n="386" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=381"/>article at a time, as the blue sometimes settles to the bottom, and thus spots the clothes. (This time well-water may be used if soft water is difficult to obtain.) Wring out again and for the last time, placing the clothes which are to be starched in one basket, and the rest, which may be hung out immediately, in another. Have the starch (see recipes) ready as hot as the hand can bear, dip the articles and parts of articles which need to be very stiff, first, "clapping" the starch well in with the hands, especially in shirt-bosoms, wristbands and collars, and then thin the starch for other articles which require less stiffening. When starched, hang out on the line to dry, first wiping the line with a cloth to remove all dirt and stains. Shake out each article until it is free from wrinkles, and fasten securely on the line (with the old-fashioned split clothes-pins), being careful to hang sheets and table-linen so that the selvage edges will be even. The line should be stretched in the airiest place in the yard, or in winter a large attic is a better place for the purpose. (Freezing injures starch, and for that reason it is better in winter to hang clothes out unstarched until dry, then taking in, starching and drying indoors.) When dry remove from line to clothes-basket, place clothes-pins as removed in a basket kept for the purpose, take down and roll up the line, remove basket, line and pins to the house, and put the two latter into their proper places. Turn all garments right side out, shake out thoroughly, sprinkle (re-starching shirt-bosoms, wristbands and collars if necessary). Shake out night dresses and under-garments so as to free them from creases, and if they are ruffled or embroidered, dip them in thin starch, pull out smoothly, fold first, and then, beginning at the top of each garment, roll up, each by itself, in a very tight roll, and place in the basket; fold sheets without sprinkling, having first snapped and stretched them, and lay on the rest; over all spread the ironing blanket, and let them stand until next morning. Next day iron, beginning with the sheets (which, as well as table linen, must be folded neatly and carefully, so that the selvage edges will exactly come together), and taking shirts next, cooling the iron when too hot on the coarse towels. In ironing shirts a <implement>"bosom-board"</implement> is almost indispensable, and an "ironing-board" is a great convenience for all articles. The former is a hard wood board an inch thick, eighten inches long, and eight wide, covered with two thicknesses of woolen blanket stuff, overlaid with two more of cotton cloth. The cloth is wrapped over the sides and ends of the board and tacked on the back side, leaving the face plain and smooth. The ironing-board is covered in the same way, but is five feet long, two feet wide at one end, and narrowed down with a rounded taper from full width at the middle to seven inches at the other end, and the corners rounded. This board may be of any well-seasoned wood which will not warp, and should be about one inch thick; on this all the clothes are conveniently ironed. Always use cotton holders for the irons. Woolen ones are hot to the hand, and if scorched, as they often are, the smell is disagreeable.<pb n="387" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=382"/>
In ironing a shirt or a dress, turn the sleeves on the wrong side, and leave them until the rest is done, and then turn and iron them. In this way the bosoms are less likely to become rumpled. Pull muslin and lace out carefully, iron it over once, and then pull into shape, pick out the embroidery and proceed with greater care than before. Embroideries should be ironed on the wrong side over flannel. Always have near a dish of clean cold water, so that any spot which has been imperfectly ironed may be easily wet, with a soft sponge or piece of linen, and ironed over again, or any surplus bit of starch removed. As fast as articles are finished, they should be hung on the clothes-dryer until thoroughly dry, especial care being taken with those which are starched stiff, as they retain the starch much better if dried very quickly.</p><p>If a machine is used in washing, it is better to soak the clothes over night in warm soft water, soaping collars and wristbands, and pieces most soiled. Have separate tube for coarse and fine clothes. In soaking clothes for washing Monday, the water should be prepared Saturday night, and all clothes which are ready thrown in, and the rest added when changed. If washing fluids are used, the recipes which follow are the best.</p><p>Another method is to half fill tubs Saturday night with clear, soft water, warmed a little if convenient, but not hot; in one put the finer articles, such as muslins, cuffs, collars and shirts; in another put table-linen; in another bed-linen; in another the dish-cloths and wiping-towels, and in still another the coarsest and most soiled articles; cover all well with water and press down. Rub no soap in the water, as it may "set" spots or stains. Of course, articles which can not be had on Saturday night are put in the next day as they are changed. Monday morning, heat not very hot a <implement>boiler</implement> full of clean soft water, add to it water in which soap was dissolved Saturday night by pouring hot water over it, and stir it thoroughly; drain off the water in which the clothes were soaked after shaking them up and down vigorously in it, pressing them against the sides of the tub to get out all the water possible. Then pour over them the warm suds, and wash out as before described, washing each class separately. If found impracticable to make so many divisions, separate the coarse and fine, and the least soiled and the dirtiest.</p><p>In the summer clothes may be washed without any fire by soaking overnight in soapy soft water, rubbing out in the morning, soaping the dirty places, and laying them in the hot sunshine. By the time the last are spread out to bleach, the first may be taken up, washed out and rinsed. This, of course, requires a clean lawn.</p><p>In washing flannels use soft <emph rend="italic">clean, cold</emph> water, in winter merely taking the chill off. Let the hard soap, lie in the water, but do not apply it to the clothes. Wash the white pieces first, throw articles as fast as washed into blued cold water, let them stand twenty or thirty minutes, wash them<pb n="388" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=383"/>through this water after dissolving a little soap in it, wring hard, shake and hang up. Never dry in the house. If they freeze, so much the better. In warm weather hang in the shade out of doors. Wash colored flannels in the same way (but not in water used for white, or they will gather the lint), and rinse in several waters if inclined to "run." When very dirty, all flannels should soak longer, and a little borax well dissolved should be added to the water. This process is equally good for washing silk goods and silk embroideries. Calicoes and fancy cotton stockings may be washed in the same way, except that no soap should be used in the rinsing. Wash gray and brown linens in cold water, with a little black pepper in it, and they will not fade.</p>

<p>SOAP FOR FAMILY USE.--Much of the toilet and laundry soaps in the market are adulterated with injurious, and, to some persons, poisonous substances, by which diseases of the skin are occasioned or greatly aggravated, and great suffering results, which is rarely traced to the real cause. The fat tried from animals which have died of disease, if not thoroughly saponified, is poisonous, and sometimes produces death. If in making soap the mass is heated to too high a degree, a film of soap forms around the particles of fat; if at this stage resin, sal-soda, silicate, and other adulterations are added, the fat is not saponified, but filmed, and if poisonous or diseased it so remains, and is dangerous to use. A bar of such soap has an oily feeling, and is unfit for use. If it feels sticky, it has too much resin in it. The slippery feeling which belongs to soap properly made can not be mistaken. Another test of pure soft or hard soap is its translucent or semi-transparent appearance. Soft soap> that is cloudy is not thoroughly saponified, or else has been made of dirty or impure grease. It is not only safer but more economical to buy pure soap, as the adulterations increase the quantity without adding to the erasive power. Some of the brown soaps sold in the market are seventy-five per cent. resin, and the buyer gets only twenty-five per cent of what he wants for his money. Fifteen per cent. of resin improves the quality, but any excess damages it, and is worse than useless. <variation>Almost any family may

<p>TO DRY-STARCH, FOLD AND IRON SHIRTS.--In doing up shirts, wristbands and collars should be starched first if the collars are sewed on. Dip them into the hot starch, and as soon as the hand can bear the heat (and dipping the hand in cold water often will expedite the work) rub the starch in very thoroughly, taking care that no motes or lumps of starch adhere to the linen. Then starch the shirt-bosom the same way, keeping the starch hot all the time by setting the dish in a deep pan of water. Rub it into the linen very carefully, pass the finger under the plaits and raise them up so that the starch shall penetrate all through evenly. Some rub it into the plaits with a piece of clean linen, but we think the hand does the work more thoroughly and evenly. When perfectly starched, shake out the shirt evenly, fold both sides of the bosom together and bring the shoulders and side seams together evenly; that will lay the sleeves one over the other, and after pulling the wristbands into shape smoothly they can thus be folded together and the wristbands rolled tightly and, with the sleeves; be folded and laid even on the sides of the shirt. Then turn the sides with the sleeves over on the front, and beginning at the neck roll the whole tightly together,<pb n="390" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=385"/>wrap in a towel and let it remain so several hours before ironing--all night if starched and folded in the evening--and in the summer put in a cool place where the starch will not sour, and in the winter keep warm enough to prevent freezing. To do up shirt-bosoms in the most perfect way, one must have a "polishing iron"--a small iron rounded over and highly polished on the ends and sides. Spread the bosom on a hard and very smooth board, with only one thickness of cotton cloth sewed tight across it. Spread a wet cloth over and iron quickly with a hot iron, then remove the cloth and with a polishing iron, as hot as it can be used without scorching, rub the bosom quick and hard up and down, not crosswise. Use only the rounded part of the front of the iron, that puts all the friction on a small part at one time, and gives the full benefit of all the gloss in starch or linen.<emph rend="italic">--Mrs. Beecher in Christian Union.</emph></p>

<p>HOW TO DO UP SHIRT-BOSOMS.--<variation>Take two table-spoons best 
<purpose>starch,</purpose>
add a very little <ingredient>water</ingredient> to it, rub and stir with a spoon into a thick paste, carefully breaking all the lumps and particles. Add a pint of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> stirring at the same time; boil half an hour, stirring occasionally to keep it from burning. Add a piece of <ingredient>"Enamel"</ingredient> the size of a pea; if this is not at hand use a table-spoon <ingredient>gum-arabic</ingredient> solution (made by pouring boiling water upon gum-arabic and standing until clear and transparent), or a piece of <ingredient>clean mutton tallow</ingredient> half the size of a nutmeg and a tea-spoon of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will do, but is not as good.

Three hours before ironing dip the bosoms in clean water; wring out and roll up tightly. First iron the back by folding it lengthwise through the center; next iron the wristbands, and both sides of the sleeves; then the collar-band; now place the <implement>bosom-board</implement> under the bosom, and with a dampened napkin rub the bosom from the top towards the bottom, smoothing and arranging each plait neatly. With smooth, moderately hot <implement>flat-iron,</implement> begin at the top and iron downwards, and continue the operation until the bosom is perfectly dry and shining. Remove the <implement>bosom-board,</implement> and iron the front of the shirt. The bosoms and cuffs of shirts, indeed, of all nice, fine work, will look clearer and better if they are first ironed under a piece of thin old muslin. It takes off the first heat of the iron, and removes any lumps of starch.</p></formula>
<p>CARE OF IRONS.--When irons become rough or smoky, lay a little fine salt on a flat surface and rub them well; it will prevent them sticking to any thing starched, and make them smooth; or scour with bath-brick before heating, and when hot rub well with salt, and then with a small piece of beeswax tied up in a rag, after which wipe clean on a dry cloth. A piece of fine sandpaper is also a good thing to have near the stove, or a hard, smooth board covered with brick dust, to rub each iron on when it is put back on the stove, so that no starch may remain to be burnt on. Put beeswax between pieces of paper or cloth and keep on the table close by the <implement>flat-iron</implement> stand. If the irons get coated with scorched starch, rub them over the paper that holds the starch and it will all come off. Rubbing the iron over the waxed paper, even if no starch adheres, adds to the glossiness of the linen that is ironed.</p><p>TO TAKE OUT SCORCH.--If a shirt-bosom, or any other article, has been scorched in ironing, lay it where bright sunshine will fall directly on it. It will take it entirely out.</p>

<p>TO WASH FLANNELS IN BOILING WATER.--Make a strong suds of boiling water and soft soap--hard soap makes flannels stiff and wiry--put them in, pressing them down under the water with a clothes stick; when cool enough rub the articles carefully between the hands, then wring--but not through the wringer--as dry as possible, shake, snap out, and pull each piece into its original size and shape, then throw immediately into another tub of boiling water, in which you have thoroughly mixed some nice bluing. Shake them up and down in this last water with a clothes stick until cool enough for the hands, then rinse well, wring, shake out and pull into shape--the snapping and pulling are as necessary as the washing--and hang in a sunny place where they will dry quickly. Many prefer to rinse in two waters with the bluing in the last, and this is always advisable when there are many flannels.</p><p>TO WASH FLANNELS IN TEPID WATER.--The usefulness of liquid ammonia is not as universally known among housewives as it deserves to be. If you add some of it to a soap-suds made of a mild soap, it will prevent the flannel from becoming yellow or shrinking. It is the potash and soda contained in sharp soap which tends to color animal fibers yellow; the shrinking may also be partially due to this agency, but above all to the exposure of the flannel while wet to the extremes of low or high temperatures. Dipping it in boiling water or leaving it out in the rain will also cause it to<pb n="392" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=387"/>shrink and become hard. To preserve their softness flannels should be washed in tepid suds, rinsed in tepid water, and dried rapidly at a moderate heat.</p><p>HOW TO WASH BLANKETS.--All that is necessary is abundance of soft water, and soap without resin in it. Resin hardens the fibers of wool, and should never be used in washing any kind of flannel goods. Blankets treated as above will always come out clean and soft. A little bluing may be used in washing white blankets.<contributor rend="italic">--North Star Woolen Mill, Minneapolis, Minn.</contributor></p><p>Blankets should be shaken and snapped until almost dry; it will require two persons to handle them. Woolen shawls, and all woolen articles, especially men's wear, are much improved by being pressed with a hot iron under damp muslin.</p><p>TO WASH LACE CURTAINS.--Shake the dust well out of the lace, put in tepid water, in which a little soda has been dissolved, and wash at once carefully with the hands in several waters, or until perfectly clean; rinse in water well blued, also blue the boiled starch quite deeply and squeeze, but do not wring. Pin some sheets down to the carpet in a vacant, airy room, then pin on the curtains stretched to exactly the size they were before being wet. In a few hours they will be dry and ready to put up. The whole process of washing and pinning down should occupy as little time as possible, as lace will shrink more than any other cotton goods when long wet. Above all it should not be allowed to "soak" from the mistaken idea that it washes more easily, nor should it ever be ironed. Another way is to fasten them in a pair of frames, which every housekeeper should have, made very like the old-fashioned quilting-frames, thickly studded along the inside with the smallest size of galvanized tenter hooks, in which to fasten the lace, and having holes and wooden pins with which to vary the length and breadth to suit the different sizes of curtains. The curtains should always be measured before being wet, and stretched in the frames to that size to prevent shrinking. Five or six curtains of the same size may be put in, one above the other, and all dried at once. The frames may rest on four chairs.</p><p>TO WASH LACE RUCHINGS.--Wash with the hands in warm suds (if much soiled, soak in warm water two or three hours), rinse thoroughly and starch in thick starch, dry out doors if the day be clear; if not place between dry cloth, roll tightly and put away till dry, then with the fingers, open each row and pull out smoothly (have a cup of clean water in which to dip the fingers or dampen the lace), then pull out straight the outer edge of each with the thumb and finger and draw the binding over the point or side of a hot iron. If the ruche is single or only two rows, it can be ironed after being smoothed (the first process). Blonde or net that has become yellow can be bleached by hanging in the sun or lying out over night in the dew.</p><p>TO WASH THREAD LACE.--Cover a bottle with white flannel, base the lace carefully on the flannel and rub with white soap; place the bottle in a jar filled with warm suds, let remain two or three days changing the water several times, and boil with the finest white clothes on washing day; when cooled a little, rinse several times in plenty of cold water, wrap a soft dry towel around it and place in the sun; when dry, unwind, but do not starch.</p><p>TO WASH A SILK DRESS.--To wash a silk dress with gall soap, rip apart and shake off the dust; have ready two tubs warm soft water, make a suds of the soap in one tub, and use the other for rinsing, wash the silk, one piece at a time, in the suds, wring gently, rinse, again wring, shake out, and iron with a hot iron on what you intend to be the wrong side. Thus proceed with each piece, and when about half done throw out the suds and make suds of the rinsing water, using fresh water for rinsing.</p><pb n="393" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=388"/>
<p>TO PREVENT BLUE FROM FADING.--To prevent blue from fading, put an ounce of sugar of lead into a pail of water, soak the material in the solution for two hours, and let dry before being washed and ironed; good for all shades of blue.</p><p>TO WASH COLORED MUSLINS.--Wash in warm (not hot) suds, made with soft wate and best white soap, if it is to be had. Do not soak them, and wash only one thing at a time. Change the suds as soon as it looks dingy, and put the garments at once into fresh suds. Rinse first in clear water, then in slightly blued. Squeeze quite dry, but don't <emph rend="italic">wring</emph> the dress. Hang in a shady place where the sunshine will not strike it, as that fades all colors.</p><p>TO WASH DELICATE COLORED MUSLINS.--Boil wheat bran (about two quarts to a dress), in soft water half an hour, let it cool, strain the liquor, and use it instead of soap-suds; it removes dirt like soap, keeps the color, and the clothes only need rinsing in one water, and even starching is unnecessary. Suds and rinsing water for colored articles should be used as cold as possible. Another way is to make thick corn meal mush, well salted, and use instead of soap; rinse in one or two waters, and do not starch.<contributor rend="italic">--Miss Juana James, West Killingly, Conn.</contributor></p><p>TO BLEACH MUSLIN.--For thiry yrads of muslin, take one pound of chloride of lime, dissolve in two quarts rain water; let cloth soak over night in warm rain water, or long enough to be thoroughly wet; wring out cloth and put in another tub of warm rain water in which the chloride of lime solution has been poured. Let it remain for about twenty minutes, lifting up the cloth and airing every few moments, and rinse in clear rain water. This will not injure the cloth in the least, and is much less troublesome than bleaching on the grass.</p><p>Or, scald in suds and lay them on the clean grass all night, or if this can not be done, bring in and place in a tub of clean soft water. In the morning scald again and put out as before. It will take from one to two weeks to bleach white. May be bleached in winter by placing on snow. May is the best month for bleaching. To whiten yellow linens or muslins, soak over-night or longer in buttermilk, rinse thoroughly and wash the same as other clothes. This will also answer for light calicoes, percales, lawns, etc., that will not fade. Some use sour milk when not able to procure buttermilk. To whiten yellow laces, old collars, etc., put in a glass bottle or jar in a strong suds, let stand in sun for seven days, shaking occasionally.</p><p>BROWN LINEN--May be kept looking new until worn out if always washed in starch water and hay tea. Make flour starch in the ordinary way. For one dress put on the stove a common sized <implement>milk pan</implement> full of timothy hay, pour on water, cover, and boil until the water is of a dark green color, then turn into the starch, let the goods soak in it a few minutes, and wash without soap; the starch will clean the fabric, and no rinsing is necessary.</p><p>TO CLEANSE ARTICLES MADE OF WHITE ZEPHYER.--Rub in flour or magnesia, changing often. Shake off flour and hang in the open air a short time.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. A. S. C.</contributor></p><p>HOW TO CLEAN VELVET.--Invert a hot <implement>flatiron,</implement> place over it a single thickness of wet cotton cloth, lay on this the velvet, wrong side next the wet cloth, rub gently with a dry cloth until the pile is well raised; take off the iron, lay on a table, and brush it with a soft brush or cloth.<contributor rend="italic">--Miss Alice McAllister.</contributor></p><p>TO CLEAN RIBBONS.--Dissolve white soap in boiling water; when cool enough to bear the hand, pass the ribbons through it, rubbing gently, so as not to injure the texture; rinse through lukewarm water, and pin on a board to dry. If the colors are bright yellow, maroon, crimson, or scarlet, add a<pb n="394" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=389"/>few drops of oil of vitriol to the rinse-water; if the color is bright scarlet, add to the rinse-water a few drops of the muriate of tin.</p><p>TO TAKE OUT PAINT.--Equal parts of ammonia and spirits of turpentine will take paint out of clothing, no matter how dry or hard it may be. Saturate the spot two or three times and then wash out in soap-suds.</p><p>TO REMOVE INK-STAIN.--Immediately saturate with milk, soak it up with a rag, apply more, rub well, and in a few minutes the ink will disappear.</p><p>TO TAKE GREASE OUT OF SILKS, WOOLENS, PAPER, FLOORS, ETC.--Grate thick over the spot French (or common will do) chalk, cover with brown paper, set on it a hot <implement>flatiron,</implement> and let it remain until cool; repeat if necessary. The iron must not be so hot as to burn paper or cloth.</p><p>SUBSTITUTE FOR WASHING-SODA.--A German scientific journal recommends laundresses to use hyposulphite of soda in place of common washing-soda. It does not attack the fabric in any way, and at the same time exerts some bleaching actions which greatly improve the appearance of linen and calicoes.</p><p>FRUIT-STAINS.--Colored cottons or woolens stained with wine or fruit should be wet in alcohol and ammonia, then sponged off gently (not rubbed) with alcohol; after that, if the material will warrant it, washed in tepid soap-suds. Silks may be wet with this preparation when injured by these stains.</p><p>TO WASH WOOLEN GOODS.--Many woolen goods, such as light-colored, heavy sacques, nubias, etc., may be washed in cold suds and rinsed in cold water. The garments should be well shaken out and pulled into shape.</p><p>In ironing woolen goods, especially pants, vests, etc., it is well to let them get dried, then spread them out on an ironing-board (not on a table), wring a cloth out of clear water and lay over the article, then iron with a hot iron till dry; wet the cloth again and spread it just above the part already ironed, but let it come a half inch or so on that which has been pressed, so that there will be no line to mark where the cloth was moved; conitnue this till the whole garment has been thoroughly pressed. Woolen garments thus ironed will look like new; but in doing this care must be exercised that every spot that looks at all "fulled" or shrunk should be stretched while being pressed under the wet cloth. Bring the outside to fit the linings, as when new, but if not quite able to do this rip the lining and trim off to match. All the seams, especially on pants, must be first pressed on a "press board," then fold the pants as they are found in the tailor's shop, and go over them with the wet cloth and hot iron.</p><p>TO REMOVE THE COLOR FROM BUFF CALICO.--If some kinds of buff calico be dipped in strong soda water, the color will be removed and the figures of other colors remain on a white ground. This is valuable sometimes, as buff calico spots easily. If pink calico be dipped in vinegar and water after rinsing, the color will be brighter.</p><p>TO REMOVE IRON-RUST.--While rinsing clothes, take such as have spots of rust, wring out, dip a wet finger in oxalic acid, and rub on the spot, then dip in salt and rub on, and hold on a warm <implement>flatiron,</implement> or on the tin or copper tea-kettle if it have hot water in it, and the spot will immediately disappear; rinse again, rubbing the place a little with the hands.</p><p>TO REMOVE THE STAIN OF NITRATE OF SILVER--From the flesh, or white goods of any kind, dissolve iodine in alcohol, and apply to the stain; then take a piece of cyanide potassium, size of hickory-nut, wet in water, rub on the spot, and the stain will immediately disappear; then wash the goods or hands in cold water.<contributor rend="italic">--G.

To press and clean black silk, shake out all the dust, clean well with a flannel cloth, rubbing it up and down over the silk; this takes out all dust that may be left; take some good lager beer and sponge the silk, both on the wrong and right side, sponging across the width of the silk, and not down the length, and with a moderately-warm iron, press what is intended for the wrong side.

<chapter class1="foodandnonfood"><pb n="396" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=391"/><hd align="center" size="larger">THE CELLAR AND ICE-HOUSE.</hd><p>The cellar, when properly constructed and cared for, is the most useful room in the house, and no dwelling is complete without one. It is economy of expense and ground-space to build it under ground, and this plan gives the best cellar whenever the site of the house permits thorough drainage. The base of the foundation-wall of the house should be laid a little below the floor-level of the cellar, and the first layer should be of broad flag-stones, so placed that the edges will project a few inches beyond the outer face of the wall. This effectually prevents rats from undermining the cement floor, which they often do when this precaution is neglected, digging away the dirt until the floor breaks and gives them access to a new depot of supplies. In burrowing downwards, they invariably keep close to the wall, and when they reach the projecting flagging, give it up and look for an easier job. To secure the cellar from freezing, the wall, above the level of the deepest frost, should be double or "hollow," the inner wall being of brick four inches thick, with an air-space of two inches between it and the outer wall, which should be of stone and twelve or fourteen inches thick. The brick wall should be stiffened by an occasional "binder" across to the stone. The hollow space may be filled with dry tan-bark or sawdust, or left simply filled with the confined air, "dead air" being the most perfect non-conductor of heat known. The windows, which should be opposite each other when possible, to secure a "draft" and more perfect ventilation, should be provided with double sash, one flush with the outer face of the wall, which may be removed in summer, and the other flush with the inner face, hung on strong hinges, so that it may easily be swung open upward and hooked there. In winter, this arrangement lets in light, but with its space of confined air, keeps out the frost. A frame covered with wire-netting should take the place of the outer sash in summer, to keep out every thing but the fresh air and light. The walls should be as smooth as possible on the inner side, and neatly plastered; also the ceiling overhead. The floor should be first paved with small stones, then a coat of water-lime laid on, and over this a second coat, as level as a planed floor. There should also be double doors, one flush with each face of the wall; and a wide out-door stairway, through which vegetables, coal, etc., may be carried, is indispensable. The depth should be about eight feet.</p><p>Such a cellar may always be clean, the air pure, and the temperature under complete control. It will consequently keep apples and pears two or three months longer than an ordinary cellar, prolonging the fruit season to "strawberry-time." If it extends under the whole house--the best plan<pb n="397" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=392"/>when the state of the purse permits it--it may be divided into apartments, with brick walls between, one for vegetables, one for fruits, one for provisions, one for the laundry, and a fifth for coal and the furnace, if one is used. In one corner of the cellar, under the kitchen, may also be the cistern, the strong cellar wall serving for its outer wall. A pump from the kitchen would supply water there for domestic uses; and a pipe with a stop-cock, leading through the wall into the cellar, would occasionally be a convenience and save labor. It is better, however, as a rule to locate the cistern just outside the house, passing a pipe from it through the cellar wall below the deepest frost level, and thence to the kitchen. If built in the cellar, the cistern should be square, with heavy walls, plastered inside with three coats of water lime.</p>
<p>All the apartments of a cellar should be easily accessible from the outside door and from the kitchen stairway. In the vegetable apartment, the bins should be made of dressed lumber, and painted, and located in the center, with a walk around each, so that the contents may easily be examined and assorted. The fruit shelves, made of slats two inches wide and placed one inch apart, should be put up with equal care and neatness, and with equal regard for convenience and easy access. Their place should be the most airy part of the cellar; the proper width is about two feet, and the distance apart about one foot, with the lowest shelf one foot from the floor. Pears will ripen nicely on the lower shelves under a cover of woolen blankets. The supports should, of course, be firm and strong. The bottom shelf should be of one board, on which to scatter fine fresh lime to the depth of an inch, changing it two or three times during the winter. A shelf, suspended firmly from the ceiling, and located where it will be easy of access from the kitchen, on which to place cakes, pies, meats, and any thing that needs to be kept cool and safe from cats and mice, is an absolute necessity. Its height prevents the articles placed on it from becoming damp, and gathering mold, as they sometimes do when placed on the cellar floor. In planning shelves for cans, <implement>crocks,</implement> <implement>casks,</implement> etc., regard should be had to economy of space by making the distance between the shelves correspond to the articles to stand on them, and it is well to so place the lower shelf that the meat barrels, etc., may be placed under it. The temperature of a cellar should never be below freezing, and if it is raised above fifty by a fire, outside air should be admitted to lower it. The best time for ventilating the cellar is at noon, taking care in hot weather not to admit so much outside air as to render it warm. A simple and excellent plan for ventilation, where the location of the kitchen chimney admits it, is to pass an ordinary stove-pipe through the floor upward beside or behind the pipe of the kitchen stove, and thence by an elbow into the chimney. The draft of the chimney will carry off all the impure air that arises in the cellar, and if too great a current is created it may be brought under complete control by a valve at the floor.</p><pb n="398" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=393"/><p>The cellar must be frequently examined and kept perfectly sweet and clean. There is no reason why it should not be as neat as the living rooms, and as free from cobwebs, decayed fruit and vegetables, and all other forms of filthiness. Whitewashing walls in winter will aid in giving it tidiness.</p><p>If the cellar is constructed above ground, the entire walls should be double, with air space between, double windows and doors being even more necessary than when under-ground. Above all, the floor should be on a level with that of the kitchen, to save the woman-killing stairs. If there are stairs, let them be broad, firm, and placed in the light if possible. Of course every cellar should have thorough drainage. In laying a tile drain, if in the horse-shoe form, place the circular side down; the narrower the channel the swifter the current and more certain to carry off sediment.</p>
<section><hd align="center">THE ICE-HOUSE.</hd><p>Ice is one of the greatest of summer luxuries, and indeed is almost a necessity. It is so easily put up, even in the country, and so cheaply protected, that there is no reason why any one who is able to own or rent a house may not have it in liberal supply. A cheap ice-house may be made by partitioning off a space about twelve feet square in the wood-shed, or even in the barn. The roof must be tight over it, but there is no necessity for matched or fine lumber for the walls. They should, however, be coated with coal-tar inside, as the long continued moisture puts them to a severe test and brings on decay. Ice should be taken from still places in running streams, or from clear ponds. It may be cut with half an old cross-cut saw, but there are saws and ice-plows made for the purpose to be had in almost every village. In cutting ice, as soon as it is of sufficient thickness and before much warm weather, select a still day, with the thermometer as near zero as may be. Ice handles much more comfortably and easily when it is so cold that it immediately freezes dry, thus preventing the wet clothes and mittens, which are the sole cause of any suffering in handling it; and ice put up in sharp, cold weather, before it has been subjected to any thaw, will keep much better and be much more useful in the hot days of summer than if its packing had been delayed until late winter or early spring, and then the ice put up half melted and wet. The best simple contrivance for removing blocks of ice from the water is a plank with a cleat nailed across one end, which is to be slipped under the block, which slides against the cleat and may then be easily drawn out with the plank, without lifting. Cut the ice in large blocks of equal size, pack as closely as possible in layers, leaving about a foot space between the outside and the wall, and filling all crevices between the blocks with pounded ice or sawdust. Under the first layer there should be placed sawdust a foot thick, and arrangements should be made for thorough drainage, as water in contact with the ice will melt it rapidly. As the layers are put in place, pack saw-dust closely between the mass of ice and the wall; and when<pb n="399" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=394"/>all is stored, cover with a foot, at least, of sawdust. In using ice, be careful to cover all crevices with sawdust, as the ice will melt rapidly if exposed to the air. The less ventilation and the more completely an ice-house is kept closed, the better the ice will keep. The cold air which surrounds the ice, if undisturbed by currents, has little effect on it; but if there are openings, currents are formed and the warm air is brought in to replace the cold. This is especially the case if the openings are low, as the cold air, being the heavier, passes out below most readily. For this reason great care must be taken to fill in fresh saw-dust between the walls and the mass of ice as it settles down by its own weight and the melting of the ice. There is no advantage in having an ice-house wholly or partly under ground, if it is constructed as directed above. Fine chaff, or straw cut fine, may be substituted for sawdust when the latter is difficult to obtain. Of course, the building may be constructed separately, in which case the cost need not be more than twenty-five to fifty dollars.</p></section>

<purpose>WHITEWASH FOR CELLARS.</purpose>
--An ounce of <ingredient>carbolic acid</ingredient> to a gallon of <ingredient>whitewash</ingredient> will keep from cellars the disagreeable odor which taints milk and meat. Added to paste and mucilage, it prevents mold.</p></formula>
<p>TO KEEP PARSLEY FRESH AND GREEN.--Put it in a strong boiling hot pickle of salt and water, and keep for use. Hang up and dry in bunches, blossom downward, in a dry attic or store-room, for use in soups, stuffing, etc.</p><p>TO KEEP CELLAR CLEAN.--Remove all vegetables as soon as they begin to decay, and ventilate well so that the walls will not become foul. Use cloride of lime as a disinfectant freely, after taking care to make it as neat and clean as possible.</p><p>THE TEMPERATURE.--Vegetables keep best at as low a temperature as possible without freezing. Apples bear a very low temperature. Sweet potatoes (which keep well packed in dry forest leaves), and squashes require a dry, warm atmosphere.</p><p>ALL KINDS OF HERBS.--Gather on a dry day, just before or while in blossom, tie in bundles, blossom downward. When perfectly dry, wrap the medicinal ones in paper, and keep from air. Pick off the leaves of those to be used in cooking, pound, sift them fine, and cork up tightly in bottles.</p><p>KEEPING CABBAGES.--When the weather becomes frosty, cut them off near the head, and carry them, with the leaves on, to a dry cellar, break off superfluous leaves, and pack into a light <implement>cask</implement> or box, stems upward, and when nearly full coverwith loose leaves; secure the box with a lid against rats.</p><p>TO KEEP APPLES.--Apples are usually kept on open shelves, easily accessible, so that the decaying ones may easily be removed. They are sometimes packed in layers of dry sand, care being taken not to let them touch each other, with good results. When they begin to decay, pick out those which are specked, stew them up with cider and sugar, and fill all empty self-sealing fruit-cans, and keep the sauce for use late in the season. Or pack in dry sawdust, or any grain, as oats, barley, etc., so that they will not touch each other; or if fruit is fine, wrap each apple in paper and pack in boxes.</p><pb n="400" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=395"/>

<p>KEEPING CABBAGES IN THE COUNTRY.--Take up the cabbages by the roots, set closely together in rows, up to the head in soil, roots down as they grew; drive in posts at the corners of the bed, and at intermediate points if necessary, higher on one side than the other; nail strips of boards on the posts and lay upon these old boards, doors, or if nothing else is at hand, bean-poles, and corn fodder, high enough so that the roof will be clear of the cabbages, and allow the air to circulate; close up the sides with yard or garden offal of any kind, and the cabbages will keep fresh and green all winter, and be accessible at all times. Exclude moisture but never mind the frost.</p><p>TO KEEP GRAPES.--A barrel hoop suspended from the ceiling by three cords, from which grape stems are hung by means of wire hooks attached to the <emph rend="italic">small</emph> end, sealing the other with hot sealing wax, each stem free from contact with its neighbors, is said to be the best contrivance for keeping grapes. The imperfect grapes must be removed, and the room must be free from frost, and not dry enough to wither them or too moist. The simplest way to keep grapes is to place them in drawers holding about twenty-five pounds each, piling the boxes one over another. Or the drawers may be fitted into racks. A dry cellar, or a room not exposed to frost, is most favorable. The fruit must be mature and perfect. They do not freeze as readily as apples.</p><p>PACKING VEGETABLES.--For present use they should be laid away carefully in a bin with a close lid (hung on hinges) so that the light may be excluded. To keep them for a longer time, the best plan is to pull them on a dry day, cut off the tops and trim, and pack them in clean barrels or boxes, in layers with fine clean moss, such as is found in abundance in woods, between them. The moss keeps them clean and sufficiently moist, preventing shriveling of the roots on the one hand, and absorbing any excess of dampness on the other. When moss can not be conveniently obtained, sand is a good substitute, but is more difficult to handle, and the vegetables do not come out of it so clean and fresh. The varieties which come to maturity late in the season, are easiest to keep and retain their flavor longest.</p></section>

Locke took the ground that the mind of every child born into the world is like a piece of blank paper, that you may write thereon whatever you will; but science proves that such idealists as Descartes were nearer right when they declared that each soul comes freighted with its own ideas, its individual proclivities; that the pre-natal influences do more in the formation of character than all the education that comes after.</p><p>Let the young man, indulging in all manner of excesses, remember that in considering the effect of dissipation, wine, and tobacco, on himself and his own happiness or misery, he does not begin to measure the evil of his life. As the High Priest at the family altar, his deeds of darkness will entail untold suffering on generation after generation. Let the young woman with wasp-like waist, who lives on candies, salads, hot bread, pastry, and pickles, whose listless brain and idle hands seek no profitable occupation, whose life is given to folly, remember that to her ignorance and folly may yet be traced the downfall of a nation.</p><p>One of the most difficult lessons to impress on any mind is the power and extent of individual influence; and parents above all others, resist the belief that their children are exactly what they make them; no more, no less; like producing like. If there is a class of educators who need special preparation for their high and holy calling, it is those who assume the responsibility of parents. Shall we give less thought to the creation of an immortal being than the artist devotes to his statue or landscape? We wander through the art galleries in the old world, and linger before the works of the great masters, transfixed with the grace and beauty, the glory and granduer, of the ideals that surround us; and, with equal preparation, greater than these are possible in living, breathing humanity. The same thought and devotion in real life would soon give us a generation of saints, scholars, scientists, and<pb n="402" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=397"/>statesmen, of glorified humanity; such as the world has not yet seen. To this hour, we have left the greatest event of life to chance, and the result is the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idiot, the lunatic, the epileptic, the criminal, the drunkard, the glutton--thousands of human beings, in our young republic, that never should have been born; a tax on society, a disgrace to their parents, and a curse to themselves.</p><p>Well, born--a child's next right is to intelligent care. If we buy a rare plant, we ask the florist innumerable questions as to its proper training; but the advent of an immortal being seems to suggest no new thought, no anxious investigation into the science of human life. Here we trust every thing to an ignorant nurse, or a neighbor who knows perchance less than we do ourselves.</p><p>Ignorance bandages the new-born child, as tight as a drum, from armpits to hips, compressing every vital organ. There is a tradition that all infants are subject to colic for the first three months of their existence; at the end of which time the bandage is removed, and the colic ceases. Reason suggests that the bandage may be the <emph rend="italic">cause</emph> of the colic, and queries as to the origin of the custom, and its use. She is told, with all seriousness, "that the bones of a new-born child are like cartilage, that, unless they are pinned up snugly, they are in danger of falling to pieces." Reason replies: "If Infinite Wisdom has made kittens and puppies so that their component parts remain together, it is marvelous that He should have left the human being wholly at the mercy of a bandage;" and proposes, with her first-born, to dispense with swaddling bandages, leaving only a slight compress on the navel, for a few days, until perfectly healed.</p><p>Ignorance, believing that every child comes into the world in a diseased and starving condition, begins at once the preparation of a variety of nostrums, chemical and culinary, which she persistently administers to the struggling victim. Reason, knowing that after the fatigue of a long and perilous march, what the young soldier most needs is absolute rest in some warm and cozy tent, shelters him under her wing, and fights off all intruders, sure that when he needs his rations the world will hear from him. His first bath should be preceded by a generous application of pure, sweet olive oil, from head to foot, in every little corner and crevice of his outer man; and then he should be immersed in warm soap-suds, so nearly the temperature of the body as to cause no shock. Great care should be taken that neither oil nor soap touch the eyes. The room should be very warm, all drafts excluded; and on emerging from the tub, a hot soft-flannel blanket should be closely wrapped around him, in which he may rest awhile before dressing. The softest garments, simply made, and so cut as to fasten round the throat and rest on the shoulders, should constitute his wardrobe; eschew all bands, pins, ligatures, ruffles, embroidery, caps, socks, etc.</p><p>Let the child's first efforts at foraging for an existence be at his mother's<pb n="403" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=398"/>
breast; there he will find the medicine he needs, and just what she needs, too, to dispose of.</p><p>The child's mouth and the mother's nipples should be carefully washed before nursing; thus, much suffering, for both mother and child, will be prevented.</p><p>"Give the baby water six times a day," was one of the most important messages ever sent over the telegraph wires to a young mother.</p><p>Ignorance bathes her baby on a full stomach, because she finds it will go through the ordeal of dressing more quietly; Reason bathes hers two hours after feeding, knowing that the vital forces needed for digestion should not be drawn to the surface. Being constructed on the same general plan with its parents, the same principle that makes it dangerous for a man to go swimming immediately after eating, makes it equally so to put a baby in its tub after nursing.</p><p>Though Ignorance eats her own meals regularly and at stated times, she feeds her baby at all times and seasons. If the child has colic from over-eating, or the improper diet of its mother, she tries to allay its suffering with additional feeding and vigorous trotting; not succeeding, she ends the drama with a spoonful of Mrs. Winslow's soothing syrup; having drugged the sentinel and silenced his guns, she imagines the citadel safe. Reason feeds her baby regularly, by the clock, once in two or three hours, and gives the stomach some chance for rest. She prevents colic by regulating her own diet and habits of life, knowing that improper articles of food, and ill-nature or outbursts of passion in the mother, have cost many a baby its life.</p><p>Ignorance, having noticed that her baby sleeps longer with its head covered, uniformily excludes the air. Breathing the same air over a dozen times, it becomes stupefied with the carbonic-acid gas, is thrown into a profuse perspiration, and is sure to catch cold on emerging from the fetid atmosphere. Reason puts her child to sleep, with head uncovered, in a spacious chamber, bright with sunlight and fresh air; where, after a long nap, she will often find him (as soon as he is old enough to notice objects) looking at the shadows on the wall, or studying the anatomical wonders of his own hands and feet, the very picture of content.</p><p>Regular feeding, freedom in dress, plenty of sleep, water, sunlight, and pure air, will secure to babies that health and happiness that in nature should be their inheritance.</p><p>"Seeing that the atmosphere is forty miles deep, all round the globe," says Horace Mann, "it is a useless piece of economy to breathe it more than once. If we were obliged to trundle it in wheel-barrows, in order to fill our homes, churches, school-houses, railroad-cars, and steamboats, there might be some excuse for our seeming parsimony. But as it is we are prodigals of health, of which we have so little; and niggards of air, of which we have so much."<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, New York.</contributor></p></chapter>

Fat beef, bacon, and hearty food may be eaten more freely in winter.</p><p>Let the amount of the meal bear some relation to future needs as well as present appetite; but it is better to carry an extra pound in your pocket than in your stomach.</p><p>Eat something within an hour after rising, especially if obliged to labor or study; but avoid both these before breakfast if possible, and particularly exposure to malaria or contagion.</p><p>Bad cooking may spoil good food. Pork, if eaten at all, should be thoroughly cooked. Avoid frying meat; boil, roast or broil it, beginning with a high heat; for soups begin lukewarm.</p><p>A small quantity of plain, nourishing soup is a wholesome first course at dinner. Rich soups are injurious to persons of weak digestion, and a large quantity of liquid food is not beneficial to adults.</p><p>Three full meals daily are customary, but the number, the relative quantity and quality, and the intervals between them, are largely matters of opinion, habit and convenience; regularity is the important thing.</p><p>Exercise before breakfast should be very light, and it is better to take a cracker or some trifle before going out, especially in a miasmatic climate. Early breakfasts are a necessity to the young and growing.</p><p>Remember that when the stomach is sour after eating, the food is actually rotting--that is a nauseating word but it expresses the absolute facts in the case--and it means that some of the rules above given have been violated.</p><p>Eat in pure air and in pleasant company; light conversation and gentle exercise promote digestion, but hard work of any kind retards it. Avoid severe bodily or mental labor just before and for two hours after a full meal.</p><p>Most people drink too much and too fast. A small quantity of water sipped slowly satisfies thirst as well as a pailful swallowed at a draught.</p><pb n="405" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=400"/><p>Drinks at meals should be taken at the close, and not too strong or hot. Dyspeptics especially should drink sparingly. Children need more than adults, but too much is injurious.</p><p>Adults need to eat at regular intervals two or three times a day, allowing time for each meal to be fully digested before another is taken. It would spoil a loaf of bread, half baked, to poke a lump of cold dough into the middle of it.</p><p>Use good palatable food, not highly seasoned; vary in quantity and quality according to age, climate, weather, and occupation. Unbolted or partially bolted grains are good and sufficient food for men; but nature craves variety. As a rule, the flesh of meat-eating animals is not wholesome food. Hot soft bread digests slowly.</p><p>Don't eat too fast; the digestive organs are something like a stove, which if choked up and out of order, burns slowly, and if you keep piling in fuel, grows more and more choked. The wiser course is to let it burn down and put in fuel only when needed. It is a foolish notion that food always keeps up the strength. Only what we digest helps us; all beyond that is a tax upon the system, and exhausts the strength instead of increasing it.</p><p>Masticate well; five minutes more at dinner may give you better use of an hour afterward. Drink little at meals and never a full glass of very hot or very cold liquid. Never wash down a mouthful. Avoid waste of saliva.</p><p>Avoid tobacco, alcohol in all forms, and all stimulants. Every healthy man is better, stronger, has a clearer head, more endurance, and better chances for a long life, if free from the habitual use of stimulants. The boy who begins the use of tobacco or liquors early is physically ruined.</p><p>Avoid colds and break up as soon as possible when taken. As soon as conscious that the pores are closed, keep warm within doors, drink warm ginger tea, relax the bowels, and take a vapor bath. Breaking a cold up early, often saves a severe attack of congestion, pneumonia, often even a fever.</p><p>Panaceas are <emph rend="italic">prima facie</emph> humbugs; their makers and takers, their vendors and recommenders are knaves or fools, or both. Nature cures most diseases, if let alone or aided by diet and proper care. There are no miracles in medicine; remember that to keep or to get health generally requires only a recognition of Nature's powers, with knowledge of anatomy and physiology, experience, and common sense.</p><p>Never sleep in clothing worn during the day, and let that worn at night be exposed to the air by day. Three pints of moisture, filled with the waste of the body, are given off every twenty-four hours, and mostly absorbed by clothing. Exposure to air and sunlight purifies the clothing and bedding of the poisons which nature is trying to get rid of, and which would otherwise be brought again into contact with the body.</p><p>The lungs should be trained to free, full, and vigorous action. "The breath is the life." A man will exist for days without food, but when the breath is cut off life ceases. If breathing is imperfect, all the functions of<pb n="406" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=401"/>
the body work at a disadvantage. It is a common fault to breathe from the surface of the lungs only, not bringing into play the abdominal muscles, and so not filling the more remote air cells of the lungs. By this defective action the system is deprived of a part of its supply of air, and by inaction the air-cells become diseased.</p><p>Evacuate the bowels daily, and above all regularly; the best time is after breakfast; partly to be rid of a physical burden during the day, but chiefly to relieve the bowels. Constipation is safer than diarrc&#x153;a. For the former, exercise, ride horseback, knead the belly, take a glass of cool water before breakfast, eat fruit and laxative food; for the latter, follow an opposite course--toast, crust, crackers and rice are the best food. Pain and uneasiness of digestive organs are signs of disturbance; keep a clear conscience; rest, sleep, eat properly; avoid strong medicines in ordinary cases.</p><p>Keep the person scrupulously clean; change the clothing worn next to the skin (which should be flannel) often. Don't economize in washing bills. A cold bath every morning for very vigorous persons, or once or twice a week and thorough rubbing with a coarse towel or flesh-brush mornings when bath is not taken, for the less robust, is necessary to keep the functions of the skin in health, and is very invigorating. After warm baths a dash of cold water will prevent chill and "taking cold." In bathing in winter, the shock from cold water is lessened by standing a minute in the cold air after the removal of clothing before applying water.</p><p>A very prolific source of disease is defective drainage. In the country, slops and waste water are thrown into the back yard to trickle back into the well and pollute it, or to form a reeking cesspool which poisons the air. In cities, the sewer-connections with houses allow the foul gases to rush back through the waste-pipes to closets or sinks and into the house. Neatness will cure the first, and a flue connecting each system of drainage-pipes with the tallest chimney in the house where a fire is used, will draw off and consume the gases in the second.</p><p>It should be remembered that the use of chloride of lime, and other fumigants, does not destroy filthiness, but only renders it less evident. Cleanliness, fresh air, and sunlight will purify. Cleanliness is a very strong word. Carpets filled with dust or grease, dirty furniture, or walls covered with old paper, defile the atmosphere as much as a refuse heap in the cellar or back yard. A dark house is generally unwholesome and dirty. The sunlight is second only in importance to fresh air. To convince one that light purifies, it is only necessary to go into a darkened room and note the corrupt smell.</p><p>Ventilation can not be accomplished by simply letting the pure air in; the bad air must be let out. Open a window at top and bottom, hold a lighted candle in the draft, and see the flame turn outward at the top and inward at the bottom, showing the purifying currents. Windows on opposite sides of the room ventilate still more perfectly. In sleeping rooms, avoid "drafts" when possible, but danger of taking cold from them may be averted by extra clothing. In living-rooms, an open fire-place or grate insures<pb n="407" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=402"/>ventilation. The use of close stoves, and close rooms, are the causes of the increased prevalence and fatality, in winter, of small-pox, scarlet fever, and other contagious diseases.</p><p>Colds are often, if not generally, the result of debility, and are preceded by disordered digestion. Such cases are prevented by a removal of the cause by diet and pure air. Extreme cold or heat, and sudden exposure to cold by passing from a heated room to cold outside air, is very injurious to the old or weak. All such should avoid great extremes and sudden changes. In passing from heated assemblies to the cold air, the mouth should be kept closed, and the breathing done through the nostrils only, so that the cold air may be warmed before reaching the lungs, which have just been immersed in a hot-air bath. The injurious effect of such sudden changes is caused by driving the blood from the surface to the internal organs, producing congestions.</p><p>Bad smells mean that decay is going on somewhere. Rotten particles are floating in the air, and penetrating the nostrils and lungs. Their offensiveness means that they are poison and will produce sickness and death, or so reduce the tone of the system that ordinarily mild disorders will prove fatal. In all such cases remove the cause when possible. Many of these poisons are given off by the body, and are removed by pure air as dirt is washed away by water. Soiled or foul air can not purify any more than dirty water will clean dirty clothes. Pure air enters the lungs, becomes charged with waste particles, which are poison if taken back again. An adult spoils <emph rend="italic">one gallon of pure air every minute</emph>, or twenty-five flour barrelfuls in a single night, in breathing alone. A lighted gas-burner consumes eleven gallons, and an ordinary stove twenty-five gallons a minute. Think of these facts before sealing up the fire-place, or nailing down the windows for winter.</p><hd align="center">A DYSPEPTIC'S FIGHT FOR LIFE.</hd><p>Judge W. was a depressed, despondent, discouraged, listless, moody, nervous, wretched dyspeptic for five weary years. He tried travel, but neither the keen air of the sea-shore nor the bracing breezes of the northern prairies brought him relief. He tried all the panaceas and all the doctors at home and abroad in vain. Some told him that he had heart disease, others thought it was inflammation of the spleen, gout, Bright's disease, liver complaint, lung difficulty, or softening of the brain. Bottle after bottle of nostrums went down the unfortunate Judge's throat, and it was only when physicians and friends gave him up, and pronounced him to all intents a dead man, that he threw bottles, plasters, powders and pills to the four winds, and with the energy of despair, set about disappointing his doctors, and getting ready to live despite their ghastly predictions. Then began a fight for life against dyspepsia, a fight which many have begun, but few have won. He bathed the whole body every morning in cold water, summer and winter, not by a <pb n="408" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=403"/>shower or a plunge, but by vigorously dashing the water on the body with the hands, and afterwards rubbing briskly with a coarse towel. This was continued without missing a single morning for years. In the meantime the strictest diet was instituted. By experimenting, the patient found what he could eat without harm, and ate that only in very small quantities, measuring his food on his plate before beginning his meal, and limiting himself rigidly to that quantity. His principal food for nearly three years was cracked wheat and Graham mush, and the last meal was taken at two o'clock in the afternoon--not a particle of food passed his lips from that time until the next morning, thus giving the stomach complete rest and time to begin the work of recuperation. Special attention was given to eating slowly and thoroughly masticating the food, and not to eat too much, too fast, or too often were rules strictly and rigidly observed. Bathing, diet, rest, sleep, and gentle exercise in the open air did the work. It was a dreadful conflict--days of struggle and temptation, requiring more heroism and steady tenacity of purpose than would nerve a soldier for battle, for such a battle is for the day, but this fight was renewed every morning and continued every day for months and years. But patience, courage, intelligent judgment, and a strict adherence to the above regimen won the day without a grain or a drop of medicine, and Judge W. believes that the good Lord of us all has never permitted any man to discover or invent medicine that will cure dyspepsia. Nature is the only perfect physician. Cold water, fresh air, the natural grain (wheat), sleep, rest and gentle exercise make up the grand panacea. With these alone, and the self denial and moral courage to persist in the good fight, the confirmed, nervous, miserable dyspeptic, became a well, strong, and hearty man in five days? No. In five months? No. In five years? Yes; and after the fight, when contemplating the victory won, he could say with the model philanthropist, Amos Lawrence, after his battle of fifteen long years with the same disease, "If men only knew how sweet the victory is, they would not hesitate a moment to engage in the conflict."</p></chapter>

Patients in the sunny wards of hospitals recover soonest, and the sick, in nearly all cases, lie with their faces to the light. Every thing should be kept in perfect neatness and order. Matting is better than a carpet, though when the latter is used it may be kept clean by throwing a few damp tea-leaves over only a part of the room at a time, then quietly brushing them up with a hand broom. A table not liable to injury, a small wicker basket with compartments to hold the different bottles of medicine and a small book in which to write all the physician's directions, two baskets made on the same plan to hold glasses or cups, screens to shade the light from the eyes of the patient, a nursery-lamp with which to heat water, beef-tea, etc., a quill tied on the door-handle, with which the nurse can notify others that the patient is asleep by merely passing the feather-end through the key-hole, several "ring cushions" to give relief to patients compelled to lie continually in one position (these cushions are circular pieces of old linen sewed together and stuffed with bran; or pads may be used, made of cotton-batting basted into pieces of old muslin of any size required), and a sick couch or chair, are a few of the many conveniences which ought to be in every sick-room.</p><p>Pure air in a sick-room is of the utmost importance. In illness, the poisoned body is desperately trying to throw off, through lungs, skin, and in every possible way, the noxious materials that have done the mischief. Bad air, and dirty or saturated bed-clothes, increase the difficulty at the very time when the weakened powers need all the help they can get. Avoid air from kitchen or close closets. Outside air is the best, but, if needed, there should be a fire in the room to take off the chill. A cold is rarely taken in bed, with the bed-clothes well tucked in, but oftener in getting up out of a warm bed when the skin is relaxed. Of course any thing like a "chill" should be avoided, and it is not well to allow a draft or current of air to pass directly over the bed of the patient.</p><p>In disease less heat is produced by the body than in health. This decline occurs even in summer, and is usually most evident in the early morning, when the vital powers slacken, the food of the previous day having been exhausted. The sick should be watched between midnight and ten or eleven in the morning, and if any decline in heat is noticed, it should be supplied by jugs of hot water. A sick-room, should above all be quiet. Any rustling sound, such as that of a silk dress or shoes which creak, should be entirely avoided. If it is necessary to put coal on the fire, drop it on quietly<pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=405"/>in small paper sacks, or rolled in paper slightly dampened. Visitors should never be admitted to a sick-room. The necessary attendants are usually a sufficient annoyance to a weak patient, and many a tombstone might truthfully and appropriately be inscribed "talked to death by well-meaning friends." It is not generally the loudness of a noise that disturbs the sick, but the sound the produces expectation of something to happen. Some can not bear any noise. Any thing that suddenly awakens is injurious. Never awaken a sleeping patient unless ordered to do so by the physician. In sickness, the brain is weakened with the rest of the body, and sleep strengthens it. If rest is interrupted soon after it is begun, the brain is weakened so much the more, and the patient becomes irritable and wakeful. If sleep lasts longer, he falls asleep again more readily. Never speak within the hearing of the sick, in tones which can not be fully understood. An occasional word, or murmur of conversation, or whisper, is intolerable, and occasions needless apprehension.</p><p>Few persons have any idea of the exquisite neatness necessary in a sick-room. What a well person might endure with impunity, may prove fatal to a weak patient. Especially the bed and bedding should be scrupulously clean. In most diseases the functions of the skin are disordered, and the clothing becomes saturated with foul perspiration, so that the patient alternates between a cold damp after the bed is made, and a warm damp before, both poison to his system. Sheets which are used should be dried often from this poisonous damp, either in the sun or by the fire, and the mattress and blanket next the sheets, should also be carefully aired as often as possible. In changing very sick patients (particularly women after confinement) the sheets and wearing-clothes should be well aired by hanging by the fire for two days, or smoked by holding them over hot coals sprinkled with bran. Move the patient close to one side of the bed, turn the under sheet over close to the invalid, then smooth the mattress, removing any thing that may be on it. Make ready the clean sheet, by rolling one half into a round roll, lay this close by the invalid, spread the other half smoothly over the bed. Now assist the patient on the clean sheet, unroll, and spread over the other side of the bed. Have the upper sheet ready, which must be carefully and gently laid over the invalid, then add the other bed-clothes. (In dressing a blister where a bandage has to be placed around the body, roll one half the bandage, place it under the invalid, so that the attendant at the other side can reach it, unrolling, and placing it around the patient without disturbing him.) Light blankets are best for coverings. Never use the impervious cotton counterpanes and comforters. The clothing should be as light as possible with the requisite warmth. The bed should be low, and placed in the light, and as a rule the pillows should be low, so as to give the lungs free play. Scrofula is sometimes caused by children sleeping with their heads under the clothing, and patients sometimes acquire the same injurious habit.</p><pb n="411" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=406"/><p>Bathing should always be done under the advice of a physician, but soap and water are great restoratives. In most cases, washing and properly drying the skin gives great relief. Care should be taken, while sponging and cleansing, not to expose too great a surface at a time, so as to check perspiration. The physician will regulate the temperature. Sometimes a little vinegar, whisky, or alcohol added to the water, makes the bath more refreshing, and bay-rum for the face, neck, and hands is often acceptable. Whenever the bath is followed by a sense of oppression, it has done harm. Its effect should be comfort and relief.</p><p>Chamber utensils should be emptied and thoroughly cleansed immediately after using, and in no case allowed to remain standing in the sick-room. Slop-pails, into which nothing should be allowed to go except the waste water from the wash-stand, must be emptied and cleansed thoroughly at least twice a day.</p><p>Patients are often killed by kindness. A spoonful of improper food, or the indulgence of some whim, may prove fatal. A physician's directions should always be observed with the strictest fidelity. Medicines and things which will be wanted during the night should all be prepared before the patient grows sleepy. Every thing should be done quickly but quietly, and with precision. In talking, sit where the patient can see you without turning his head. Never ask questions when he is doing any thing, and never lean or sit upon the bed. Sick persons generally prefer to be told any thing rather than to have it read to them. A change in the ornaments of the room is a great relief, and the sick especially enjoy bright and beautiful things. Flowers which do not have a pungent odor are always a great delight.</p><p>In convalescence great care is necessary, and the physician's directions should be implicitly obeyed, especially in regard to diet; a failure in obedience often brings on a fatal relapse. A little food at a time and often repeated, is the general rule for the sick. A table-spoonful of beef-tea, every half hour, will be digested, when a cupful every three or four hours will be rejected. (In giving a drink or liquid of any kind a moustache-cup will be found a great convenience). The sick can rarely take solid food before eleven in the morning, and a spoonful of beef-tea, or whatever stimulant the physician has ordered, given every hour or two, relieves exhaustion. Brandy, whisky, or other alcoholic stimulants, however, should never be ordered in cases where there is a hereditary tendency to use them, or where they have been used as a beverage, or where the associations of the patient in the future would be likely to make an acquired taste for them a temptation. In most cases substitutes may readily be found. Untouched food should never be left at the bed-side. Every meal should be a surprise, and the patient should be left alone while eating. Food for the sick must be of the best quality, and neatly and delicately prepared. The cook should do half the<pb n="412" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=407"/>
patient's digesting. Keep the cup and saucer dry, so that no drops will fall on the bed or clothing.</p><p>Beef-tea contains a certain amount of nourishment, and may be given in almost any inflammatory disease. Eggs do not agree with all patients, but are nourishing food when admissable. Tenderloin of beef, cut across the grain, and broiled on live coals, without smoke, and well cooked or rare as the physician may direct, is always relished, and a tender lamb-chop, broiled in the same way with the fat removed before serving, is easily digested and nutritious Roasted potatoes, very mealy, are preferred to other vegetables. Milk is a representative diet, and when it agrees with the digestion, is probably better adapted to strengthen the body in sickness than any other one article of food, but it must be fresh and pure. The least taint of sourness is injurious. Butter-milk, however, when fresh, is useful in fevers, bilious diseases, and dyspepsia. Cream is even better than milk, and is less apt to turn acid in the stomach. Many patients thrive on Indian-meal mush and cream, and any preparation of Indian-meal are especially good for persons who are suffering from the loss of natural warmth (see Bread-making). Oatmeal, Graham and rye mush, and home-made brown bread are important articles of diet, greatly relished by the sick. There are instances of persons recovering from serious illness where a table-spoonful of rye mush, and half tea-cupful buttermilk, three times a day, were all that could be taken for two or three weeks. A patient's craving for any particular article of food should be communicated to the physician as it is often a valuable indication of the wants of the system. These cravings should be gratified whenever possible. Watermelons act on the kidneys, and are good in many cases of fever, bowel complaint, etc. Celery also is good in some diseases of the kidneys, and in nervousness. Fresh, crisp, raw cabbage, sliced fine and eaten with good vinegar, is easily digested, and often highly relished by a patient suffering from a "weak stomach." New cider is also excellent in many cases of nervous dyspepsia. Fruits and berries, raw, ripe, and perfect, used in moderation, are admirable remedies in cases of constipation and its attendant diseases. The grape has a wide range of curative qualities. The seeds are excellent for costiveness, the pulp is very nutritious and soothing to irritated bowels, while the skins, if chewed, act as an astringent. Raw beef is excellent in dysentery; it should be minced very fine, and given in doses of a spoonful at a time every four hours, the patient in the meantime eating nothing else. Bananas, or baked apples are good in chronic diarrh&#x153;a. A rind of bacon is good for teething children to chew. Rice-water or rice-jelly are advisable in many cases of convalescence from acute fever, summer complaint, and like diseases. Fresh pop-corn, nicely salted, clam-broth, the juice of a roasted oyster in the shell, soda-water, and peppermint-tea are remedies for sick stomach. Vegetable acid drinks, herb-teas, toast-water, and all such drinks are often much relished. A custard made from a preparation<pb n="413" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=408"/>of liquid rennet, as directed on bottle, is a delicate dish. Buttered-toast, either dry or dipped, though so generally given, is rarely a suitable article for the sick, as melted oils are very difficult of digestion. In quinsy, diphtheria, inflammation of lungs, typhus and other putrid fevers, acids are of very great benefit. Take a handful of dried currants, pour over them a pint of boiling water, let them stand half a minute without stirring, then drain off the water, strain it through a cloth, and set it away to cool; when given to the patient, dilute well so that the acid taste is very slight. Acid fruits should be eaten early in the day. Above all, it should be remembered that it is not the nourishment which food contains, but <emph rend="italic">that which the stomach can assimilate</emph>, that builds up; a sick person will thrive on what would not sustain a well man.</p><p>It is of the utmost importance that the food be delicately and carefully administered, and this should never be left to servants. It should be made as attractive as possible, served in the choicest ware, with the cleanest of napkins, and the brightest of silver. If tea is served, it should be freshly drawn, in a dainty cup, with a block of white sugar, and a few drops of sweet cream. Toast should be thin, symmetrical, well yellowed, free from crust, and just from the fire. Steak should be a cut of the best tenderloin, delicately broiled, and served with the nicest of roasted potatoes. The attention given to these simple matters is in many cases worth more than the physician's prescriptions.</p><p>The craving for tea and coffee is almost universal with the sick. A moderate quantity is a great restorative, but an excess, especially of coffee, impairs digestion. Neither should be given after five in the afternoon, as they increase excitement, and cause sleeplessness; but sleeplessness from exhaustion in the early morning is often relieved by a cup of tea or coffee. The patient's taste will decide which should be used. In cases of thirst, the physician will prescribe what other drink should be given to satisfy it. Cocoa is not often craved by the sick, and possesses no stimulating qualities. Crust-coffee is very nourishing.</p>

<p>There is a French legend connected with this preparation (called <emph rend="italic">vinaigre a quatre voleurs</emph>). During the plague at Marseilles, a band of robbers plundered the dying and the dead without injury to themselves.

<chapter class1="medhealth"><pb n="419" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=414"/><hd align="center" size="larger">THE ARTS OF THE TOILET.</hd><p>Beauty and health constitute a royal inheritance. The child born with such a heritage, and brought up by a mother who has the good sense to discard soothing syrups, narcotics and cordials, and carefully trains up to cleanly habits, proper exercise, plenty of air and sunshine, and wholesome food, starts in life with a capital that will in the long run tip the balance against the largest fortune in dollars. To keep health and beauty, or to restore it when lost, it is necessary to observe the laws of health, discarding quackery and panaceas of all kinds as superstitions, and inventions of the devil. Pure air and plenty of it, free sunshine and plenty of it, are better restoratives than all the patent medicines under the sun. Too often the doctor brings the medicine only to have the medicine bring the doctor again. The sun-light will give a lady's cheek a fresher tinge and a more delicate complexion than all the French powders and rouge in Paris.</p><p>THE BATH--Not only promotes cleanliness, but is a tonic. The skin does one third of the work of breathing, and if the myriad of pores are closed, the lungs are overburdened, or else the work is left undone. The tonic effect is caused by the contraction of the surface blood-vessels, driving the blood back to the larger blood-vessels and the heart, bringing on a reaction which rushes the blood back to the skin, causing a glow, freer respiration, and more vigorous action of the whole muscular system. A sponge or hand bath are the simplest forms, and should be taken in a moderately warm room. As a rule, the more rapidly a bath is taken the better, and it should always be followed by friction with the hand or with a not too rough towel.</p><p>THE FACE.--To wash properly, fill basin two-thirds full with fresh, soft water, dip face in the water and then the hands; soap the hands well and rub with a gentle friction over the face; dip the face in water the second time and rinse off thoroughly, wiping with a thick but soft towel. Pure soaps do not irritate the skin. The best are castile, curd, glycerine and other neutral soaps. Medicated or highly colored or perfumed soaps should never be used.</p><p>FOOD.--A good complexion never goes with a bad diet. Strong coffee, hot bread and butter, heated grease, highly spiced soups, meats, or game, hot drinks, alcoholic liquors, fat meats, are all damaging to its beauty. Strong tea, used daily, will after a time give the skin the color and appearance of leather. Coffee affects the skin less but the nerves more, and a healthy nervous system is necessary to beauty. Late suppers, over-eating at meals, eating between meals, the use of candies, sweetmeats, preserves, etc., produce pimples and blotches.</p><p>CORPULENCY.--An excess of fat is a disease. To reduce the excess, eat<pb n="420" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=415"/>little or no butter, fat meat, gravies, sugar, vegetables, or other articles containing large amounts of starch or sugar.</p><p>LEANNESS--Is caused generally by lack of power in the digestive organs to digest and assimilate the fat-producing elements of food. First restore digestion, take plenty of sleep, drink all the water the stomach will bear in the morning on rising, take moderate exercise in the open air, eat oat-meal, cracked wheat, Graham mush, baked sweet apples, roasted and broiled beef, cultivate jolly people, and bathe daily.</p><p>DRESS.--The first object of dress is protection of the body, second to enhance and bring out its beauty. Dress which does not enhance the beauty of the wearer, or which attracts attention from the wearer to itself, is out of taste. To be in correct taste it must be "becoming," and in this sense dressing is an art worthy of the attention and study of the most intellectual and accomplished woman. The beauty of dress, to a cultivated eye, does not lie in its money-value, but in its perfection in detail and perfect adaptation to the wearer and the occasion for which it is intended. Any simpleton in petticoats, who has plenty of money, can order her clothes from Worth, in the latest Paris styles, but some quiet woman, with brains and taste, in simpler costume, will be sure to outshine her in "society." Low-necked dresses, dragging skirts, corsets and stays, paddings, heavy skirts which rest on the hips, heavy veils, high-heeled boots, and every other unphysiological abomination in dress, mars beauty and destroys health.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>THE HAIR.--combs of tortoise-shell, bone, or rubber, with not very sharp teeth, should be used. Sharp teeth injure the scalp and produce dandruff. Two brushes, one hard, to clean the hair and scalp, and the other soft, to smooth and polish, are best. <variation><purpose>Clean brushes</purpose> by rubbing them with <ingredient>bran,</ingredient> or wash with one part <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> and two of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></variation> Combing or brushing should be done in the natural direction of the hair, and never against it. In the proper way it can not be brushed too much. <variation><purpose>To keep the scalp clean</purpose> wash in <ingredient>tepid soft water</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>pure soap</ingredient> in it, rinse in <ingredient>pure water,</ingredient> dry with towels and then in the sun or by the fire. Oily hair may be washed once a week, light hair less often. Some occupations require that it should be washed much oftener.</variation> All preparations for the hair are more or less injurious. Healthy hair has enough oil of its own, and the application of foreign oil destroys its vitality. Preparations containing alcohol fade hair and make it brittle. <variation>The only time when <purpose>oil</purpose> is admissable is after washing. The best preparation is one part of <ingredient>glycerine</ingredient> to three of <ingredient>rose-water.</ingredient></variation> Powders made of starch, when used, must be washed out of the hair to prevent injury. Those made of colored glass are very injurious, cutting and otherwise damaging the hair. At night, the hair should be loosened and left free. Night-caps are a relic of barbarism, Hair-dyes are very injurious, as they all contain more or less sugar of lead, nitrate of silver, and other ingredients, which affect the brain, produce paralysis, inflammation of the eyes, and impairment of sight. Gray hairs are an indication that the hair-producing organs are weakening. When found they should be cut down to the healthy part, and the head should be exposed as much as possible, except in the middle of the day, to the sun and air. <variation>When 
<purpose>hair falls out,</purpose>
it indicates a disease of the scalp. To cure, dip the head twice a day in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and rub with a brush until a glow is produced. In case the hair is too long to wet, brush until a glow is produced, and then rub into the roots a wash made of three drachms of <ingredient><emph rend="italic">pure</emph> glycerine</ingredient> and four ounces of <ingredient>lime-water.</ingredient> After the use of this for two or three weeks, add half an ounce of the <ingredient>tincture of cantharides</ingredient> to the above mixture. Use this treatment once or twice a day; if tender, diminishing the application, if insensible, increasing it.</variation> If baldness<pb n="421" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=416"/>
comes in spots, the skin should be brushed with a soft tooth-brush dipped in <ingredient>distilled vinegar,</ingredient> at morning and evening, and then brushed as above.</p></formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>
<purpose>SUPERFLUOUS HAIRS</purpose>
--Are best left alone. Shaving only increases the strength of the hair, and all depilatories are dangerous and sometimes disfigure the face. The only sure plan is to spread on a piece of leather equal parts of <ingredient>galbanum</ingredient> and <ingredient>pitch plaster,</ingredient> lay it on the hairs as smoothly as possible, let it remain three or four minutes, then remove it with the hairs, root and branch. This is severe, but effective. <variation><ingredient>Kerosene</ingredient> will also remove them.</variation> If sore after using, rub on <ingredient>sweet oil.</ingredient></p></formula>
<p>THE SKIN AND COMPLEXION.--Washing in cool, but not excessively cold, water, and general cleanliness, keeps the skin healthy and complexion clear.</p><p>LIPS OR HANDS CHAPPED by cold weather or wind, should be rubbed with glycerine gently when about to be exposed to the air, or rubbed with honey after washing. Never kiss the lips of persons not in health, as disease is sometimes contracted in this way, as well as by the use of towels, cups or <implement>tumblers</implement> used by unhealthy persons.</p><p>TEETH.--Cracking nuts, biting thread, eating hot food, especially bread and pastry raised with soda, very cold drinks, alternate contact with cold and hot substances, highly seasoned food, alcoholic liquors and tobacco, metal toothpicks, and want of cleanliness, are injurious to teeth. After eating, the mouth should be rinsed with lukewarm water, and such pieces of food as are not thus washed away, removed by a quill toothpick. Tooth-brushes should be elastic and moderately hard. Those with hairs not too close together are best and most durable. A brush that is too hard may be permanently softened by dipping in hot water. Rub up and down as well as across the teeth. Teeth should be often examined by a competent dentist.</p><p>THE BREATH.--Nothing makes one so disagreeable to others as a bad breath. It is caused by bad teeth, diseased stomach, or disease of the nostrils. Neatness and care of the health will prevent and cure it.</p><p>THE EYES.--Damp, foggy weather, the reflection of the bright sunshine, intense cold, dusty wind, reading on cars in motion, reading by gas or lamp-light when the light falls directly on the eyes, sitting before a glowing fire, wearing of glasses when not needed, wearing veils, and all indulgences that weaken the nervous system, injure the eyes. The most pleasing light for work is from a northern exposure. A shade that protects the eyes from the light that falls on paper, book or work is an advantage. The light should not come from different points, but that from behind the worker is best. A very weak or very bright light should be equally avoided. Diseases of the eye are often the result of general weakness, and in such cases local treatment has little effect. In fitting glasses to the eye great care should be taken to adjust the lens to the eye with accuracy. Crown glass is preferable to flint on account of its superior hardness, its entire want of color, and its non-decomposition of light. Scotch pebbles are unobjectionable except as to cost.</p><p>THE EAR.--The outer ear should be well-cleansed and the passage wiped out daily with a rag on the end of the little finger, but nothing should be inserted further. The insertion of a pin, or any hard substance, frequently ruptures the ear. When cleansing is necessary on account of accumulation of wax by cold, or other cause, it should be done by syringing with warm water, having dropped in two or three drops of glycerine the night before to soften the substance to be removed. This often cures sudden deafness. Cotton-wool stuffed into the ear is injurious and is seldom necessary. In conversing with deaf persons, it is important to remember that clearness, distinctness,<pb n="422" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=417"/>and a musical tone of voice is understood much more easily a loud tone.</p>
<ednote>Page 422 needs to be checked against the orinigal text since the righthand ends of the sentences were accidently cut off when scanned.</ednote><p>THE NOSE.--Excessive wiping, snuffing, and blowing, especially in children, deforms the nose, and should be practiced only when necessary for cleanliness. A nose leaning to one side, caused by wiping in one direction may be cured by using the handkerchief with the other hand, or by wearing occasionally an instrument surgeons employ for that purpose. Large, fat noses are reduced by wearing at night a contrivance which compresses the artery that supplies the nose. Red noses become so by exposure to heat of the sun, by alcoholic drinks, or by a debility of the blood-vessels of the nose. The latter cause is removed by gentle friction and cold bathing of the nose.</p><p>THE NECK.--Too tight collars and neckerchiefs are apt to produce permanent swelling of the throat.</p><p>THE HANDS.--The use of gloves, especially kids, help to preserve the cleanliness of the hands. Cleanliness and sprinkling with orris-root counteract excessive perspiration. Warts are removed by steeping the hands in warm water for half an hour, and then paring away the white and insensible outer face. The nails should be cut frequently, always in oval shape. The nail brush should be full and soft. It should be rubbed on a cake of soap and then used vigorously. Biting nails is a bad habit. To break it up in children, dip the ends of the fingers in a solution of aloes.</p><p>THE FEET.--The largest pores of the body are located in the bottom of the feet. For this reason the feet should be frequently and thoroughly washed, and the stockings changed often. If great cleanliness is not observed, these great pores become absorbent, and the poisons given off are taken back into the system. The nails ought to be cut squarely. Blistering may be prevented by rubbing the feet, after washing, with glycerine. Bunions are caused by wearing shoes too tight or too short. They are difficult to get rid of, but may be alleviated by wearing easy-fitting shoes, poultices and putting a rubber ring around the spot. Corns, which are caused by continued pressure on the foot, may be prevented by wearing woolen stockings and shoes that fit well. To cure, soak feet for half an hour, night and day in hot water in which two table-spoons of soda have been dissolved. After each bath scrape as much away as possible. Soft corns may be removed by sprinkling a piece of cotton with prepared chalk, and placing it between the toes where the corn is. The chalk absorbs the moisture and a cure is thereby effected.</p><p>FRECKLES.--Grate horse-radish fine; let it stand a few hours in butter and then strain and use the wash night and morning. Or squeeze the juice of one lemon into half a goblet of water and use the same way. Most of the remedies for freckles are poisonous, and can not be used with safety. Freckles indicate a defective digestion, and consist in deposits of some carbonaeous or fatty matter beneath the skin. The diet should be of a nature that bowls and kidneys will do their duty. Daily bathing, with much friction, should not be neglected, and the Turkish bath taken occasionally, if convenient.</p><p>PIMPLES.--Are caused by improper diet, and can never be cured except by correcting the habits. Cosmetics only injure.</p> <p>MOLES.--To remove, moisten a stick of nitrate of silver, touch the mole and they will turn black and sore, and soon they will dry up and fall off by themselves. If they do not entirely go, repeat. It is better, however, not to attempt their removal without consulting a physician.</p><p>MOTHER'S MARKS--Should never be interfered with except by the approval of a physician.</p><p>WARTS.--Wash with water saturated with common washing soda, allow to<pb n="423" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=418"/>dry without wiping; repeat frequently until they disappear. Or pass a pin through the wart and hold one end of it over the flame of a candle or lamp until the wart fires by the heat, and it will disappear.</p> <p>TETTER OR RINGWORM of the face is caused by a disordered stomach, and must be cured by proper diet.</p><p>FLESH WORMS.--Black specks on the nose disfigure the face. Remove by washing thoroughly in tepid water, rubbing with a towel, and applying with a soft flannel a lotion made of three ounces of cologne and half an ounce of liquor of potash.</p><p>STAINS ON THE HANDS--From nitrate of silver may be removed by a solution of chloride of lime. Fruit-stains are removed by washing the hands without soap, and holding them over the smoke of burning matches or sulphur.</p>

<p>TEETH.--Many, while attentive to their teeth, do more injury than good by too much officiousness, daily applying some dentifrice, or tooth-powder, often impure and injurious, and rubbing them so <ingredient>hard</ingredient> as not only to injure the enamel by excessive friction, but also to hurt the gums even more than by a toothpicks.

<p>CUTTING TEETH.--The time the first teeth make their appearance varies, but the following dates approximate the time: Central incisors from five to eight months after birth; lateral incisors from seven to ten; first molars from twelve to sixteen; cuspids, or eye-teeth, from fourteen to twenty; second molars from twenty to thirty-six. The first teeth should be protected from decay as far as possible by careful cleaning daily; if decay makes its appearance, the cavity should be promptly filled, and the tooth saved until displaced by the permanent teeth. About the sixth year the first molars of the permanent teeth made their appearance. They are generally supposed to belong to the first or milk teeth and are frequently lost for want of care. A little more attention given to the first teeth would save parents and children sleepless nights and suffering.<contributor rend="italic">--B. L. Taylor, D.D.S., Minneapolis.</contributor></p>

<chapter class1="medhealth"><pb n="425" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=420"/><hd align="center" size="larger">ACCIDENTS AND SUDDEN SICKNESS.</hd><p>It is no longer considered a mark of the highest type of the feminine mind to faint away at the smallest fright, and to sink into helplessness at the first appearance of danger. Indeed, self-possession in emergencies is evidence of a clear brain, which, at the critical moment, asserts its supremacy over physical weakness, and takes command of the demoralized forces; besides, fright and confusion are a confession of ignorance as well as want of self-control. Those who know exactly what to do in emergencies rarely become panic-stricken. And it is particularly important for women, who are, doubtless, constitutionally more timid than men, to fortify themselves against danger, by learning what to do in such accidents and emergencies as are likely to occur in the life of every one. It would prove a rare case, indeed, if such knowledge did not, at least once in a life-time, enable the possessor of it to save a valuable life, perhaps one infinitely dearer to her than her own. Of course, within the limits of such an article as is permissible here, only a few hints can be given, rather to suggest further investigation than to be a complete guide.</p><p>ACCIDENTS IN GENERAL.--The first and most important thing, after sending for a surgeon, when an accident has occurred, is to keep off the crowd. No one, except one or two in charge, should be allowed nearer than ten feet; and the kindest thing a by-stander can do is to insist on such a space, and to select such persons as are willing to go for whatever is needed by the surgeon or physician, so that there may be no delay, if any thing is needed. If there has been a "shock" from a fall or blow, although there may be no fracture or external injury, the person is "faint," and should be placed flat on the back, with the head, neck, and shoulders <emph rend="italic">slightly</emph> raised; the limbs should be straightened out, so that the heart may act as easily as possible; the cravat, collar, and clothing, if in the least tight, should be loosened. A sup of cold water will bring reaction soon if the injury is slight; a tea-spoonful of brandy, in a table-spoonful of water, every two minutes, gentle friction to the extremities, a handkerchief wet with cologne-water held to the nostrils, a fan, if weather is hot, will all aid in restoring full consciousness. If thought best to remove the patient to his residence, or to a more favorable place for treatment, place on a stretcher, settee, or shutter, slipping him on gently, taking care that the body is supported along its whole length; throw a handkerchief over the face to prevent the unpleasant sensation of the staring crowd, and let the stretcher be borne by persons of uniform gait, if possible. A policeman's services, if in a city, are invaluable in keeping off a crowd. When a surgeon arrives, his directions will suffice.</p><p>DROWNING.--Death is caused by cutting off the supply of fresh air from the lungs, so that the process of purification of the arterial blood ceases. Life is rarely restored after an immersion of five or six minutes, but recovery has been recorded after twenty minutes. Efforts to restore should be continued for at least two hours, or until the arrival of a physician. What is<pb n="426" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=421"/>
<ednote>Page 426 needs to be checked against the orinigal text since the righthand ends of the sentences were accidently cut off when scanned.</ednote>done must be done quickly. The body should be recovered, without loss of time, from the water, and laid face downward for a moment, while the tongue is pressed back by the finger to allow the escape of water or any other substance from the mouth or throat (no water can ever by any possibility get into the lungs). This may be done while the body is being conveyed to the nearest house; on arrival, strip off clothing, place on a warm bed, with head raised very little, if any, apply friction with the dry hands to the extremities and heated flannels to the rest of the body. Now breathing must be artificially restored. "Silvester's ready method" is most favored by physicians and consists in pulling the tongue well forward, to favor the passage of air to the lungs, and then drawing the arms away from the sides of the body, and upward, so that they meet over the head, and then bringing them down until the elbows almost meet over the "pit of the stomach." These movements must be made, and persisted in, at the rate of sixteen to the minute. Another method is to place the body flat on the face, press gently on the back, turn body on its side or a little beyond, and then, turning back upon face, apply gentle pressure again, repeating at the rate of sixteen times per minute. As soon as vitality begins to return a few drops of brandy, in a little water, may be administered, and, in a few minutes, some beef-tea or light nourishment. Persons at all weakened by debility, especially by anything that affects the nervous system, or those recovering from sickness, are in the least indisposed, should never venture into water beyond their depth as such conditions predispose to "cramp," against which the best swimmers are helpless.</p><p>HANGING.--Death is from the same cause as in drowning. Cut down the body without allowing it to fall, place on face, press back tongue with finger to allow any accumulation to escape from the mouth, place on the back, and treat as directed for the drowned. If body is still warm after the removal of clothing, stand off six feet and dash several times with a bowl of cold water, the face, neck, and chest.</p><p>SUFFOCATION.--This often occurs from carbonic-acid gas, or "choke-damp" on entering wells or old cellars; this gas being heavier than air falls and rests at the bottom. Before entering such places, test by lowering a lighted candle; if the flame is extinguished it is unsafe to enter until the gas has been removed by throwing down a bundle of lighted shavings or blazing paper, sufficient to cause a strong upward current. When a person is over come by this gas, he must be <emph rend="italic">immediately</emph> rescued by another, who must be rapidly lowered and drawn out, as he must do all while holding his breath a large sack is sometimes thrown over the person who goes to the rescue. As soon as brought out, place the person on his back, bare the neck and throat, loosen clothing, and strip as quickly as possible; if he has not fallen in the water, dash cold water freely over head, neck, and shoulders, standing off several feet and throwing it with force; artificial respiration should be used meantime, as in case of drowning, with as little cessation as possible. If the person has fallen into the water when overcome by the gas, place in a warm bed, and use the means of artificial respiration vigorously.</p><p>Suffocation from burning charcoal, from anthracite or bituminous coal, or from common burning gas, or the foul gases from drains and cess-pools, is treated as if from carbonic acid gas.</p> <p>CHOKING.--A piece of food lodged in the throat may sometimes be pushed down with the finger, or removed with a hair-pin quickly straightened and hooked at the end, or by two or three vigorous blows on the back between the shoulders.</p><p>SUNSTROKE.--This is favored by intemperance, and by debility brought<pb n="427" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=422"/>
on by work in a heated atmosphere. Those who sleep in badly ventilated apartments are most subject to it. Most cases are preceded by pain the head, wandering thought and loss of mental control, disturbed vision, irritability, sense of pain, and weight at pit of stomach, and labored breathing. The skin is hot and dry, or covered with profuse perspiration; the face bluish; the breath rapid and short; and the action of the heart "fluttering." In many instances the patient does not move an eyelid, from the beginning of the main attack until death ensues.</p><p>Carry the person attacked at once to a cool, airy spot, in the shadow of a wall, or to a large room with a bare floor, remove clothing gently, place patient on the back, raise head two inches by a folded garment, dash entire body with water profusely, supplying basin with cold water from two buckets, one of which is filled with water and finely pulverized ice while the other is supplying the water used by the attendant. Dash on water with force, particularly on head and chest. Two persons may also rub the entire body, particularly the head, with a towel in which is wrapped pulverized ice. As soon as a <emph rend="italic">decline in heat</emph> is noticed remove patient to a dry place, and wipe dry. If heat comes on again when consciousness is restored, renew cold applications. As soon as the heat declines, artificial respiration must be resorted to, until the natural takes its place. There being real asphyxia, as in drowning, no medicine is of use, and alcoholic stimulants should be carefully avoided. To prevent sunstroke, use no malt or alcoholic liquors, avoid overwork and exhaustion, take plenty of sleep in a well-ventilated room, bathe every night, avoid drinking large quantities of water, especially at meals, wear loose-fitting garments, protect the head with a covering that will shelter from the sun and yet permit free circulation of air over the scalp; a straw hat of loose texture, with a lining that may be wet when going out, and a broad brim to protect neck and shoulders, is best.</p><p>LIGHTNING.--If the person shows no signs of life, strip and dash the body with cold water, dry and place in bed with bottles of hot water at the pit of the stomach and extremities, keeping up artificial respiration until the natural breathing is restored; a tea-spoonful of brandy in a table-spoonful of water, may be given every few minutes. Burns from lightning should be treated like burns from any other cause.</p><p>SHOCK OR COLLAPSE from lightning, sudden and severe injuries, burns extending over a large extent of surface, or powerful emotions, produces something analogous to fainting. Place the patient flat on the back, with the head raised not more than an inch, and give a tea-spoonful of brandy in a table-spoonful of water, every minute for six or eight minutes. If the temperature of the body has been raised, and the action of the heart is restored, enough has been given. Application of heat to the stomach and extremities is useful. The nausea and vomiting that sometimes accompany it may be allayed by swallowing whole small chips of ice, split off by standing a piece with grain upright and splitting off a thin edge with the point of a pin. Ammonia applied to the nostrils is often useful, and cologne on a handkerchief is sometimes of service.</p><p>FAINTING.--Debility of the nervous system favors fainting. The head should be kept low; and if the patient faints in a chair, the simplest treatment is to grasp the back of it and depress it until the floor is reached, while another holds the knees so as to prevent slipping off the side. The patient will usually recover by the time the head has reached the floor.</p><p>SHOCK FROM COLD WATER.--Prostration from drinking or bathing in cold water while exhausted by heat or exercise should be treated as described for shock from other causes. Cold water should be taken in small quantities<pb n="428" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=423"/>when the body is heated and exhausted, and a cold bath is often fatal under such circumstances.</p><p>BURNS AND SCALDS.--First put the fire out. If the clothing is on fire, throw the person on the ground and wrap in carpet, rug, or your coat, if nothing else is at hand. Begin wrapping at the neck and shoulders, and keep the flames away from the neck and face, so as to prevent breathing the hot air and consequent injury to the lungs. If prostration and shock or fainting is produced, a little brandy, repeated often until there is a revival of strength, should be given. A superficial burn covering a large surface is often more dangerous than a deeper one confined to less surface. If there is any cause for apprehension that the hot air has been inhaled, send for a physician at once. If the burn is slight in character, apply the water-dressing, by placing two or more thicknesses of old linen (from table-cloth or sheet), slightly dampened over a surface a little larger than the wound; fasten on by slips of <implement>sticking-plaster,</implement> or tie on with bandages, and keep it wet by frequent applications of water. When the pain has moderated a dressing of <emph rend="italic">pure</emph> hog's-lard is one of the best. It may be purified, when doubtful, by boiling in water until the salt and impurities have settled, and then set away to cool until the floating lard hardens; this is gathered, placed in a bowl, set in hot water, and kept hot until all the water in the lard has passed off, when it is ready for use. A good dressing for a slight burn or scald is the white of an egg, applied with a soft rag or brush, applying fresh as the first layer dries; a lather of soap from a shaving-cup often allays pain, and keeps out the air. If so serious that a physician has been sent for, it is better not to apply any thing, as it may interfere with his examination and treatment of the case. In cases too severe for the mild treatment given above, send at once for a physician.</p><p>BURNS BY ALKALIES.--Such as lime, caustic potash, soda, ammonia, etc., are stopped in their progress by applying vinegar, lemon-juice, or other dilute acid; they must be then treated like other burns.</p><p>BURNS FROM ACIDS.--Such as oil of vitriol and aqua fortis may be checked by the free application of water or handfuls of moist earth. The first dilutes the acid, and the second contains alkali enough to neutralize the acid.</p><p>FRACTURE.--Send at once for a physician, and simply make the patient as comfortable as possible. If he is to be conveyed to some distance, the fractured part should be supported in its natural position by handkerchiefs loosely tied. Allow no more handling than is absolutely necessary.</p><p>WOUNDS.--If an artery has been severed, and the blood spurts out at each heart-beat, press on the point of division firmly with the finger, to diminish the size of the blood-vessel, until a clot is formed. If this does not produce the desired effect, find the artery which supplies the wound, and press it as firmly as possible. If this is not successful, place the patient on his back, and hold up wounded arm or leg, and compress the artery by placing a large, firm knot in a handkerchief over it, tying it about the limb, and tightening it by passing a stick through it, and twisting it until the flow is stopped. When the bleeding ceases, remove the foreign substances and the clots by a stream of water from a sponge, and bring the edges carefully together, holding them in place by strips of adhesive plaster. The best dressing is the "water dressing;" but it must be used with an adhesive plaster which is not dissolved by water. If chilliness appears from the use of water, it must be discontinued for a time. After twenty-four hours the linen dressing may be removed, and renewed if the wound is clear of discharge of blood or other material; and the same treatment must be continued, remembering that all foreign substances are injurious and should be removed. Whenever<pb n="429" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=424"/>
the wound does not heal properly by this process, owing to the condition of the patient, a physician should be consulted. If any part of the body has been cut off, it should be cleaned of foreign matter, and at once replaced, wrapped in cotton to retain warmth, and a gentle pressure kept on it to retain it in place. Circulation is often restored and the union made complete.</p><p>Punctured wounds need a pad at the surface to cause clotting of the blood in the wound, but are otherwise treated like cuts. If pain follows and inflammation ensues, the pad must be removed to permit the results of the inflammation to escape. Thorns or splinters, when run into the flesh, should be removed by cutting in far enough to get hold of and draw them out. Slivers under the nail, when not reached from the end, should be removed by scraping the nail thin, and cutting through it to the foreign body, and so withdrawing it; the part should then be tied with a cloth wet with water, in which a few drops of laudanum have been mixed. A puncture, by a rusty nail or some such substance, of the finger, toe, hand, or foot, frequently causes inflammation, and yet there is not room for the foreign matter left in the wound to escape through the tough skin, and lock-jaw results; in all such cases the wound should be cut open to provide a way of escape for the blood, etc., and a piece of linen wet with laudanum inserted. Wounds from bruises and lacerations especially demand careful treatment, on the same general principles given above.</p><p>STING OF INSECTS--Are relieved by the application of ammonia, or common table salt, well rubbed in, or a slice of an onion, to the part.</p><p>BITES OF DOGS.--The only safe remedy in case of a bite from a dog suspected of madness, is to burn out the wound thoroughly with a red-hot iron, so as to destroy the entire surface of the wound.</p><p>POISONOUS WOUNDS.--Wounds by which poison has been carried into the system require instant treatment. The wound must be burned out by a stick of lunar caustic, or by inserting a large, red-hot nail.</p><p>BITES OF SERPENTS.--When bitten by a rattlesnake, or other poisonous serpent, pinch the skin, and, if the wound can be reached, suck out all the blood possible; if the skin of the lips and mouth is sound, no harm will be done. Whisky or brandy should, however, be administered freely, to intoxication.</p><p>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.--The particle almost invariably lodges under the upper lid, adhering to it. If that lid is grasped by the thumb and finger, drawn outward and then downward, and then released, the lashes of the lower lid act as brush, and sweep off the intruder. If, however, it adheres to the eye-ball, it may be removed by rolling the upper lid over a knitting-needle, and holding it there in such a position as to expose the surface, when the particle can be removed by the corner of a handkerchief. Sometimes it may become imbedded in the membrane which covers the eye-ball, or eye-lid, and require the aid of a surgeon. Never use any of the eye-waters, lotions, or salves, advertised as popular. A particle of lime in the eye is very dangerous, and vinegar diluted with water should be applied at once; even when done immediately the eye will be seriously inflamed.</p><p>FOREIGN BODY IN NOSTRIL.--Children often push foreign bodies up the nostril. To remove it, make the child draw a full breath, and then, closing the other nostril with the finger and the mouth with the hand, expel the air from the lungs by a sharp blow on the back. If it can not be removed in this way, compress the nostril above it to prevent its going up any further, and hook it out with the bent end of a wire or bodkin. If this fails, call a surgeon.</p><pb n="430" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=425"/><p>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.--Take the head of the child between the knees, face downward, and inject a stream of warm water into the ear, holding the nozzle of the syringe outside, so as to allow the foreign body to come out with the water. Probing, with any substance whatever, is very dangerous, and may inflict permanent injury. When the above plan does not succeed, call a surgeon. Kill insects that get into the ear by pouring in sweet oil or glycerine, which drowns and brings them to the surface.</p><p>FREEZING.--Keep the frozen person, or part, away from the heat. If the person is insensible, take him to a cold room, remove clothing, rub with snow or cloths wrung out of ice-water. The cold friction should be kept up for sometime; and when the frozen parts show signs of life, the patient should be carefully dried and put into a cold bed in a cold room, and artificial respiration used until the natural is restored; and then brandy, beef-tea, and ginger-tea administered. The patient must be brought by degrees into the warmer air. Parts frozen should be treated by the same rule.</p><p>CHILBLAINS--Are the result of a chilling of the part. To cure, keep away from the fire, and at night, before going to bed, wash in cold water, or rub in snow, and apply the compound resin ointment, made by all druggists, with a little oil of turpentine added to it.</p><p>EPILEPTIC FITS.--In these there is nothing which a by-stander or friend can do, except to keep out of reach such articles as may injure the patient during the convulsive movements; to loosen the clothing about the neck and throat, and to assist to some place of safety when the semi-conscious state returns. Other convulsions are treated in the same manner.</p><p>BURNING-HOUSES.--When a house is on fire, close all the doors, and prevent currents of air. If the fire could be entirely shut in, it would smother and die out. The check will give time to get help, or, at least, to remove furniture and make all lives secure. If up-stairs when the stairway below is on fire, tear clothing to make cords to let yourself down by. If a room is full of smoke and flame, crawl on the floor, as the lower air is the colder.</p><p>PANICS.--If in a public hall in a panic, keep your seat; even in case of fire the chance of life is greater if free from the crowd.</p><p>RUNAWAYS.--In all runaways it is safer to remain in the vehicle, and to stop with it, than to jump while the horse is running. The vehicle helps to break the shock of the final stop.</p><p>BREAKING THROUGH ICE.--In assisting persons who have broken through ice, get a long pole, or stick, or board, to distribute the weight over a greater surface of ice. In attempting to get out of water upon the ice, after having fallen in, the best way is to approach it sidewise, and roll out rather than to attempt to raise the body up by the arms alone, as the weight is more widely distributed.</p><p>A LIFE-PRESERVER.--A felt or silk hat held so as to keep the crown full of air will sustain a person above water for a great length of time.</p>
<section><hd align="center">ANTIDOTES TO POISONS.</hd><p>The first thing to do is to cause their rejection by vomiting, to do which place mustard mixed with salt on the tongue, or give large quantities of lukewarm water, or tickle the throat with a feather. These failing, instantly resort to active emotics, like tartar emetic, sulphate of copper, or sulphate of zinc. After vomiting has taken place with these, continue it if possible by copious draughts of warm water till the poison is entirely removed. Of course, if vomiting can not be induced, the stomach pump must be employed, especially if arsenic or narcotics have been taken.

<chapter class1="medhealth"><pb n="432" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=427"/><hd align="center" size="larger">MEDICAL.</hd><p>DIPTHERIA.--The first symptoms are great debility, fever, and the characteristic deposits. These may appear on one or both tonsils, the back of the throat, or the arches of the palate. Frequently, there is some swelling of the glands on the neck and under the jaw. Its progress is shown by an increase of the fetor of the breath; by an extension of the deposits into the cheeks, or into the larynx and bronchi; by an extension upwards through the passages into the nose or into the passage to the ear. The swelling of the glands increases with the progress of the attack.</p><p>The unfavorable symptoms that may present themselves while the deposits are spreading, are: Decrease of, or entire suppression of urine, great restlessness and tossing about, followed by stupor, from which the patient is awakened by attacks of suffocation. The fever during this time has been increasing, the pulse becomes smaller and harder, or intermittent or slower.</p><p>The favorable indications are an arrest of the further development of the characteristic deposits and their gradually more definite boundaries, the edges standing out more prominently above the mucus membrane, the swelling of which diminishes, and the patches begin to break up into smaller sections, or separate and come off by the efforts of coughing or to clear out the throat.</p><p>The characteristic symptoms of this disease are the great weakness, the small, hard, and frequent pulse, and the odor from the secretions of the parts affected. The attendant symptoms are as various as the modifications of individual constitutions and temperaments.</p><p>When attacked with diphtheria the patient must be kept in bed with sufficient clothing over the body to give the utmost comfort, and <emph rend="italic">no more.</emph> The mind must be kept tranquil by quiet, and the room thoroughly pure by indirect ventilation. At the same time give nourishment regularly every two hours of well prepared beef-tea. If made by putting the beef into a bottle without water, and boiling, a large spoonful will do for an adult, and less according to the age. The neglect to nourish the patient well in the early stages of the disease is the one persistent error of the profession. The rapid destruction of the blood by the disease does not, as in typhoid states, suspend the functions of nutrition by diversion of the vital forces, but creates a demand for supply of blood to meet the exhaustion incident to the waste which the results will demonstrate. The appropriate medication may arrest the local manifestation of the blood-poison, but will not re-supply the loss of vitalized blood upon which, after all, the recovery depends.</p><p>The domestic treatment of this terrible disease will be confined to the earliest stage, unless it be in the milder cases, and hence only the more common symptoms will be anticipated. If possible, obtain a competent physician at once in any event, and get his decision as to the gravity of the case, for many which appear as the slightest are really the most serious, while, as is often the case, a simple, common sore throat gives friends the direst apprehension.</p><p>A case having arisen, begin at once with aconite and belladonna, alternately every hour. If after four hours there is no improvement, and the<pb n="433" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=428"/>characteristic prostration, and the patches on the tonsils are increasing, stop the aconite, and supply its place with the proto-iodide of mercurius.</p><p>Let these two remedies be continued until there is a marked change for better or worse. If for the former, let the intervals be increased to one and a half or two hours; for the latter, and there is approaching unconsciousness, with frequent arousing to cough up or hawk up the detached fragments fo the deposits, that brings up tough, ropy, yellowish mucus, give kall bichromicum alone every hour.</p><p>When the patient becomes really better, stop, and give no more medicine while the improvement goes on satisfactorily.<contributor rend="italic">--P.

<p>FOR CONSTIPATION.--The same remedies will not affect all persons. One or two figs eaten fasting is sufficient for some, and they are especially good in the case of children, as there is no trouble in getting them to take them. A spoonful of bran in a glass of water is a simple remedy and quite effective. One or two tumblers of hot water will move almost every one, but is difficult to take. In chronic cases a faithful manipulation and moving of bowels and limbs with gentle rotary movement with the open palm, and giving all natural motions to the parts, with proper diet, will almost invariably secure the desired result. It has been known to cure a case of life-long habit, where inherited too, and although it involves patience and perseverance it is certainly better than to suffer the ills that result from so many patent medicines and quack nostrums. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," and <emph rend="italic">regularity of habit</emph> in this matter is the great thing to be impressed on people generally.</p><p>CATARRH.--Wet and cold at the surface of the body is a cause of catarrh, but the most fruitful source is wet and cold feet, and yet there is nothing more easy to avoid. Warm socks, horse-hair soles, and goloshes will always keep the feet dry and warm. It does not seem to be understood that although a boot or shoe may not leak, yet if the sole is damp, it by evaporation conducts away the heat from the foot, and ought never to be worn when not exercising. The neck should be covered lightly, but too much covering predisposes to catarrhal troubles by causing congestion of the membrane affected in this disease. Bed-rooms ought to be well aired, and warmed if possible, by an open fire, in damp chilly weather.</p>

<p>SCARLET FEVER--Like small pox, spreads by infection and contagion. The first symptom is generally vomiting; fever soon sets in: the throat is slightly sore; there is headache, thirst, restlessness, and slight delirium at night. These symptoms continue about forty-eight hours, when the rash makes its appearance over the lower part of the neck and upper part of the chest. This rash is of a bright scarlet in healthy persons, having a velvety appearance, but not raised or rough. On the second day of the rash it spreads over the body, and on the third over the limbs. At this period it begins to fade on the chest and body, and the third day from its appearance on the hands and feet it disappears altogether. It returns, however, as a slight blush for several days, with more or less fever. With the subsidence of the eruption there appears over the body a dandruff-like scurf. This stage is very dangerous, from the fact that the removal of this outer coating renders the patient peculiarly liable to suppression of perspiration on the slightest exposure to cold. Judicious nursing is far more important than medicines, but no case should be without a competent physician The room should have a uniform temperature day and night of about 68&#176; to 70&#176; should be well aired, without exposure to drafts. In this room the patient should remain until thoroughly well, unless it be in the summer season. The clothing should be light during the rash, and increased after it until convalescence is established. Give cold drinks very sparingly. When the skin is hot, sponge the body frequently. It is well to bind a piece of fat salt pork on the throat, or put around it a light flannel scarf, rubbing the throat daily and freely with camphorated oil. The diet should consist of light gruels and liquids until the eruption subsides, when it may be solid but still simple. After the early stages are passed, the danger will depend upon the exposure of the new tender surface to cold, and the resulting dropsy. The change of an article of clothing, lowering of temperature in the room at night, stepping into a cold room, are but few of the many ways of so chilling the skin as to suppress perspiration and induce dropsy. There are two simple methods of rendering patients less liable to dropsy after scarlet fever. First, rub them over frequently with fatty substances, as lard, or oil, or cocoa butter; second, frequent warm baths during convalescence. After the bath great care should be taken to remove the refuse water beyond the reach of exposure, or disinfect it.<contributor rend="italic">--By an eminent physician.</contributor></p><p>DIPHTHERIA SYMPTOMS.--Diphtheria appears in three varieties, which are thus briefly described: 1. Fever, severe pains in the back and limbs, and very great prostration. There may be no soreness of the throat, but small<pb n="439" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=434"/>white specks will be noticed on the toneils. 2. Large patches of false membrane both on the tonsils and back of the throat; but the glands of the neck do not become swollen. 3. True malignant diphtheria, with swelling of the glands of the neck and under the jaw; profuse and often offensive exudations in the mouth and throat; more or less discharge from the nostrils. Simple treatment will usually cuase a recovery in a majority of cases under the first and second varieties Chlorate of potash put into a tumbler of water until no more will dissolve, is the best remedy for home use in the early stages of the disease. But the advice of a good physician should be sought on the appearance of the first symptoms of this dangerous disease, as prompt measures are often necessary to save life.</p>

And this train of thought came into my mind this morning from seeing a lovely morning-glory vine adorning the plain fence which surrounds my garden, glorifying it with its bewitching grace and brilliant color, illuminating the whole landscape, giving sweet thoughts to the working man as he goes forth to his toil, lighting up with pleasure the faces of the little children as they pass along to school, and warming and brightening wonderfully the heart of the careworn, anxious mother with recollections of her merry girlhood time, when <emph rend="italic">her</emph> precious mother took the responsibilities of housekeeping, and she sang merrily as she trained the vines and arranged the vases and bouquets, to make the dear home bright and beautiful. And as I admire the freshness of the new-made blossoms, I wonder if Eve had any thing in Eden more lovely and delicate, and if she, surrounded by a wealth and luxuriance of flowers, with Adam to dress and train them for her, appreciated them as much, or looked upon them as lovingly as we do our floral beauties, for which we labor and toil. I can hardly believe she did, and thinking it all over, it seems to me that it is our duty and should make a large part of our enjoyment to cultivate these beautiful vines which grow so readily and reward us so well, in greater profusion so that all who pass by them on their way to daily toil, may inhale large draughts of pleasure from their coronets of many-colored blossoms, arrayed in such wondrous beauty as far surpasses Solomon in all his glory, and may be led by their silent unintrusive teachings to thank God for His beautiful gifts, and to love Him sincerely<pb n="441" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=436"/>for strewing the rough paths of life with such perfect unsullied loveliness.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. Gen. Van Cleve, Minneapolis, Minn.</contributor></p><p>HOUSE PLANTS.--Plants that require a high or low temperature, or a very moist atmosphere, and plants that bloom only in summer are undesirable. Procure fresh sandy loam, with an equal mixture of well rotted turf, leaf mold and cow-yard manure, with a small quantity of soot. In repotting use one size larger than they were grown in; hard burned or glazed pots prevent the circulation of air. Secure drainage by broken crockery and pebbles laid in the bottom of the pot. An abundance of light is important, and when this can not be given, it is useless to attempt the culture of flowering plants. If possible they should have the morning sun, as one hour of sunshine then is worth two in the afternoon. Fresh air is also essential, but cold, chilling draughts should be avoided. Water from one to three times a week with soft luke-warm water, draining off all not absorbed by the earth. Do not permit water to stand in the saucers, as the only plant thriving under such treatment are calla lilies, and even for these it is not necessary unless while blooming. Dust is a great obstacle to the growth of plants; a good showering will generally remove it, but all the smooth-leaved plants, such as camellias, ivies, etc., should be occasionally sponged to keep the foliage clean and healthy. Plants succeed best in an even temperature ranging from sixty to seventy degrees during the day, with from ten to twelve degrees lower at night. If troubled with insects put them under a box or barrel and smoke from thirty to sixty minutes with tobacco leaves. For the red spider, the best remedy if to lay the plants on the side and sprinkle well or shower. Repeat if necessary. The soil should be frequently stirred to prevent caking. If manures are used give in a liquid form. Some of the most suitable plants for parlor culture are pelargoniums, geraniums, fuchsias, palms, begonias, monthly roses, camellias, azaleas, oranges, lemons, Chinese and English primroses, abutilons, narcissus, heliotrope, stevias, bouvardias, petunias, and the gorgeous flowering plant <emph rend="italic">poinsettia pulcherrima.</emph> Camellias and azaleas require a cooler temperature than most plants, and the <emph rend="italic">poinsettia</emph> a higher temperature. Do not sprinkle the foliage of the camellias while the flower-buds are swelling, as it will cause them to droop, nor sprinkle them in the sunshine. They should have a temperature of about forty degrees and more shade. By following these rules, healthy flowering plants will be the result.<contributor rend="italic">--J. S. Robinson.</contributor></p><p>THE CARE OF HOUSE PLANTS.--When plants are frosted sprinkle with fresh cold water, and place under a box or something that will exclude the light and prevent too great a change in temperature. Keep them thus for two days. After sprinkling, be careful to put them where they will not chill again. Horse-manure, two years old, is best for carnations. For begonias good drainage is indispensable. The whole family thrive in a compost of one-half loam and one-half leaf-mold with a slight portion of sand. From September to February give pelargoniums only enough water to keep them from wilting; then water freely, and when they begin to bud, apply a little liquid-manure, or add ammonia to the water twice a week. Double geraniums should be kept in small pots, as they will not bloom well until the roots become compact. They require a higher temperature than the single varieties. During warm weather, the foliage of fuchsias should be well sprinkled every evening to prevent its becoming seared too early. To obtain plants of the greatest beauty in form and color, plenty of light and space<pb n="442" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=437"/>
is essential. Do not allow the foliage of one plant to overshadow another.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. Prof. F. Wood.</contributor></p><p>HINTS ABOUT PLANTS.--Few things are necessary for the successful cultivation of house plants. A patient, untiring spirit is most important. The other requisites are plenty of sunlight, fresh air, and water when they need it. It is better to give a good supply of water when called for by drooping leaves, than to give a little at a time often. Never leave pots to set in water in saucers except for the calla lily. To repot, turn plant upside down on the left hand, rap pot sharply with stick; this will loosen it from the ball of earth; lift it off, and place the plant in a pot two sizes larger, or in the ground. Do not have the soil too rich with manure but well mixed, and composed of sod-soil, wild or leaf-mold, and well-rotted stable manure. Cut plants back pretty closely when you change them, and they will thrive better afterwards. Water well at first, then only moisten slightly until they begin to grow. A good rule for watering plants is once a week in winter if the weather is mild, or when it has moderated have a gallon watering-can filled with blood-warm water, stir in a tea-spoonful of aqua ammonia, and as you set the plants in a convenient place (I set mine on the kitchen floor), pour in pot a plentiful supply of this warm water, and after this, sprinkle well with warm water without ammonia. In summer two or three times a week is the rule. Ivies, need large pots, and should be repotted every year in the summer time.</p><p>A good way to start slips is to partly break off the slip, but do not entirely sever it from the parent stock, leaving it hanging for ten or twelve days; then remove, and plant in a box of half sand or brick-dust and half leaf-mold, and it will be well rooted in a week. Do not water too freely, or the slip will rot. This is better for both slip and plant, as the slip will get nourishment from plant while healing over, and its removal will not weaken the plant so much. Hyacinths are very attractive flowers for window-gardening, and at the same time require very little care or trouble. Get the bulbs in the fall before frost from any good florist (Vick is my favorite), and keep in a cool place until December, then plant each one in a four-inch pot with soil one-fourth sand, one-fourth well-rotted manure, one-fourth garden or sod-soil, and one-fourth broken bits of moss and leaf-mold; water thoroughly at first, and set in dark closet until the first of January, then bring to light, and give plenty of water. A very good way is to set half a dozen or more pots in a large <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> pour hot (not boiling) water in the pan, and let set for one hour. After they are done blooming, let them dry out gradually. They will not bloom the second season as well as the first.<contributor rend="italic">--M. E. C.</contributor></p><p>IF HOUSE PLANTS--Are watered once a week with water in which are mixed a few drops of ammonia, they will thrive much better. Sometimes small white worms are found in the earth; lime-water will kill them. Stir up the soil before pouring it on to expose as many as possible. For running vines burn beef-bones, pulverize, and mix with the earth.</p><p>TO KEEP PLANTS WITHOUT A FIRE AT NIGHT.--Have made of wood or zinc, a tray about four inches deep, with a handle on either end, water tight--paint it outside and in, put in each corner a post as high as the tallest of your plants, and it is ready for use. Arrange your flower pots in it, and fill between them with sawdust, this absorbs the moisture falling from the plants when you water them, and retains the warmth acquired during the day, keeping the temperature of the roots even. When you retire at night spread over the posts a blanket or shawl, and there is no danger of freezing. The tray may be placed on a a stand or table and easily moved about.</p><pb n="443" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=438"/><p>WINDOW GARDENING.--All the varieties of English ivy, the hoyacarnosa, the passion flower, the jasmine, the pilogyne suavis, and begonias are especially suitable for window culture. Very pretty effects may be produced at the cost of a few cents, by planting verbenas, morning-glories, cobea scandens, and the maurandias in baskets or flower-pots, which may be concealed behind statuary or bronzes. The best fertilizer for them or any other house plants is that afforded by the tea-pot; the cold tea-grounds usually thrown away, if poured as a libation to these household fairies, will produce a miracle of beauty and perfume.</p>

<purpose>SURE SHOT FOR ROSE SLUGS.</purpose>
--Make a tea of <ingredient>tobacco-stems</ingredient> and a soap-suds of <ingredient>whale-oil or carbolic soap,</ingredient> mix, and apply to the bush with a sprinkler, turning the bush so as to wet the under as well as the upper part of the leaves; apply before the sun is up three or four times.</p>
<p><variation>ANOTHER.--About the first of June, small worms make their appearance on the rose bushes, and in a very few days eat every leaf on them; to destroy these pests take four gallons <ingredient>water,</ingredient> add one table-spoon <ingredient>paris green,</ingredient> stir thoroughly, and apply to the bushes with a garden syringe or watering-pot, early in the morning; keep the water well stirred or shaken while applying, or the last in the pot will be too strong and kill the leaves of the bushes.</variation><contributor rend="italic">--Mr. C. Phellis, Sr.</contributor></p></formula>
<p>TO PREPARE AUTUMN LEAVES AND FERNS.--Immediately after gathering, take a moderately warm iron, smear it well with white wax, rub over each surface of the leaf once, apply more wax for each leaf; this process causes leaves to roll about as when hanging on the tree. If pressed more they become brittle and remain perfectly flat. Maple and oak are among the most desirable, and may be gathered any time after the severe frosts; but the sumac and ivy must be secured as soon after the first slight frost, as they become tinted, or the leaflets will fall from the stem. Ferns may be selected any time during the season. A large book must be used in gathering them, as they will be spoiled for pressing if carried in the hand. A weight should be placed on them until they are perfectly dry; then, excepting the most delicate ones, it will be well to press them like the leaves, as they are liable to curl when placed in a warm atmosphere; these will form beautiful combinations with the sumac and ivy.</p>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>
<purpose>TO PREPARE SKELETON LEAVES.</purpose>
--When properly prepared, skeleton leaves form a companion to the scrap-book or collection of pressed ferns, fronds, etc. This is a tedious operation, and requires skill and great patience to obtain satisfactory results. Some leaves are easier to dissect and make better specimens than others, and as a rule a hard, thin leaf should be chosen; that is, when a special variety is not required. Among those which are skeletonized, most successfully, are the English ivy, box elder, willow, grape, pear, rose, etc. They should be gathered during the month of June, or as soon as the leaf is fully developed. The leaves should be immersed in a vessel of rain-water, and allowed to remain till decomposed; when this takes place, press the leaf between pieces of soft flannel, and the film will adhere to the flannel, leaving a perfect net-work; dry off gradually, and clean the specimen with a soft <implement>hair-pencil,</implement> place between folds of soft blotting-paper, and when perfectly dry, place in your collection. <variation><purpose>To bleach the leaves,</purpose>

<purpose>TO KILL EARTHWORMS.</purpose>
--Ten drops of <ingredient>carbolic acid</ingredient> in a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> poured over earth in flower-pots will kill all earthworms.</p></formula>
<p>CUT FLOWERS.--Large <implement>soup-plates</implement> or dishes, filled with wet sand or wet cotton, will keep cut flowers fresh for a long while, or many seeds may be started in such receptacles, and will grow luxuriantly in them.</p><p>TEMPERATURE.--The principal difficulty in keeping house-plants healthy is overheated rooms; the temperature should never go above 80&#176; nor below 40&#176;, in order to keep plants healthy.</p><p>TO KEEP CUT ROSES FRESH.--Roses, camellias, and all hard-wooded flowers, such as are used for head-dresses, button-hole bouquets, etc., may be kept fresh, and their beauty preserved by the following plan: Cut stems off at right angles, and apply hot sealing-wax to the end of the stalk immediately; this prevents the sap flowing downwards, thereby preserving the flower.<contributor rend="italic">--Gov. Kemper, Virginia, 1788.</contributor></p><p>IVIES.--A successful cultivator of ivies feeds them with iron and cod-liver oil; the iron in form of rusty nails, mixed into the earth. Another produced a luxurious growth by watering once a week with tobacco-water; making a tea of refuse tobacco-leaves and stems, or of coarse tobacco. The water from the washing of fresh beef is also of great benefit to ivies.</p><p>TO REVIVE WITHERING FLOWERS.--Take them from the vase, throw out the cold water, and replace it with hot water in which you can hardly hold your finger, put in it the flowers immediately; or burn the ends; or throw a little salt in the water. The effect is wonderful.</p><p>FLOWERS FOR TABLE.--A very beautiful way to arrange flowers is to use tin forms, filled with water or sand, made in any desired shape, such as crosses, circles, half-circles, triangles, etc. They are made easily by any tinner, and should be about one inch deep. Tiny forms of tin in the shape of the letters of the alphabet, containing the initial letter of the name of the guest, may be placed at the plate to which each is assigned. The flowers may be arranged so as to conceal the tin form if desired.</p><p>WARM WATER.--Plants will thrive much better if warm water is used upon them instead of cold. If every saucer is filled with boiling water every morning, it will add to the luxuriance of the plant, and frequently no other moisture will be needed for several days; tea-leaves can also be added in small quantities to the soil of the pots. Ivies are always beautified by such an application, and it is an excellent thing to wet a sponge in tea, and moisten the leaves with it. Wax plants are especially susceptible to the benefit of warm water application.</p><p>HANGING BASKETS.--A correspondent of the <emph rend="italic">Gardner's Monthly</emph> tells of a new style of hanging basket made of round maple sticks, about one inch in diameter, eight inches in length at the bottom, increasing to fourteen at the top. In constructing, begin at the bottom and build up, log-cabin fashion; chink the openings with green moss, and line the whole basket with the same. They are easily kept moist, and the plants droop and twine over them very gracefully. A good way to keep the earth moist in a hanging basket without the bother of taking it down, is to fill a bottle with water and put in two pieces of yarn, leaving one end outside. Suspend the bottle just above the basket, and allow the water to drip; this well keep the earth moist enough for winter, and save a great deal of time and labor. Plant morning-glory seeds in hanging baskets in winter: they grow rapidly and are very pretty.</p></chapter>

Silk intended for dress should not be kept in the house long, as lying in folds causes it to crack or split, particularly if thickened with gum. White satin dresses should be pinned up in blue paper, with coarse brown paper on the outside, sewed together on the edge.</p><p>TO REMOVE STAINS FROM THE HANDS.--Damp the hands first with water, and then rub them with tartaric acid or salts of lemon, as you would with soap, rinse them, and rub them dry. Tartaric acid or salts of lemon will quickly remove stains from linens. Put less than a half tea-spoonful of salts or acid in a table-spoonful of water, wet the stain with it, and lay it in the sun for at least an hour; wet it once or twice in the time with cold water. If it does not remove the stain, repeat and lay it again in the sun.</p>

<p>CHICKENS.--Should not be fed for twenty-four hours after they are out of the shell; then feed moderately but often on soft cooked food. Hard boiled eggs and milk or mush and chopped feed are excellent for a day or two. Boiled potatoes and hashed meat are both good food. Always keep pure water within reach.</p><p>TO "DO UP" BLACK SILK.--Boil an old kid glove (cut up in small shreds) in a pint of water till the water is reduced to a half pint; then sponge the silk with it; fold it down tight, and, ten minutes after, iron it on the wrong side while wet. The silk will retain its softness and luster, and, at the same time, have the "body" of new silk.</p><p>EXCELLENT INTEREST RULES--For finding the interest on any principal for any number of days, the answer in each case being in cents; separate the two right hand figures to express it in dollars and cents.</p><p><list><item><emph rend="italic">Four per cent.</emph>--Multiply the principal by the number of days to run; separate the right hand figure from the product, and divide by 9.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Five per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, and divide by 72.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Six per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, separate right hand figure, and divide by 6.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Eight per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, and divide by 45.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Nine per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, separate right hand figure, and divide by 4.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Ten per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, and divide by 36.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Twelve per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, separate right hand figure, and divide by 3.</item><item><emph rend="italic">Fifteen per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, and divide by 24.</item><pb n="449" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=444"/><item><emph rend="italic">Eighteen per cent.</emph>--Multiply by number of days, separate right hand figure, and divide by 2.</item></list></p><p>TO BUILD A CHIMNEY.--Fire-places for a parlor or sitting-room should be about two feet and eight or ten inches between jams, and about the same height, and eight or nine inches deep. The jams should flare about four inches, so as to leave the back two feet between jams. The back should be carried up plumb fourteen or fifteen inches, and then gradually brought forward six inches to a level with the mantel bar, and then two more courses laid plumb, all backed up solid. This offset forms a shelf which sustains the weight of the cold air, which must be set in motion before the fire begins to draw. The fire and hot air, passing through the narrow threat, forms an eddy at the shelf, and the draft is at once established as the warmer air moves upward. Two or three of these offsets do no harm if it is convenient to put them in. The flue of the chimney should gradually taper to twelve by twelve, or even ten by ten inches when the building is two stories.</p><p>TO CLEAN LIGHT KIDS.--Put the glove on the hand, and rub thoroughly with white corn meal, using a piece of cotton flannel.</p><p>TO REMOVE GREASE FROM SILK, COTTON, LINEN, OR WORSTED GOODS.--Rub magnesia freely on both sides of silk or worsted goods and hang away. Benzine, ether, or soap will take out spots from silk, but remember the goods must not be rubbed. Oil of turpentine or benzine will remove spots of paint, varnish, or pitch from white or colored cotton or woolen goods. After using it they should be washed in soap-suds. Spots from sperm candles, stearine, and the like, should be softened and removed by ninety-five per cent. alcohol, then sponged off with a weak alcohol and a small quantity of ammonia added to it. Holding white cotton or linen over the fumes of burning sulphur, and wetting in warm chlorine water, will take out wine or fruit stains. The sooner the remedy is applied, after any of these spots or stains are discovered, the more effectual the restoration. From white linen or cotton by soap-suds or weak lye, and from calicoes with warm soap-suds. From woolens by soap-suds or ammonia. On silks use either yolk of egg with water, magnesia, ether, benzine, ammonia, or French chalk.</p><p>LIME-WATER AND ITS USES.--Place a piece of unslaked lime (size is immaterial, as the water will take up only a certain quantity) in a perfectly clean bottle, and fill with cold water; keep corked in a cellar or a cool dark place; it is ready for use in a few minutes, and the clear lime-water may be used whenever it is needed. When the water is poured off, add more; this may be done three or four times, after which, some new lime must be used as at first. A tea-spoon in a cup of milk is a remedy for children's summer complaint; also for acidity of the stomach; when added to milk it has no unpleasant taste. When put into milk that would otherwise curdle when heated, it prevents its curdling, so that it can then be used for puddings and pies. A small quantity of it will prevent the "turning" of cream and milk. It also sweetens and purifies bottles which have contained milk. Some add a cupful to a sponge of bread to prevent it from souring.</p><p>THE LIGHTNING ROD.--When properly put up, the lightning rod is a perfect protection; but, when not scientifically constructed, is only a source of danger. The following are essentials: 1. It must extend several feet into the ground so as <emph rend="italic">always to be in contact with moist earth,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">into a never-failing</emph> supply of water; 2. It must be <emph rend="italic">sharp</emph> at the top, and, if there are several points, all the better; 3. It must be half as high above the top of the building as the distance horizontally to the most remote part of the roof of the building; 4. It should be large enough to convey off every discharge<pb n="450" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=445"/>
without being melted or broken; 5. The best material is iron with copper below the surface of the ground, as iron rusts away rapidly in the moist earth. Copper is the best conductor, but costs more and is not as stiff to withstand the wind. One-half to five-eighths of an inch in diameter is large enough. Bright points are not essential, and glass insulators are of no use whatever, as when wet they are good conductors, and, even if they were not, a small charge even would leap across the short distance from the rod to the iron staple. The best way to fasten the joints, is to weld them, which any black-smith can do, passing the rod through opposite doors of his shop, afterwards dragging it home. If the building is so high that it can not be readily put up in one piece, the best joint is made by screwing the two ends firmly into one nut. The points are easily made by welding several smaller wires to the large one, and filing them sharp. A rod will protect a space the distance of which is four times the height of the rod. The cheapest and best support is wood. The only point to be considered is to secure the rod firmly. The round rods are the best. If there are iron water-pipes or steam-pipes in the building, they should all be connected with the lightning rod, or directly with the moist earth, eight or ten feet below the surface.</p><p>THE CISTERN.--An abundant supply of good water is a necessity for every house, and capacious cisterns are a necessity. Two essential requisites are good hydraulic lime and clean pure sand. The hydraulic cement becomes in a few months as hard as sandstone, but the sand must never exceed two parts to one of lime. The cheapest form of cistern is simply a hole dug in the ground with sides sloping like those of a narrow-bottomed tub. The water-lime mortar is applied directly to these sides, the shape of the sides sustaining the mortar until it hardens. The breadth of such a cistern, if large, makes it difficult to cover, but this may be done with plank supported by strong scantling, over which should be placed earth to the depth of the lowest frost. There must be a hole through the covering, left for cleaning, which should be curbed, and may admit the pump if the locality is right, or a pipe may go from cistern into cellar below the frost-line, and thence to the kitchen. The mortar on the walls should never be less than an inch thick, and they should have at least two coats, and three are better. As the mortar begins to dry in a very short time after mixing, it is best to mix the lime and sand dry, and apply water to small quantities at a time as needed. A more capacious cistern may be made at a greater expense by digging a hole with perpendicular walls, and laying walls of brick in the form of the upper half of a barrel, on which to lay the mortar. This form has a smaller top, and is much more easily covered than the other. The wall should be laid as well as plastered with water-lime. A filtering attachment is made by building a small receiving cistern beside the larger one, with filtering apparatus between them, or a strong wall may be built through the middle of the cistern, receiving the water in one division and filtering it through into the other.</p><p>CONTENTS OF CISTERN.--The following gives the contents of a cistern for each foot in depth. If the diameter at top and bottom differ, strike the average and use that as the basis of the estimate:</p><p>
<table columns="2"><row><cell>5 feet diameter &#32; 4.66 barrels.</cell><cell>8 feet diameter &#32; 11.93 barrels.</cell></row><row><cell>6 &#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 6.71 &#32;&#32;"</cell><cell>9 &#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 15.10 &#32;&#32;"</cell></row><row><cell>7 &#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 9.13 &#32;&#32;"</cell><cell>10 &#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;" &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 18.65 &#32;&#32;"</cell></row></table></p><p>WEIGHT OF GRAIN.--Wheat 60 pounds in all states except Connecticut, where it is 56; corn 56, except in New York, where it is 58; oats 32; barley 48; buckwheat 46 to 50, but generally 48; clover seed 60, but 64 in Ohio and <pb n="451" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=446"/>
New Jersey; timothy 44; flax seed 56; potatoes 60; beans 60, but in Ohio 56, and New York 62; dried peaches 28 to 33; dried apples 22 to 28.</p><p>MOCKING-BIRDS--Should have large cages with tight board backs, kept scrupulously clean. Cover the bottom of the tray with paper, and on it spread sand, fine gravel and bones that have been burned and powdered. Hang a small bag of sulphur in the top of the cage, and red pepper in the pod should be tied to the sides. Give meat of some sort every day; either a bit of beefsteak half an inch long and the size of the little finger (this should be cut with scissors across the grain into small pieces), or grasshoppers, angle-worms, or white garden grubs. Most birds relish apples and berries, and are healthier for eating them. They are also fond of lettuce leaves, which are good food for them. A large bathing dish should be placed in the cage in the morning, and removed after the bird has taken a good bath. Sudden changes of temperature, or hanging the cage in a draft, must be avoided. In buying a bird, question the dealer concerning the kind of food on which it has been brought up; for bird-raisers differ as to what food is best, and success or failure may depend on this knowledge, when it changes owners. Whatever food the bird has been brought up on it is best to continue, or bring about a change gradually. If sick, give a brown spider, and it will generally cure. Sometimes a warm bath will relieve. Occasionally bunches will come on the head: rub on a little camphor, taking care not to get it in the eyes. Almost all diseases come from want of cleanliness or neglect. Sore eyes come from perches that have not been kept clean. They shed their feathers in August, and will not sing, and often act stupid; but their songs will be loud enough when their feathers come again. The male bird is much the <emph rend="italic">best singer.</emph> Some say the female sings a little, and some say only a chirp and a squawk. It is difficult to distinguish them. Bird merchants say that the male birds have nine white feathers on the wing, and the female only eight, and this is the rule usually given. They do not mock with full power until they are a year old. Tunes are best taught them with a flute, the player sitting under the cage and out of sight.</p><p>CANARY BIRDS.--Do not keep in a room that is being painted or has odor of new paint. Do not hang over a stove or grate which contains fire. Do not set the cage in a window, and shut it down upon it; the draft is injurious. Do not wash cage bottom, but scrape clean with a knife, and then put on some fresh gravel; the moisture breeds red mites, and is injurious to the bird. Do not keep the birds you intend to breed in the spring together during the winter. Do not keep single birds in a room where others are breeding, or males and females in mating season in the same room in separate cages, as it is likely to cause mating fever. Feed canary on rape seed, but no hemp. For diarrhea put a rusty piece of iron in water dish, changing water not oftener than twice a week, and bread boiled in milk as for asthma; boil well in this case, so that when cold it will cut like cheese; give freely with plenty of vegetables.</p><p>Moulting is not a disease, yet during this season all birds are more or less sick, and some suffer severely. They require plenty of nourishing food. Worms, insects, and fruits to those which eat them; and to those which live upon dry seeds, bread dipped in milk, fruit and vegetables.<contributor rend="italic">--Mrs. Mary Winget.</contributor></p><p>The German metallic-enameled cages are the best--white and green (a combination of) or a light chocolate are the best colors; they are not painted as are the cages made here in America, but the color is burnt into the wires. Avoid wooden or brass cages, also conical "fountains" for food and drink; for the latter, square or round cups of china or glass are the best. The<pb n="452" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=buck&#38;PageNum=447"/>perches should be plain, round, unvarnished sticks, and no two of the same size. Clean the cage thoroughly every morning. Prepare fresh, clean bathing and drinking water, and if sand is used on the bottom of cage, clean it (the sand) by boiling in water. Scrape the perches well, and twice a week plunge them in boiling water to kill any red mites that may have lodged there. Give plenty of seed, also green parts of many plants, such as poppy, rape, hemp, etc.; also the seeds of weeds like the chickweed, plantain, etc., and the fresh, tender leaves of beets, cabbage and lettuce. Avoid fruits containing a large percentage of acid, but give occasionally a hard-boiled egg. Never give them sugar, but all the red pepper they will eat. It is the best thing for them. And if your bird feels hoarse at any time, put a piece of fat salt pork in the cage and see how the little fellow will enjoy it. Give him flax-seed once in a while, and if he appears dumpy occasionally give him a diet of bread and water, with red pepper sprinkled in.</p><p>For lice, cleanliness is the best preventive, but not always sure. For cure you have simply to cover your cage at night with a white cloth, rise early in the morning, remove the cloth and dip in scalding hot water. Repeat every night as long as there shall be found any vermin upon the cloth.</p><p>In raising birds, make just half the fuss directed in the bird-book over the matter, and you will have, doubtless, better success.</p><p>CHICKADEES IN WINTER.--A cup of pumpkin-seeds, set on the window-sill, will attract chickadees, and they will become quite tame, and are very amusing with their antics. They may be kept about the house from December to May by feeding and kind treatment.</p><p>TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS ON FURNITURE, caused by a hot iron or hot water, or to restore blistered furniture.--Rub with a No. 1 sand-paper somewhat worn, or apply pulverized pumice stone mixed with a few drops of linseed oil, then with a cotton cloth rub on some shellac varnish thinned well with turpentine.--<emph rend="italic">A.
