<p>In this perspective view, from the North-West, drawn by D. Wood, Professor of Civil Engineering, we have an accurate representation of the University Buildings, in 1863. The center one is occupied by the Law Department and Library; the two on the right, by the Literary, Chapel, Museum, &#38;c.; the first on the left, is the Laboratory of Applied Chemistry, and the last, by the Medical Department. The number of Students for the session of 1862-3, notwithstanding the War, reached 662. An entrance fee of only $10, with $5 yearly, pays for a full Literary, Law, Medical, or Civil Engineering Course; the first, requiring four, the two next, two, and the last, three years. No distinction is made between students, resident in Michigan, and those from other States or Kingdoms.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">PREFACE<lb/>TO THE TENTH EDITION.</hd>
<p>IN bringing a permanent work, or one that is designed so to be, before the public, it is expected of the Author that he give his reasons for such publication. If the reasons are founded in truth, the people consequently seeing its necessity, will appreciate its advantages, and encourage the Author by quick and extensive purchases, they alone being the judges. Then:</p>
<p>FIRST.--Much of the information contained in "Dr. Chase's Receipes; or Information for Everybody," has never before been published, and is adapted to every day use.</p>
<p>SECOND.--The Author, after having carried on the Drug and Grocery business for a number of years, read Medicine, after being thirty-eight years of age, and graduated as a Physician to qualify himself for the work he was undertaking; for, having been familiar with some of the Recipes, adapted to these branches of trade, more than twenty years, he began in "Fifty-six," seven years ago, to publish them in a Pamphlet of only a few pages, since which time he has been traveling between New York and Iowa, selling the work and Prescribing, so that up to this time, "Sixty-three," over <emph rend="italic">twenty-three thousand</emph> copies have been sold. His travels have brought him in contact with all classes of Professional and Business men, Mechanics, Farriers, and Farmers, thus enabling him to obtain from them, many additional items, always having had his <emph rend="italic">note book</emph> with him, and whenever a prescription has been given before him, or a remark made, that would have a <emph rend="italic">practical</emph> bearing, it has been <emph rend="italic">noted,</emph> and at the first opportunity <emph rend="italic">tested,</emph> then if good, written out in <emph rend="italic">plain</emph> language expressly for the next edition of
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=12"/>
this work. In this way this mass of information has been collected, and ought to take away an objection which some persons have raised: "It is too much for one man to know!" because they did not realize that the work had been made up from <emph rend="italic">others</emph> as well as the Author's <emph rend="italic">actual every day experience,</emph> instead of from <emph rend="italic">untried</emph> books. Yet from the nature of some of the Recipes, one has occasionally found its way into some of the earlier editions, which have needed revision, or to be entirely dropped. This, with a desire to add to the various Departments, at every edition, has kept us from having it Stereotyped until the present, tenth edition.</p>
<p>But now, all being what we desire; and the size of the work being such that we cannot <emph rend="italic">add</emph> to it without increasing the price above One Dollar, which we will never do, unless in extra binding, we have it Stereotyped, and send it out, just what we expect, and are willing it should remain.</p>
<p>THIRD.--Many of the Recipe books published are very large, containing much <emph rend="italic">useless</emph> matter, only to increase the number, consequently costing too much--this one contains only about eight hundred recipes, upon only about four hundred different subjects, <emph rend="italic">all</emph> of which are valuable in daily, practical life, and at a very reasonable price--many of them are without arrangement--this one is arranged in regular Departments, all of a class being together--many of them are without remark, or explanation--this one is fully explained, and accompanied with remarks upon the various subjects introduced by the Recipes under consideration--those remarks, explanations, and suggestions accompanying the Recipes, are a special feature of <emph rend="italic">this</emph> work, making it worth double its cost as a <emph rend="italic">reading</emph> book, even if there was not a prescription in it.</p>
<p>FOURTH.--The remarks and explanations are in <emph rend="italic">large</emph> type, whilst the <emph rend="italic">prescriptive</emph> and <emph rend="italic">descriptive</emph> parts are in a little smaller type, which enables any one to see at a glance just what they wish to find.</p>
<p>FIFTH.--It is a well known fact that many unprincipled persons go around "gulling" the people by selling single Recipes for exorbitant prices. The Author found a thing, calling himself
 
<pb n="vii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=13"/>
a man, in Battle Creek, Mich., selling a Washing-Fluid Recipe for two dollars, which he obtained of some; but if he could not obtain that, he would take two <emph rend="italic">shillings,</emph> or any other sum between them. A merchant gave a horse for the "White Cement" Recipe. The late Mr. Andrews, of Detroit, Mich., gave <emph rend="italic">three hundred dollars</emph> for a Recipe, now improved and in this work, to cure a bone spavin upon a race mare of his. He removed the spavin with it and won the anticipated wager with her. The Author has, himself, paid from twenty-five to fifty, and seventy-five cents, and one to two, three five, and eight dollars for single items, or Recipes, hoping thereby to improve his work; but often finding that he had much <emph rend="italic">better</emph> ideas already embodied therein.</p>
<p>The amount <emph rend="italic">paid</emph> for information in <emph rend="italic">this</emph> work, and for testing by experiment, together with traveling expenses, and cuts used in illustrating it, have reached over two thousand dollars, and all for the purpose of making a book worthy to be found in "Everybody's" library, and to prevent such extortions in the <emph rend="italic">price</emph> of Recipes. Yet any single Recipe in the work which a person may wish to <emph rend="italic">use,</emph> will often be found worth <emph rend="italic">many</emph> times the price of the book, perhaps the <emph rend="italic">lives</emph> of those you dearly love, by having at hand the necessary information enabling you to <emph rend="italic">immediately</emph> apply the means within your reach, instead of giving time for disease to strengthen, whilst sending, perhaps miles, for a physician. Much pain and suffering, also, will often be saved or avoided, besides the satisfaction of <emph rend="italic">knowing</emph> how many things are made which you are constantly <emph rend="italic">using,</emph> and also being able to avoid many things which you <emph rend="italic">certainly</emph> would <emph rend="italic">avoid,</emph> if you <emph rend="italic">knew</emph> how they were made.</p>
<p>SIXTH.--It will be observed that we have introduced a <emph rend="italic">number</emph> of Recipes upon some of the subjects; this adapts the work to all circumstances and places; the reason for it is this; we have become acquainted with them in our practice and journeyings, and know that when the articles cannot be obtained for one way, they may be for some other way; as also that one prescription is better for some than for other persons; therefore, we give the variety that all may be benefitted as much as possible.

For instance, there are twenty different prescriptions for different diseases, and conditions of the eye; there are also a dozen different liniments, &#38;c., &#38;c.; yet the Author feels well assured that the most perfect satisfaction will be experienced in them as a whole. And although it could not be expected that special advantages of particular Recipes could be pointed out to any great extent, yet the Author must be indulged in referring to a few, in the various Departments. All, or nearly all, Merchants and Grocers, as also most Families, will be more or less benefited by the directions for making or preserving butter, preserving eggs, or fruit, computing interest, making vinegar, and keeping cider palatable, &#38;c. In ague sections of country, none should be without the information on this subject; and in fact, there is not a medical subject introduced but what will be found more or less valuable to every one; even Physicians will be more than compensated in its perusal; whilst Consumptive, Dyspeptic, Rheumatic, and Fever patients ought, by all means, to avail themselves of the advantages here pointed out. The treatment in Female Debility, and the observations on the Changes in female life are such that every one of them over thirteen or fourteen years of age should not be without this work. The directions in Pleurisy and other Inflammatory diseases cannot fail to benefit every family into whose hands the book shall fall.</p>
<p>The Good Samaritan Liniment, we do not believe, has its equal in the world, for common uses, whilst there are a number of other liniments equally well adapted to particular cases. And we would not undertake to raise a family of children without our Whooping Cough Syrup and Croup Remedies, knowing their value as we do, if it cost a hundred dollars to obtain them. Tanners and Shoemakers, Painters and Blacksmiths, Tinners and Gunsmiths, Cabinet Makers, Barbers, and Bakers will find in their various Departments more than enough, in single recipes, to compensate them for the expense of the work; and Farriers and Farmers who deal in horses and cattle, will often find that Department to save a hundred times its cost in single cases of disease.</p>
<p>A gentleman recently called at my house for one of the books,
 
<pb n="ix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=15"/>
saying: "I have come ten miles out of my way to get it, for I staid over night with a farmer, who had one, and had been benefitted more than $20, in curing a horse by its directions." A gentleman near this city says he had paid out dollars after dollars to cure a horse of spavin, without benefit, as directed by <emph rend="italic">other</emph> books, of recipes; but a few shillings, as directed by <emph rend="italic">this,</emph> cured the horse. Another gentleman recently said to me: "Your Eye Water is worth more than $20." I could fill pages of similar statements which have come to my knowledge since I commenced the publication of this work, but must be content by asking all to look over our References, which have been voluntarily accumulating during the seven years in which the work has been in growing up to its present size and perfection; and the position in society, of most of the persons making these statements is such, many of which are entire strangers to the Author and to each other, that any person can see that no possible complicity could exist between us, even if we desired it.</p>
<p>Families will find in the Baking, Cooking, Coloring and Miscellaneous Departments, all they will need, without the aid of any other "Cook Book;" and the Washing-Fluid, which we have used at every washing except two for nearly eight years, is worth to every family of eight or ten persons, ten times the cost of the book, yearly, saving both in labor and wear of clothes.</p>
<p>SEVENTH.--Many of the articles can be gathered from garden, field or woods, and the others will always be found with Druggists, and most of the preparations will cost only from <emph rend="italic">one-half</emph> to as low as <emph rend="italic">one-sixteenth</emph> as much as to purchase them already made; and the only certainty, now-a-days, of having a good article, is to make it yourself.</p>
<p>FINALLY.--There is one or two things <emph rend="italic">fact</emph> about this book; It is the biggest humbug of the day; or it is the best work of the kind, published in the English language. If a careful perusal does not satisfy <emph rend="italic">all</emph> that it is <emph rend="italic">not the first,</emph> but that it <emph rend="italic">is the last,</emph> then will the Author be willing to acknowledge that Testing, Experimenting, Labor, Travel and Study, to be of no account in qualifying a man for such a work, especially when that work has been the long cherished object of his life, for a lasting benefit
 
<pb n="x" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=16"/>
to his fellow creatures, saving them from <emph rend="italic">extortion,</emph> in buying single recipes, and also giving them a reliable work, for every emergency, <emph rend="italic">more</emph> than for his own pecuniary benefit. Were it not so, I should have kept the work smaller as heretofore, for the eighth edition of two hundred and twenty four pages when handsomely bound sold for One Dollar, as now; but in this edition you get a Dollar's worth of <emph rend="italic">book,</emph> even if common reading matter, besides the most reliable <emph rend="italic">practical</emph> information, by which you will <emph rend="italic">often</emph> save, not only <emph rend="italic">dollars</emph> and <emph rend="italic">cents,</emph> but relieve <emph rend="italic">suffering</emph> and prolong <emph rend="italic">life.</emph> It is, in fact, a perfect mass of the most valuable methods of accomplishing the things spoken of, an Encyclopedia upon the various branches of Science and Art, treated of in the work, which no family can afford to do without; indeed, young and old, "Everybody's" book. And the "Taxes" nor "Times" should be, for a moment, argued against the purchase of so valuable a work, <emph rend="italic">especially when we assure you that the book is sold only by Traveling Agents, that all may have a chance to purchase; for if left at the Book Stores, or by Advertisement only, not One in Fifty would ever see it.</emph></p>
<p>Some persons object to buying a book of Recipes, as they are constantly receiving so many in the newspapers of the day; but if they had all that this book contains, scattered through a number of years of accumulated papers, it would be worth <emph rend="italic">more</emph> than the price of this work to have them gathered together, carefully arranged in their appropriate departments, with an alphabetical index, and handsomely bound; besides the advantage of their having passed under the Author's carefully <emph rend="italic">pruning</emph> and <emph rend="italic">grafting</emph> hand.</p>
<p>"To uproot error and do good should be the first and highest aspiration of every intelligent being. He who labors to promote the physical perfection of his race--he who strives to make mankind intelligent, healthy, and happy--cannot fail to have reflected on his own soul the benign smiles of those whom he has been the instrument of benefitting." The Author has received too many expressions of gratitude, thankfulness, and favor, in regard to the value of "Dr. Chase's Recipes; or Information for Everybody," to doubt in the least, the truth of the foregoing quotation; and trusts that the following quotation
 
<pb n="xi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=17"/>
may not be set down to "Egotism" or "Bigotry," when he gives it as the <emph rend="italic">governing</emph> reason for the continued and permanent publication of the work:</p>
<p size="smaller" align="indent1">"I live to <emph rend="italic">learn</emph> their story, who suffered for my sake;<lb/>To emulate their glory, and follow in their wake;<lb/>Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages, and noble of all ages,<lb/>Whose deeds crown History's pages, and Time's great volume make.</p>
<p size="smaller" align="indent1">"I live for those who love me, for those who know me true,<lb/>For the heaven that smiles above me, and awaits my spirit too;<lb/>For the cause that lacks assistance, for the wrong that needs resistance,<lb/>For the future in the distance, and the <emph rend="italic">good</emph> that I can do."</p>
<p>May these reasons <emph rend="italic">speedily</emph> become the governing principles throughout the world, especially with all those who have taken upon themselves the vows of our "Holy Religion;" <emph rend="italic">knowing</emph> that it is to those <emph rend="italic">only</emph> who begin to love God, and right actions, <emph rend="italic">here,</emph> with whom the glories of Heaven shall ever <emph rend="italic">begin.</emph> Were they thus heeded, we should no longer need corobating testimony to our statments. Now, however, we are obliged to array every point before the people, as a <emph rend="italic">Mirror,</emph> that they may judge <emph rend="italic">understandingly,</emph> even in matters of the most vital importance to themselves; consequently we must be excused for this lengthy Preface, Explanatory Index, and extended References following it. Yet, that there are some who will let the work go by them as one of the "Humbugs of the day," notwithstanding all that has or might be said, we have no doubt; but we beg to refer such to the statement amongst our References, of the Rev. C. P. Nash, of Muskegon, Mich., who, although he allowed it thus to pass him, could not rest satisfied when he saw the <emph rend="italic">reliability</emph> of the work purchased by his <emph rend="italic">less incredulous</emph> neighbors; then if you <emph rend="italic">will,</emph> let it go by; but it is hoped that all <emph rend="italic">purchasers</emph> may have sufficient confidence in the work not to allow it to lay idle; for, that the designed and greatest possible amount of good shall be accomplished by it, it is only necessary that it should be <emph rend="italic">generally introduced, and daily used,</emph> is the positive knowledge of the</p>

<p>The following statements are given by my <emph rend="italic">neighbors,</emph> to whom I had sent the eighth edition of my "Recipes," asking their opinions of its <emph rend="italic">value</emph> for the people, most of whom had previously purchased earlier editions of the work, and several of them used many of the Recipes; and surely their <emph rend="italic">position</emph> in society must place their statements above all suspicion of <emph rend="italic">complicity</emph> with the author in palming off a worthless book; but are designed to <emph rend="italic">benefit the people by increasing the spread of genuine practical information:</emph></p>
<p>Hon. ALPHEUS FELCH, one of our first lawyers, formerly a Senator in Congress, and also ex-Governor of Michigan, says:--Please accept my thanks for the copy of your "Recipes," which you were so good as to send me. The book seems to me to contain <emph rend="italic">much valuable practical information,</emph> and I have no doubt will be extensively useful.</p>
 
<pb n="xxvii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=33"/>
<p>A. WINCHELL, Professor of Geology, Zoology and Botany, in the University of Michigan, and also State Geologist, says:--I have examined a large number of Recipes in Dr. Chase's published collection, and from my knowledge, either experimental or theoretical, of many of them, and my confidence in Dr. Chase's carefulness, judgment, and conscientiousness in the selection of such only as are proved useful, after full trial, I feel no hesitation in saying that they may all be received with the utmost confidence in their practical value, except in those cases where the Doctor has himself qualified his recommendations.</p>
<p>JAMES C. WATSON, formerly Professor of Astronomy, and now Professor of Physics, in the University of Michigan, author of a "Treatise on Comets," also of "Other Worlds, or the Wonders of the Telescope," says:--I have examined your book of practical Recipes, and do not hesitate to say that so far as my observation and experience enable me to judge, it is a work which should find its way into every family in the land. The information which it contains could only have been collected by the most careful and long continued research, and is such as is required in every day life. I can heartily recommend your work to the patronage of the public.</p>
<p>REV. L. D. CHAPIN, Pastor of the Presbyterian Church, says: Allow me to express to you my gratification in the perusal of your book. I do not regard myself as qualified to speak in regard to the whole book, for you enter into Departments in which I have no special knowledge, but where I understand the subject I find many things of much practical value for every practical man and house-keeper; and judging of those parts which I do not, by those which I do understand, I think that you have furnished a book that most families can afford to have at any reasonable price.</p>
<p>REV. GEO. SMITH, Presiding Elder of the M. E. Church, Ann Arbor, says:--I take pleasure in saying that so far as I have examined, I have reason to believe that your Recipes are genuine, and <emph rend="italic">not</emph> intended as a <emph rend="italic">catch-penny,</emph> but think any person purchasing it will get the worth of their money.</p>
<p>REV. GEO. TAYLOR, Pastor of Ann Arbor and Dixboro M. E. Church, writes as follows:--As per your request, I have carefully examined your book of Recipes, recently issued, and take pleasure in adding my testimony to the many you have already received, that I regard it as the best compilation of Recipes I have ever seen. Several of these Recipes we have used in our family for years, and count each of them worth the cost of your book.</p>
<p>Elder SAMUEL CORNELIUS, Pastor of the Baptist Church, writes:--I have looked over your book of "Information for Everybody," and as you ask my judgment of it, I say that it gives evidence of much industry and care on the part of the compiler, and contains information which must be valuable to 
 
<pb n="xxviii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=34"/>
all classes of business men, in town and country, and especially to all families who want to cook well, and have pleasant, healthy drinks, syrups and jellies; who wish to keep health when they enjoy it, or seek for it in an economical way. I thank you for the copy you sent to me, and hope you may make a great many families healthy and happy.</p>
<p>REV. F. A. BLADES, of the M. E. Church, and Pastor in charge, for two years, of Ann Arbor Station, says: Dr. Chase--Dear Sir--Your work of Recipes, I have examined--and used some of them for a year past--I do not hesitate to pronounce it a valuable work--containing information for the Million. I hope you will succeed in circulating it very generally--it is worthy a place in every house.</p>
<p>This gentleman speaks in the highest terms of the "Dyspeptic's Biscuit and Coffee," as of other recipes used.</p>
<p>EBERBACH &#38; CO., Druggists, of Ann Arbor, say:--We have been filling prescriptions from "Dr. Chase's Recipes," for three or four years, and freely say that we do not know of any <emph rend="italic">dissatisfaction</emph> arising from want of correctness; but on the other hand, we know that they give <emph rend="italic">general</emph> satisfaction.</p>
<p>REV. S. P. HILDRETH, of Dresden, O., a former neighbor, inclosing a recent letter, says: I have carefully examined your book, and regard it as containing a large amount of Information which will be valuable in every household.</p>
<p>REV. WILLIAM C. WAY, of the M. E. Church, Plymouth, Mich., says:--I have cured myself of Laryngitis, (inflammation of the throat,) brought on by long continued and constant public speaking, by the use of Dr. Chase's black oil, and also know a fever sore to have been cured upon a lady, by the use of the same article.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">OPINIONS OF THE ANN ARBOR PRESS.</hd>
<p>A NEW BOOK.--Dr. Chase, of this city, has laid on our table a new edition of his work entitled "Dr. Chase's Recipes, or Information for Everybody," for making all sorts of things, money not excepted. We would not, however, convey the idea that the Doctor tells you how to make spurious coin, or counterfeit bills, but by practicing upon the maxims laid down in this work, money-making is the certain result. Buy a book, costing only one dollar, and adopt the recipes in your households, on your farms, and in your business, and success is sure to follow. The work is neatly printed, elegantly bound, and undoubtedly embodies more useful information than any work of the kind now before the public.</p>
<p>Students, or others, wishing to engage in selling a <emph rend="italic">saleable</emph> work, will do well to send for circulars describing the book, with terms to agents, &#38;c., for it is indeed a work which "Everybody" ought to have.--<emph rend="italic">Michigan State News, Ann Arbor.</emph></p>

<p>DR. A. W. CHASE, of this city, has placed on our table a copy of his "Recipes, or Information for Everybody." Beginning with a small pamphlet, the Doctor has swelled his work to a bound volume of about 400 pages; an evidence that his labors are appreciated. The volume furnishes many recipes and much information of real practical value.--<emph rend="italic">Michigan Argus, Ann Arbor.</emph></p>
<p>DR. CHASES'S RECIPES.--The ninth edition of Dr. Chase's Recipes has been recently published, revised, illustrated and enlarged,--comprising a very large collection of practical information for business men, mechanics, artists, farmers, and for families generally. The recipes are accompanied with explanations and comments which greatly increase the value of the work. It is a handsomely bound volume, sold for $1.--<emph rend="italic">Ann Arbor Journal.</emph></p>
<p>DR. CHASE, of Ann Arbor, has favored us with a copy of his book of recipes, which has, in an unprecedented short time, reached the ninth edition, showing its popularity wherever it has been introduced. It contains "information for everybody," for making all sorts of things. It is a valuable work for every one--many single recipes being worth much more than the cost of the book. Rev. Mr. Frazer, the gentlemanly agent for the work, is now in the city, and will call upon our citizens giving them an opportunity to secure a copy. The work is neatly printed, elegantly bound, and undoubtedly embodies more useful information than any work of the kind now before the public. One Dollar will buy it, and a better investment cannot be made by any one.--<emph rend="italic">Grand Rapids Eagle.</emph></p>
<lb/><lb/>
<p>DR. CHASE, of Ann Arbor, has favored us with a copy of Recipes which he has published, * * * * who claims that they have been made up from his own and others' every day experience. There are certainly a great many useful recipes in this work that might be found to richly repay its cost to any family.--<emph rend="italic">Michigan Farmer, Detroit.</emph></p>
<p>The following wholesale dealers of Detroit, and others with whom I have dealt for years, say:--We have been acquainted with Dr. A. W. Chase for several years in the Drug and Grocery business, and we are well satisfied that he would not do a business which he did not know was all right. His information in the form of recipes can be depended upon.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">OPINIONS OF THE PEOPLE--STRANGERS.</hd>
<p size="smaller">REV. C. P. NASH, of Muskegon, Mich.: writes Dr. Chase. Dear Sir: Some time since, one of your Agents canvassed our town for your "Book of Recipes," but thinking it, perhaps, one of the humbugs of the day, I neglected my opportunity to procure one. The books, however, were sold to our neighbors, about us; and my wife borrowed one in order to test a few of its Recipes; she found them all genuine, so far as she tried them; and now very much regrets that we did not procure one; she considers them invaluable. The object of this note is, to inquire whether you have the book for sale, and whether we can procure one by sending you the necessary funds. If so, we will send by return of mail, upon receipt of your answer. If not, can you,--and will be so kind as to,--inform us where, and how we can procure one?</p>
<p size="smaller">P. S.--Enclosed, please find a <emph rend="italic">directed and pre-paid</emph> envelope, for your reply</p>
<p size="smaller">FREDERICK BUES, Vinegar Manufacturer of Freeport, Ill., says: Dr. Chase's plan of making Vinegar is purely scientific, and I am making it with entire success.</p>
<p size="smaller">J. M. CHASE, Caneadea, N. Y., says: Your Vinegar is all right. More than forty men tasted it last Saturday, and they, to a man, say it is the best and pleasantest they ever saw.</p>
<p size="smaller">J. CLARK, of Conneautville, Pa., said to me he had made $500 in four months, from the Vinegar recipe.</p>
<p size="smaller">L. WEBER, Grocer, of Crestline, O., says, May 26, '59: I purchased Dr. Chase's Book about a year ago, and have made aad sold the Vinegar at a profit of about $40 on nine barrels. These statements refer to the "Vinegar in Three Days Without Drugs."</p>
<p size="smaller">H. W. LORD and B. FOX, Grocers of Pontiac, Mich., say: We have kept EGGS two years, by Dr. Chase's process, as good as when put down.</p>
<p size="smaller">L. HOWARD, Hotel Keeper, (of the firm of Kimball &#38; Howard,) Waverly House, Elgin, Ill., says: We used eggs in June of this year which were laid down in May of last year, by a plan just the same as Dr. Chase's, and they were just as good as fresh eggs, and as clean and nice in every way.</p>
<p size="smaller">WM. BUSS, of the firm of Robinson &#38; Co., Grocers, of Erie, Pa., says: I have tried a recipe similar to Dr. Chase's egg preserving recipe, for several years, with perfect success; and freely recommend it to any one wishing to deal in eggs.</p>
<p size="smaller">JOHN A. VANHORN, Merchant of Marshall, Mich., says: I have been acquainted with Dr. Chase's plan of keeping eggs for five years, and know that it will keep them as nice as fresh eggs.</p>
<p size="smaller">T. L. STEVENS, Merchant of Paw Paw, Mich., says: that he is acquainted with the same thing, and knows that it is good.</p>
<p size="smaller">CHAPEL &#38; GRAVES, Grocers at Ottawa, Ill., say, they paid $10 for the Egg Preserving recipe. I know two men, one of which paid $100, and the other $125 for a part only of the Vinegar recipes.</p>
<p size="smaller">HOWBRET &#38; FAILOR, Druggists of Bucyrus, Ohio, say: Dr. Chase's Red Ink is superior to Harrison's Columbian Ink, and also that his Burning Fluid can have no superior.</p>
<p size="smaller">MILLER &#38; DAVIS, Bankers, Ann Arbor, Mich., say: We have tried Dr. Chase's Common Ink, and find it a good article.</p>
<p size="smaller">ROBERT HEANY, Jr., Druggist of Hendrysburg, O., says: I have tried several of your recipes and so far find them good. The Eye-Water gives good satisfaction, the Good Samaritan takes the place of ALL OTHER Liniments in the shop; The Green Mountain Salve takes well for plasters, and Mead's Sovereign Ointment is doing for me what no other medicine has done, it is curing a sore on my back which has baffled all applications for more than two years: one doctor called it Tetter, another Erysipelas. It began like a Ring Worm and slowly spread with the most intolerable itching; it is now nearly well, with only two Weeks use of the ointment.</p>
<p size="smaller">DR. A. S. WITTER, Eclectic Physician, of Battle Creek, Mich., says: Either of Dr. Chase's preparations for the Ague is worth double what he asks for the whole list of recipes.</p>
<p size="smaller">Prof. A. H. PLATT, M. D of Antioch College, Yellow Springs, O., says: To the Medical Profession: This certifies, that the recipe in "Dr. Chase's Collection," for 
 
<pb n="xxxi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=37"/>
the cure of UTERINE HEMORRHAGE, is original with me, and has been used in my practice for nearly twenty years, without a single failure.</p>
<p size="smaller">L. S. HODGKINS, of Reading, Mich., says: I have cured my wife of Cancer of four years standing, with one of Dr. Chase's Cancer Cures. I know it has cured others also.</p>
<p size="smaller">W. J. COOK, M. D., of Mendota, Ill., says: I have examined Dr. Chase's recipes and find two or three worth more than he asks for the whole collection.</p>
<p size="smaller">T. W. CHURCH, Dentist, of Coldwater, Mich., says: I have been acquainted with Dr. Chase and his Book of Recipes for about two years; all I have tested are found to be practical; and his prescription for my father, in paralysis, was found to be more effectual in giving relief, than that of any other Physician.</p>
<p size="smaller">The Editor of the Ann Arbor Local News says: We have thoroughly examined the work qublished by A. W. Chase, M. D. entitled, "Dr. Chase's Recipes," and believe it to be a most valuable book for everybody. There is not in our opinion, a single recipe contained in it that is not of great practical use.</p>
<p size="smaller">N. S. REED, Harness Maker, of Mansfield, Ohio, says: I have used Dr. Chase's Varnish Blacking for Harness, over three years, and say it is the best I ever used.</p>
<p size="smaller">J. &#38; D. MINICH, Tanners, of Bucyrus, O., say: We are using Dr. Chase's tanning and finishing recipes with good satisfaction.</p>
<p size="smaller">MRS. MORRIS, of Lima, near Ann Arbor, Mich., says: I am using Dr. Chase's Washing Fluid, and have found it to be a very valuable recipe; and I would not do a washing without its aid for <emph rend="italic">half</emph> the price of the book, weekly.</p>
<p size="smaller">STEPHEN ALLEN, of Adrian, Mich., says: We have used A. W. Chase's Washing Fluid for two years, and my wife says she would not do without it for $10 a year, and it does not injure the clothes but saves all bleaching.</p>
<p size="smaller">JACOB SCHOEN, of East Saginaw, Mich., says: The recipe of Dr. Chase's Washing Fluid, is genuine and like the same which I manufactured and sold for nine years in Vienna, the capital of Austria in Europe.</p>
<p size="smaller">H. W. DONNELLY, Post Master of Parma, Mich., says: My family have used a preparation in washing for ten years, similar to Dr. Chase's; and we know it to be practical and valuable. He said to a farmer, who asked his opinion of the book, buy one, says he, that recipe alone is worth the WHOLE PRICE, a dozen times.</p>
<p size="smaller">"The editor of the Country Gentleman says of the Washing Fluid, from several years experience, that clothes not only wash easier, but look better, and last fully as long as when washed in the old way."</p>
<p size="smaller">THE AUTHOR knows that Shirts will last twice as long, for the board-rubbing wears them out faster than body wear, and as two-thirds of that rubbing is saved, the wear is of course saved.</p>
<p size="smaller">GIDEON HOWELL, of Oramel, N. Y., says: I have drank cider two years old (kept by one of Dr. Chase's recipes,) as good as when put up, and did not cost 1/4 of a cent per barrel to prepare it.</p>
<p size="smaller">SHELDON BEREE, a farmer of Cary, Ohio, says: I put away cider in November, by one of Dr. Chase's recipes to preserve cider, and it is now, in March, as good as when first made.</p>
<p size="smaller">MESSRS. J. W. BELL &#38; P. MOWER, Blacksmiths, of New Vienna, O., Aug. 11, '59, says: Dr. A. W. Chase, Dear Sir--We have tried your process for re-cutting Files and are happy to say to you that it works well, and we desire you also to send us the recipe for welding Cast-Steel without borax, which was forgotten, when we obtained the other. [I sold to them before these recipes were printed in the book.]</p>
<p size="smaller">JOHN MISER, Blacksmith, of Washington, Ohio, says: June 20, 1859, Dr. Chase tried his FILE CUTTING PROCESS in my shop last night, and I am satisfied that it is a good thing, and have purchased his book.</p>
<p size="smaller">WM. RUSSELL, Blacksmith of Princeton, Ind., says: May 7, '60, I purchased Dr. Chase's book of recipes this afternoon and have tested the recipe for tempering <implement>Mill picks</implement> to my perfect satisfaction, and also of the miller who used them. They cut glass also very nicely.</p>
<p size="smaller">J. KINNEMAN, Miller in Union Mills, Union, Pa., Says: Aug. 20, 1860, Mr. Todd a Blacksmith, of this place, put one dollar in my hands to be given to Dr. Chase
 
<pb n="xxxii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=38"/>
his <implement>Mill-pick</implement> Tempering Recipe gave satisfaction upon test, and the Doctor gained the money.</p>
<p size="smaller">G. C. SCHOFIELD, of Conneautville, Pa., says: After using Wood's Hair Restorative without benefit I have now a good head of hair from using a Restorative similar to Dr. Chase's, and I know his to be a superior article.</p>
<p size="smaller">O. B. BANGS, of Napoleon, Mich., says: Dr. Chase, Dear Sir: Allow me to say, by using your Hair Restorative once a day for two weeks gave me a beautiful dark head of hair in place of a silver-gray which had been my companion for years; and although I have not now used it in four months, yet my hair retains its beautiful dark appearance, and is soft and pliable as in youth; if it was used once a day for two weeks, and then two or three days only, every two months, no gray hair would ever appear. The expense of it is so very trifling, also, no one would feel it, as 3 1/2 pints costs only from 25 to 30 cents.</p>
<p size="smaller">T. SHAW, Cabinet Maker, of Westfield, N. Y., says: I have used Dr. Chase's preparation in finishing furniture, about five years, and know it is good, and better than any other thing I have used in 35 years.</p>
<p size="smaller">JONATHAN HIGGINS, Farmer, of West Union, Adams Co., O., says: I have used Dr. Chase's treatment for cholic in horses, for the last 12 to 15 years with perfect success, and also on myself with as perfect satisfaction; and my wife says she likes Mrs. Chase's Buckwheat Short-cake better than the griddle-cake, and it is not half the trouble to make it.</p>
<p size="smaller">A. FRENCH, of Jackson, O., says: Having cured many horses of Spavins and Bighead with a preparation similar to Dr. Chase's Ring-bone and Spavin cure, I am free to say that this recipe is worth more than the whole price of the book to all who are dealing in horses. It also cures curbs, callouses, inflammations, &#38;c., &#38;c., and this I know from 20 years experience in staging.</p>
<p size="smaller">J. M. LOWRY of Pomeroy, O., says: I have successfully treated more than 20 cases of bots, with Dr. Chase's remedy for that disease.</p>
<p size="smaller">W. W. ROBBINS, of Millwood, O., says: I purchased one of Dr. Chase's books; about 2 years ago, and have used a number of the recipes, and I find all I have tried give entire satisfaction; and I now want your last edition.</p>
<p size="smaller">E. L. BURTON, a glove manufacturer at Gloversville, N. Y., says: I have never known any preparation for removing paint from clothes equal to Dr. Chase's Renovating Mixture. From Experience.</p>
<p size="smaller">HIRAM SISSON, an old Farrier and Farmer of Crown Point, Essex Co., N. Y., says: I have used Dr. Chase's KITRIDGE and GREEN OINTMENTS, for several years, on Human Flesh and on Horses, in BRUISES and DEEP SORES with better success than any other preparation which I have ever used, and know they are no humbug, but are worthy of very great confidence.</p>
<p size="smaller">HIRAM STORMS, Dyer and Manufacturer, at Ann Arbor, Aug. 6, 1859, says: I have examined and revised Dr. Chase's Coloring Recipes, and am satisfied that they are practical and good. I have also furnished him with some valuable recipes in that line.</p>
<p size="smaller">"DR. CHASE'S RECIPES; OR, INFORMATION FOR EVERYBODY."--A work of 384 pages, now passing through our <implement>press,</implement> treating upon some Four Hundred different subjects,--over Eight Hundred Recipes--being interspersed with sufficient Wit and Wisdom to make it interesting as a general Reading Book, besides the fact that it embraces only such subjects as have a practical adaptability to "Everybody's" Every-Day Use, makes it certainly worthy of universal favor.

<chapter>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">MERCHANTS' AND GROCERS' DEPARTMENT.</hd>
<section class1="accompaniments">
<p>VINEGAR.--Merchants and Grocers who retail vinegar should always have it made under their own eye, if possible, from the fact that so many unprincipled men enter into its manufacture, as it affords such a large profit. And I would further remark, that there is hardly any article of domestic use, upon which the mass of the people have as little correct information as upon the subject of making vinegar. I shall be brief in my remarks upon the different points of the subject, yet I shall give all the knowledge necessary, that families, or those wishing to manufacture, may be able to have the best article, and at moderate figures. Remember this fact--that vinegar must have air as well as warmth, and especially is this necessary if you desire to make it in a short space of time. And if at any time it seems to be "Dying," as is usually called, add molasses, sugar, alcohol, or cider--whichever article you are making from, or prefer--for vinegar is an industrious fellow; he will either work or die, and when he begins to die you may know he has worked up all the material in his shop, and wants more. Remember this in all vinegars, and they will never die, if they have air. First, then, upon a small scale, for family use.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>TO MAKE IN THREE WEEKS.--<ingredient>Molasses</ingredient> 1 qt.; <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> 1 pt.; <ingredient>warm rain water</ingredient> 3 gals. Put all into a jug or keg, and tie a piece of gauze over the bung to keep out flies and let in air. In hot weather set it in the sun; in cold weather set it by the stove or in the chimney <ingredient>corner,</ingredient> and in three weeks you will have good <purpose>vinegar.</purpose></p>

up the jug in the same proportion as at first, and you will never have trouble for want of good vinegar.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>2. <attribution>A correspondent of the Dollar Newspaper</attribution> says: "The cheapest mode of making good vinegar is, to mix 5 qts. of <ingredient>warm rain water</ingredient> with 2 qts. of <ingredient>Orleans molasses,</ingredient> and 4 qts of <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> In a few weeks you will have the best <purpose>vinegar</purpose> you ever tasted." He might well say, "The best vinegar you ever tasted," for it would have double the necessary strength, and three or four times the strength of much that is sold; yet this strength would cost less to make, than to buy by the quart.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>3. IN BARRELS WITHOUT TROUBLE.--Merchants and Grocers, who retail <purpose>vinegar,</purpose> can always keep a good supply on hand by having about two or three barrels out of which to sell, by filling the first one they sell out, before quite empty, with</p>
<p><ingredient>Molasses</ingredient> 1 gal.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 11 gals.</p>
<p>Keeping this proportion to fill the barrel; the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and mother which is left in the barrel makes it work much quicker than if put into empty barrels; so pass around on the next barrel as it is nearly out, having three barrels, and unless you sell more than a barrel a week, you need never be out of vinegar. <variation>Some recommend to use <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> <ingredient>cream of tartar,</ingredient> &#38;c., in vinegar, but <emph rend="italic">I</emph> say, never.</variation> It is always advisable to have a hole in the top of the barrel, if standing on end; if on the side, the bung out and a gauze over it, to keep out flies and let air in.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>4. FROM <ingredient>SUGAR,</ingredient> <ingredient>DRIPPINGS FROM SUGAR HOGSHEADS,</ingredient> &#38;C.--Dealers who retail molasses, often have from five to fifty pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> left in the barrel after selling out the molasses. Each pound of this, or other <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> dissolved in two gallons of <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> makes that amount of good <purpose>vinegar</purpose> by either of the above plans. <ingredient>Rinsings of molasses barrels</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings of sugar hogsheads</ingredient> brought to this degree of sweetness, is as good for vinegar as any other material. <ingredient>Small beer, lager beer, ale, &#38;c., which have become sour,</ingredient> make good vinegar by reducing with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> <ingredient>small beer</ingredient> will need but little <ingredient>water;</ingredient> <ingredient>lager beer</ingredient> will need as much <ingredient>water</ingredient> as <ingredient>beer,</ingredient> or a little more; and <ingredient>ale,</ingredient> twice as much <ingredient>water</ingredient> as <ingredient>ale;</ingredient> they will all need <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> a quart or two to each barrel, unless put into barrels which have some <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient>
 
<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=41"/>
in them, and it will do no harm, but quicken the process in all cases if there is <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in the barrel.</p>

<p>5. FROM <ingredient>ACETIC ACID</ingredient> AND <ingredient>MOLASSES.</ingredient>--<ingredient>Acetic acid</ingredient> 4 lbs; <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 1 gal.; put them into a 40 gallon <implement>cask,</implement> and fill it up with <ingredient>rain water;</ingredient> shake it up and let stand from one to three weeks, and the result is good <purpose>vinegar.</purpose></p>
<p>If this does not make it as sharp as you like, add a little more <ingredient>molasses.</ingredient> But some will object to this because an acid is used: let me say to such, that acetic acid is <emph rend="italic">concentrated</emph> vinegar. Take 1 lb. or 1 pt. or any other quantity of this acid, and add seven times as much <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> and you have just as good vinegar as can be made from <emph rend="italic">cider,</emph> and that <emph rend="italic">instantaneously.</emph></p>
</recipe><recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>6. FROM <ingredient>APPLE CIDER.</ingredient>--As there are those who will not have any but <purpose>cider vinegar,</purpose> and have plenty of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> out of which to make it, I will give you the best plan of proceeding for manufacturers:</p>
<p>Have a room where it will not freeze; place on end as many barrels or large <implement>casks,</implement> <alt synonym1="without">witho ut</alt> heads, to hold as much as you wish to make; fill these one-third full of <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> and the other two-thirds with <ingredient>apple cider;</ingredient> <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> 2 qts. to each <implement>cask.</implement></p>
<p>In a few weeks you will have good vinegar; without the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> it would be all the season in becoming good. Then fill up into barrels for sale, leaving a little, say one-eighth, in the open barrels, and fill them up with <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>cider</ingredient> as before, and it will become good much quicker than before. If the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is objected to, use the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> without it, but pure <ingredient>cider</ingredient> makes vinegar too strong for any one to use, and requires much longer time in making. These barrels may have boards over them to keep out flies and dirt. If the retailer can give it his attention, by having a barrel of good cider vinegar to sell out of, he can always keep it up, if, when he draws out two or three gallons of the vinegar, he will go to his cider, kept for the purpose, and replace the vinegar with the cider; or if making with <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> or any other article, fill up with the same; but take notice, if you forget or neglect, and draw your vinegar nearly all out before you fill in, it does not keep to the point of sharpness desired, unless you have two or three barrels as mentioned in recipe No. 3.</p>

<p>Persons who have <ingredient>old sour cider</ingredient> on hand can in this way, or as mentioned in No. 6, have good vinegar from it immediately, as it comes around into vinegar much quicker than new cider.</p>

<p>7. IN THREE DAYS WITHOUT DRUGS.--The philosophy of making <purpose>vinegar</purpose> quickly, is this: The means that will expose the largest surface of the vinegar fluid, of a certain temperature, to the air, will convert it into vinegar in the shortest time; and as there is no way by which so great a surface can be exposed as by the shavings process, and at the same time control the temperature, that plan has been adopted, as explained in the wood cut accompanying, and in the descriptive note:</p>
<illustration><caption>Main cover, or loose boards,...............<lb/>Vinegar Fluid Space,.......................<lb/>False top, with tubes; and cords hanging through it,...........<lb/>Center portion of the tub, which should be filled with the shavings to within an an inch or two of the false top..................................<lb/>Holes to let in air,......<lb/>The square projections on the side of the Generator represent hoops.<lb/>VINEGAR GENERATOR.</caption><description>A cut-away illustration of a type of bucket, with holes in its sides and a small spout near the bottom. Captions to the left of the illustration label the parts of the object.</description></illustration>
<p><variation>DESCRIPTIVE NOTE.--Those wishing to manufacture, to sell at wholesale, will prepare a <ingredient>tub,</ingredient> or <ingredient>square box,</ingredient> and arrange it as shown in the accompanying cut, knowing that the taller and larger the tub, the quicker will the vinegar become good. The air holes are bored through every other, or every third stave, around the whole tub. These holes are to be about one foot or eighteen inches from the bottom; they must also be bored slanting down as you bore inward, othewise the <purpose><alt synonym1="vinegar generator">vinegar</alt></purpose> would run out and waste as it drips down the side of the tub. These tubs ought to be from ten to twenty feet high, according to the quantity you desire to run off daily. Now take <ingredient>beech, maple or 
 
<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=43"/>
basswood boards</ingredient>--and they are valuable in the order named--cut them off about eighteen inches in length, and plane thick, heavy <ingredient>shavings</ingredient> from the edges; and if they do not roll up and stay in nice rolls, you must roll and tie them up with small cord; or <ingredient>clean corn cobs</ingredient> will do, but they will only last one season, whilst the shavings will last several years. If cobs are used, they must be put in layers, each layer crossing the other, to prevent their packing too close. Then wet or soak them thoroughly in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and fill up the tub or tubs with them, until you are within two or three feet of the top, at which place you will nail a <implement>stout hoop</implement> around, upon the inside of the tub, which shall support the <emph rend="italic">false top,</emph> which has been made and fitted for that purpose, through which false top you will have bored good sized gimlet holes about every two inches all over its whole surface, through each of which holes a small <ingredient>cord,</ingredient> about four or five inches in length, is to be drawn, having a knot tied upon its upper end to keep it in its place, and to prevent the vinegar-fluid from working out too fast. The size of these holes, and the size of the cord, must be such as to allow the amount of vinegar being made to run through every twelve hours, or if time can be given to put it up so often, it may run through every six hours. You will cork all around between the false top and the tub with <ingredient>cotton,</ingredient> which causes the vinegar-fluid, hereafter to be described, to pass through the gimlet holes and drip from the ends of the small cords, evenly, all over the shavings, otherwise, if the false top was not exactly level, the vinegar-fluid would all run off at the lowest point, down the side of the tub, and be a very long time in becoming good, whilst if it drips slowly and all over and down through the shavings, it soon comes around into good vinegar. The holes bored for that purpose, in warm weather, oxidizes or acetifies the vinegar-fluid, by affording the <emph rend="italic">two</emph> essential points of quickly making good vinegar, that is, <emph rend="italic">air</emph> and <emph rend="italic">heat,</emph> without the expense of a fire to warm the fluid, or room in which the vinegar is made. Now bore five one-inch holes through the false top, one of them through the center, and the others two-thirds of the distance each way, towards the outside of the tub, into which holes drive as many <ingredient>pins,</ingredient> having a three-quarter inch hole bored through them lengthwise, which makes them tubes; cut the tubes off an inch below the top of the tub, so as to be out of the way of the main cover or loose boards which will be thrown over the top of the tub for the purpose of keeping out flies and dirt, and also to keep the <emph rend="italic">heated</emph> air in, which comes up through the tubes; this air becomes heated by the chemical action of the air upon the vinegar fluid as it drips along down through the shavings in the tub, becoming so hot that it would be uncomfortable to hold the hand therein. The space between the false top and the cover is called the vinegar fluid space, and it must be sufficiently tight in the joints of the tub, or box, to hold the fluid when put in.</variation> Now take a barrel of good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and pour it into the top or 
 
<pb n="38" id="chas044.gif."/>
the tub, and let it drip through the gimlet holes, from the cords, over the shavings, two or three times, each time putting in one gallon of <ingredient>highwines,</ingredient> or two or three gallons of <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> as the case may be, which sours the shavings and greatly helps the starting process of the vinegar-making. Without the addition to the strength of the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> as it runs through, it would part with nearly all of its own strength or acidity, to the shavings and thus lose its own life. If you have not, nor cannot obtain, <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> to start with, you must begin with <ingredient>weak vinegar-fluid,</ingredient> and keep adding to it every time through until it becomes very sour; then you will consider yourself ready to begin to make <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in double quick time, by using any of the fluids mentioned in the foregoing <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> recipes. But manufacturers generally use highwines thirty to forty per cent above proof, one gallon; <ingredient>water,</ingredient> eleven gallons; but persons living a great distance from market will find a cheaper plan by using <ingredient>ninety-eight per cent alcohol,</ingredient> one gallon; <ingredient>water,</ingredient> fifteen gallons; either of which make good <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> using <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> of course, with either article, from one pint to one quart to each barrel being made. Another tub or vat must be set in the ground, under the generator, or in a cellar, as the case may be, to hold as much <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> as the space between the false and real top will contain, or as much as you wish to make at one time; from which it is to be carried up in buckets, (or a wooden pump having a leather sucker is quicker and easier to raise it), to the top of the generator, until it becomes good <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> which it will do in the time mentioned at the head of this recipe, if passed through the generator by the faucet every twelve hours, which it must be; and if the tubs are fifteen or twenty feet high, it will only need passing through once, or <emph rend="italic">twice</emph> at most.</p>
<p><variation>Some will have no vinegar but that made from <ingredient>apple cider;</ingredient> then put in one-third <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and it makes vinegar as strong as anybody ought to use; but if they will have it at full strength, make it so, only it requires a little longer time to make.</variation></p>
<p><variation>If those who have <ingredient>cider</ingredient> which has been standing a long time, and does not become vinegar, will reduce it one-third with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and pass it through this machine, they will grind out first rate vinegar in one or two days' time. <ingredient>Sour beer</ingredient> or <ingredient>ale,</ingredient> the <ingredient>artificial cider,</ingredient> also, if it gets sour, make good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> when mixed with some other <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in making. <ingredient>Small beer,</ingredient> also <ingredient>drippings from sugar hogsheads</ingredient> in place of molasses, &#38;c. Nothing having <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> or <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> in it should be thrown away, as all will make good <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> which is as good as cash, and ought to be saved--if for no other purpose than to have the more to give the worthy poor.</variation></p>
 
<pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=45"/>
<p>It was at first thought to be absolutely necessary to make the vinegar-fluid of about seventy-five degrees of heat, and also to keep the room of the same temperature; but it has been found that by keeping the heat in the tub by the false top and the loose cover, that in warm weather it does very well without heating up the fluid, although it would make a little quicker with it; and if desired to make in cold weather, you must heat the fluid and keep the room warm also.</p>
<p>If families choose to try this plan, they can make all they will need in a keg not larger than a common <implement>churn,</implement> whilst wholesalers will use tubs as tall as their rooms will admit.</p>
<p>The first merchant to whom I sold this recipe, made all the vinegar he could retail by placing strips of board across the centre of a <implement>whisky barrel,</implement> which supported the shavings in the upper half only, allowing the vinegar to stand in the lower half; as his room was so low, he could only use the one barrel and a wash tub at the top instead of the false-top and space as represented in our cut; it took him only a week to make it in this way. I used the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> over a year. The strength of the fluid he used was good common <ingredient>whisky,</ingredient> one gal.; <ingredient>water,</ingredient> four gals. So it will be seen that all kinds of <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> or articles containing <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> can be made into vinegar.</p>
<p>REMARK--If you wish to make <emph rend="italic">sugar</emph> into vinegar, do not attempt to run it through the <emph rend="italic">generator,</emph> as it forms mother in that way, and soon fills up the little holes; but make it by standing in a barrel, as mentioned under that head, No. 4.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>8. QUICK PROCESS, BY STANDING UPON SHAVINGS.--Take 4 or 5 <implement>hogsheads</implement> or <implement>casks,</implement> and set them side by side, having a faucet near the bottom; then fill up the <implement>casks</implement> full of <ingredient>shavings</ingredient> prepared as in the foregoing recipe, or <ingredient>clean corn-cobs,</ingredient> putting some turning shavings over the top, after having put on an old coffee sack to keep the fine shavings from falling down among the coarse ones; this is to keep in the warmth; now sour the shavings with the best <purpose>vinegar,</purpose> by throwing it on the shavings and letting it stand half a day or so; then draw off by the faucet at the bottom, and throw it on again, adding 1 qt. of <ingredient>highwines</ingredient> to each barrel each time you draw it off, as the shavings absorb the acid, and the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> would become flat, but by adding the <ingredient>spirit</ingredient> the shavings become soured or acetified, and the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> gets better also. When the shavings are right, take highwines 30 or 40 per cent above proof 1 gal.; <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 1 qt.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 14 gals.; (<ingredient>river or well water</ingredient> will do, but not as good
 
<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=46"/>
for any <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient>) and put it upon the shavings, and draw off and put on again from one to three times daily, until sufficiently sour to barrel up.</p>
<p><attribution>Mr. Jackson, a Grocer, of Jackson, Michigan,</attribution> has been making in this way for several years. He uses also, <ingredient>sour ale,</ingredient> <ingredient>rinsings of sugar hogsheads,</ingredient> or the <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> and throws this fluid on the shavings, and draws off and returns from one to three times each day until sufficiently sour to barrel up, which only requires a few drawings; he then fills his barrels only two-thirds full, and leaves the bungs out summer and winter, and if he finds a barrel is getting weak in strength, he puts in a quart of highwines, which recruits the strength, or gives it work again, which, as I remarked before, if you give him stock to work on, and air, he labors--without both, he dies. <emph rend="italic">Bear this in mind,</emph> and your <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> will improve all the time, no matter how, or of what it is made. He fills the tubs only one-third or one-half full when making, does not heat, but uses <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and only works them in warm weather, and in winter fills the tubs with good <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and lets them stand over until spring, when they are ready for work again.</p>
<p>This man, with five <implement>casks</implement> thus managed, has sold over three hundred barrels of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in one season.</p>
</recipe>
<p>It might not be amiss, in closing this <emph rend="italic">long</emph> subject, to say that when you have no vinegar to begin with in <emph rend="italic">either</emph> of the processes, that if you commence with the fluid quite weak at first, it begins to sour quicker than if begun with at full strength, then as it begins to become sour, add more of the spirit, cider, sugar, or molasses, &#38;c., until you get the desired point of strength. So you might go on until a swallow of it would strangle a man to death, and remove every particle of skin from his throat.</p>

<p>It is a fact, also, that high or up-land makes better butter than when the cows are kept on rich bottom pasturage.

<p>The plan of preserving eggs has undoubtedly come from a patent secured by a gentleman in England in 1791, Jaynes, of Sheffield, Yorshire, which reads as follows:</p>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy" ethnicgroup="english">
<p>2. <purpose><alt synonym1="to preserve eggs">ENGLISH PATENTED METHOD.</alt></purpose>--"Put into a tub 1 bu. Winchester measure, of <ingredient>quick lime,</ingredient> (which is fresh <ingredient>slacked lime,</ingredient>) <ingredient>salt</ingredient> 32 oz.; <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> 8 oz. Use as much <ingredient>water</ingredient> as will give that consistency to the composition as will cause an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> to swim with its top just above the liquid. Then put and keep the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> therein, which will preserve them perfectly sound at least 2 years."</p>
</recipe>
<p>Persons who think it more safe can follow this English plan. I desire in all cases to give all the information I have on each subject. Consequently I give you the following also:</p>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p>3. <attribution>J. W. COOPER, M. D.'s,</attribution> <purpose>METHOD OF KEEPING AND SHIPPING GAME EGGS.</purpose>--" Dissolve some <ingredient>gum shellac</ingredient> in a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> to make a thin varnish, give each <ingredient>egg</ingredient> a coat, and after they become thoroughly dry, pack them in <ingredient>bran</ingredient> or <ingredient>saw dust,</ingredient> with their points downwards, in such a manner that they cannot shirt about. After you have kept them as long as you desire, wash the varnish carefully off, and they will be in the same state as they were before packing, ready for eating or hatching."</p>
<p>This would seem to be from good authority, as Dr. Cooper has been engaged for the last thirty years in raising nothing but the best game fowls, and he has frequently imported <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> He invariably directed them to be packed as above, and always had good success with them, notwithstanding the time and distance of the journey. He has also published a work upon <emph rend="italic">Game Fowls.</emph> His address is Media, Delaware Co., Pa.</p>
<p>This last plan would be a little more troublesome, but still would not be very much to prepare all that families would wish to use through the winter, or even for the retailer; as the convenience of having them in a condition to ship would be one inducement to use the last method, for with the first they must be taken out and packed in <ingredient>oats</ingredient> or something of that sort, to ship; with the last they are always ready; and weather permitting, about Christmas or New Year's, fresh and good <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in cities always command sufficient price to pay for all trouble and expense in the preservation and shipment.</p>

<p>THE SEX OF EGGS.--Mr. Genin lately addressed the Academy des Sciences, France, on the subject of the sex of eggs. He affirms that he is now able, after having studied the subject for upwards of three years, to state with assurance that the eggs containing the germ of males, have wrinkles on their smaller ends, while female eggs are smooth at the extremities.</p>
<p>While on the subject of eggs, you will excuse me for putting in a couple of items more which appropriately belong to other departments:</p>
<formula class="farmgarden">

The lady with whom I have stopped is a highly accomplished and intelligent housewife. She supports a "<unclear>hennery,</unclear>" and from her I derived my information in the matter. She told me that for many years she had been in the habit of administering to her hens, with their common food:</p>
<p>"<ingredient>Cayenne pepper,</ingredient> pulverized, at the rate of 1 tea-spoon each alternate day to 1 doz. fowls.</p>
<p>"Last season, when I was with her, each morning she brought in from twelve to fourteen eggs, having but sixteen hens in all. She again and again experimented in the matter by omitting to feed with the <ingredient>Cayenne</ingredient> for two or three days. The consequence invariably was that the product of eggs fell off five or six per day. The same effect of using the <ingredient>Cayenne</ingredient> is produced in winter as in summer."--<attribution rend="italic">Boston Transcript.</attribution></p>

<p><purpose>BURNING FLUID.--BEST IN USE.</purpose>--<ingredient>Alcohol, of 98 per cent,</ingredient> 9 pts.; good <ingredient>camphene</ingredient> 1 qt., or in these proportions. Shake
 
<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=51"/>
briskly, and it will at once become clear, when without the shaking it would take from 6 to 7 qts. of <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> to cut the camphene, while with the least it is the best.</p>
<p>These proportions make the best burning fluid which can be combined. Many put in <ingredient>camphor gum,</ingredient> <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> &#38;c., the first to improve its burning qualities, the last to prevent explosion, but they are perfectly useless for either, from the fact that <ingredient>camphor</ingredient> adds to the smoking properties, and nothing can prevent the gas arising from any fluid that will burn, from explosion, if the fire gets to it when it is confined. The only safety is in filling lamps in day-time, or far from fire or lights; and also to have lamps which are perfect in their construction, so that no gas may leak out along the tube, or at the top of the lamp; then let who will say he can sell you a recipe for non-explosive gas or fluid, you may set him down at once for a humbug, ignoramus, or knave. Yet you may set fire to this fluid, and if not confined it will not explode, but will continue to burn until all is consumed. Families cannot make fluid any cheaper than to buy it, as the profit charged on the <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> is usually more than that charged on fluid; but they will have a better article by this recipe than they can buy, unless it is made from the same, and it is best for any one, even the retailer, only to make small quantities at a time, and get the freshest camphene possible. When made in large quantities, even a barrel, unless sold out very soon, the last part is not as good as the first, owing to the separation of the camphene from the alcohol, unless frequently shaken, whilst being retailed out.</p>

<p>2. METHOD BY A SINGLE MULTIPLICATION.--RULE.--To find the interest on any given sum of money for any number of years, months or days. Reduce the years to months, add in the months if any, take one-third of the days and set to the right of the months, in decimal form, multiply this result by one-half the principal, and you have the interest required.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE.--The interest required on $1,400 for 2 years, 3 months, and 9 days:</p>
<p>Interest on $1,400 for 2 years, 3 months, and 9 days.</p>
<p align="center">&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 27.3<lb/>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 700<lb/>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ---------<lb/>Answer required, $191.10.0</p>
<p>The above example is at six per cent. Rule to obtain the interest at any other rate: For seven per cent increase the interest at six per cent by one-sixth, for eight per cent by one-third, for nine per cent by one-half, for ten per cent by two-thirds, for eleven per cent by five-sixths, for twelve per cent multiply by two. Twelve per cent is the highest rate of interest allowed by any State, except Minnesota, which, I believe, allows fifteen per cent.</p>

<section class1="generalnonfood">
<p>COUNTERFEIT MONEY.--SEVEN RULES FOR DETECTING.--FIRST--EXAMINE the form and features of all human figures on the notes. If the forms are graceful and features distinct, examine the drapery--see if the folds lie natural; and the hair of the head should be observed, and see if the fine strands can be seen. </p>
<p>SECOND.--Examine the lettering, the title of the bank, or the round handwriting on the face of the note. On all genuine bills, the work is done with great skill and perfectness, and there has never been a counterfeit but was defective in the lettering.</p>
<p>THIRD.--The imprint, or engraver's name. By observing the great perfection of the different comany names--in the evenness and shape of the fine letters, counterfeiters never get the imprint perfect. This rule alone, if strictly observed, will detect every counterfeit note in existence.</p>
 
<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=53"/>
<p>FOURTH.--The shading in the back-ground of the vignette, or over or around the letters forming the name of the bank, on a good bill is even and perfect, on a counterfeit is irregular and imperfect.</p>
<p>FIFTH.--Examine well the figures on the other parts of the note, containing the denomination, also the letters. Examine well the die work around the figures which stand for the denomination, to see if it is of the same character as that which forms the ornamental work surrounding it.</p>
<p>SIXTH.--Never take a bill that is deficient in any of the above points, and if your impression is bad when you first see it, you had better be careful how you become convinced to change your mind--whether your opinion is not altered as you become confused in looking into the texture of the workmanship of the bill.</p>
<p>SEVENTH.--Examine the name of the State, name of the bank, and name of the town where it is located. If it has been altered from a broken bank, the defects can plainly be seen, as the alteration will show that it has been stamped on.</p>

<p>REMARKS.--If saloon keepers, and grocers, who deal in wine, beer, cider, &#38;c., will follow our directions here, and make some of the following articles, they, and their customers, will be better pleased than by purchasing the spurious articles of the day; and families will find them equally applicable to their own use. And although <emph rend="italic">we start</emph> with an <emph rend="italic">artificial</emph> cider, yet it is as healthy, and is more properly a small beer, which it should be called, but from its close resemblance to cider, in taste, it has been so named.</p>

Make it in the evening and it will be fit for use the next day.</p>
<p>I make in a keg a few gallons at a time, leaving a few quarts to make into next time--not using <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> again until the keg needs rinsing. If it gets a little sour make more into it. In hot weather draw in a pitcher with ice; or if your sales are slow, bottle it and keep in a cool cellar according to the next recipe.</p>

<p>2. TO BOTTLE.--If it is desired <purpose>to bottle this artificial cider by manufacturers of small drinks,</purpose> you will proceed as follows:</p>

all well together; fill the barrel full, and let it work 24 to 48 hours, or until the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is done working out at the bung, by having put in a little <ingredient>sweetened water</ingredient> occasionally to keep the barrel full.</p>
<p>When it has worked clear, bottle it, putting in two or three broken <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> to each bottle, and it will nearly equal champagne. Let the bottles lay in a cool place on the side--(observe also this plan of laying the bottles upon the side, in putting away apple-cider or wine)--but if it is only for your own retail trade you can make as follows in the next recipe, and have it keep until a barrel is retailed.

<p>Stand in open <implement>casks</implement> or barrels, and put into each barrel about 1 pt. each of <ingredient>hickory,</ingredient> (if you have them, if not other <ingredient>hard wood</ingredient>), <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> and <ingredient>fresh slacked lime;</ingredient> stir the <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> and <ingredient>lime</ingredient> first into 1 qt. of <ingredient>new milk;</ingredient> then stir into the <ingredient>cider.</ingredient> It will cause all the pomace to rise to the surface, from which you can skim it as it rises, or you can let it remain about 10 hours, then draw off by a faucet near the bottom, through a strainer, to avoid the hardened pomace.</p>
<p>It is now ready for bottling, or barreling, if too much trouble to bottle. If you barrel it, it has been found essential to sulphur the barrel. The sulphuring is done by dipping <ingredient>cotton cloth</ingredient> into melted <ingredient>sulphur,</ingredient> and drying it; then cutting into strips about two by six inches. Put about three gallons of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> into the barrel; fire one end of the strip of the sulphured cloth, and introduce it into the bung-hole, and hold it by means of the bung, giving it air sufficient to let it burn, keeping the smoke in as it burns, when you will push the bung in tight and shake the barrel until the sulphur-gas is absorbed into the <ingredient>cider;</ingredient> then fill up the barrel with <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> and if not already in the cellar, place it there, and you have accomplished the two points first spoken of.

<p>In some parts of England, by using only ripe, sound apples, letting it work clear, racking off about twice, bottling, &#38;c., &#38;c., cider is kept from twenty to thirty years. When cider is drawn off and bottled, it should not be corked until the next day after filling the bottles, as many of them will burst. Then lay on the side.</p>

<p>5. ACTION OF SUGAR OR CANDY ON THE TEETH.--<attribution>M. Larez, of France,</attribution> in the course of his investigations on the teeth, has arrived at the following conclusions:</p>
<p>First--that "refined sugar, either from cane or beet, is injurious to healthy teeth, either by immediate contact with these organs, or by the gas developed, owing to its stoppage in the
 
<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=66"/>
stomach. Second--that if a tooth is macerated in a saturated solution of sugar, it is so much altered in the chemical composition that it becomes gelatinous, and its enamel opaque, spongy, and easily broken. This modification is due not to free acid, but to a tendency of sugar to combine with the calcareous basis of the teeth."</p>
<p>I have destroyed my own teeth, I have no doubt now, by constantly eating candies, while in the grocery business, before I knew its injurious effects, and I <emph rend="italic">believe</emph> it to have destroyed the <emph rend="italic">first</emph> teeth of all of my children which were born during my candy-eating propensities.

<p>9. <purpose>ALE, HOME-BREWED--HOW IT IS MADE.</purpose>--The following formula for the manufacture of a famous home-brewed ale of the English yeomanry, will convey a very clear idea of the components and mixture of ordinary ales. The middle classes of the English people usually make their ale in quantities of two barrels, that is, seventy-two gallons.</p>
<p>For this purpose a quarter of <ingredient>malt,</ingredient> (8 bus.) is obtained at the malt-house--or, if wished to be extra strong, nine bushels of malt--are taken, with <ingredient>hops,</ingredient> 12 lbs.; <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> 5 qts.</p>
<p>The malt, being crushed or ground, is mixed with 72 gals. of <ingredient>water</ingredient> at the temperature of 160&#176;, and covered up for 3 hours, when 40 gallons are drawn off, into which the <ingredient>hops</ingredient> are put, and left to infuse. Sixty gallons of <ingredient>water</ingredient> at a temperature of 170&#176; are then added to the malt in the <implement>mash-tub,</implement> and well
 
<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=70"/>
mixed, and after standing 2 hours, sixty gallons are drawn off. The <ingredient>wort</ingredient> from these two mashes is boiled with the <ingredient>hops</ingredient> for 2 hours, and after being cooled down to 65&#176;, is strained through a <implement>flannel</implement> bag into a fermenting tub, where it is mixed with the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> and left to work for 24 or 30 hours. It is then run into barrels to cleanse, a few gallons being reserved for filling up the <implement>casks</implement> as the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> works over.</p>
<p>Of course when the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is worked out it must be bunged. If one-half a pint of this was taken each meal by men, and half that amount by females, and no other spirits, tea nor coffee, during the day, I hesitate not in saying that I firmly believe it would conduce to health. I know that this, which a man makes himself, or some of the wines mentioned in this work, home-made, are all that any person ought to allow themselves to use in these days when <emph rend="italic">dollars and cents</emph> are the governing influences of <emph rend="italic">all</emph> who deal in <emph rend="italic">such</emph> articles.</p>

<p>"The removal of the small fruit on the ends of the branches is no loss, for the lower fruit will swell to an unnatural size by trimming, and both a greater weight and measure of fruit will be the consequence, besides obtaining a large portion five to fifteen days earlier. The trimming should be done so as to have a few leaves beyond the fruit, to insure perfect ripening. The importance of early manuring is too evident to need comment. The burying of the removed leaves immediately around the plant is a good practice, both by insuring full disturbance of the soil, and by the presenting of a fertilizer progressed precisely to the point of fruit making. The portions buried decay rapidly, and are rapidly assimilated." If wanted very early and large, trim off all except two or three upon each plant.</p>

<p>He did not think of it until after the frosts, when observing them going to waste, he thought to see if she would eat them, which she did freely, from the commencement. I have also known pigs to eat them, but this is not common. In 1862, I found my cow to eat them as freely as spoken of by Mr. Davis.</p>

root,</ingredient> bruised, 1 oz.; <ingredient>cayenne</ingredient> 5 grs.; <ingredient>tartaric acid</ingredient> 1 dr.; let stand 1 week and filter, or draw off by faucet above the sediment. Now add 1 gal. of <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which 1 lb. of <ingredient>crushed sugar</ingredient> has been boiled. Mix when cold. To make the color, boil 1/2 oz. of <ingredient>cochineal,</ingredient> 3/4 oz. of <ingredient>cream of tartar,</ingredient> 1/2 oz. of <ingredient>saleratus,</ingredient> and 1/2 oz. of <ingredient>alum</ingredient> in 1 pt. of <ingredient>water</ingredient> until you get a bright red color, and use a proper amount of this to bring the wine to the desired color.</p>
<p>This wine is suitable for nearly all the purposes for which any wine is used, and a gallon of it will not cost more than a pint of many wines sold throughout the country for medicinal purposes, represented to be imported from Europe. Let a man, suffering with a bad cold, drink about half a pint of this wine hot, on going to bed, soaking his feet at the same time in hot water fifteen or twenty minutes, and covering up warm and sweating it out until morning, then washing off his whole body with cool or cold water, by means of a wet towel, and rubbing briskly with a coarse dry towel for four or five minutes, will not be able to find his cold or any bad effects of it in one case out of a hundred. Ladies or children would take less in proportion to age and strength. Females in a weakly condition, with little or no appetite, and spare in flesh, from food not properly digesting, but not yet ripened into actual <emph rend="italic">indigestion,</emph> will find almost entire relief by taking half a wine-glass of this wine twenty minutes before meals, and following it up a month or two, according to their improved condition.

<p>14. <purpose>CIDER WINE.</purpose>--<attribution>Prof. Horsford,</attribution> a celebrated chemist, communicated the following recipe to the Horticultural Society of Massachusetts, and recommends it for general trial:</p>
<p>"Let the new <ingredient>cider from sour apples,</ingredient> (ripe, sound <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> preferred,) ferment from 1 to 3 weeks, as the weather is warm or cool. When it has attained to a lively fermentation, add to each gallon, according to its acidity, from 1/2 a lb. to 2 lbs. of <ingredient>white crushed sugar,</ingredient> and let the whole ferment until it possesses precisely the taste which it is desired should be permanent. In this condition pour out a quart of the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> and add for each gallon 1/4 oz. of <ingredient rend="italic">sulphite of lime,</ingredient> not sulphate. Stir the powder and <ingredient>cider</ingredient> until intimately mixed, and return the emulsion to the fermenting liquid. Agitate briskly and thoroughly for a few moments, and then let the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> settle. Fermentation will cease at once.
 
<pb n="73" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=79"/>
When, after a few days, the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> has become clear, draw off carefully, to avoid the sediment, and bottle. If loosely corked, which is better, it will become a sparkling cider wine, and may be kept indefinitely long.</p>
<p>This has been tried with varied success; those who do not think it too much to follow the directions, obtain a good article, but others, supposing it to do just as well without sugar, or drawing off, or bottling, have found but little satisfaction--they have no reason to expect any; and yet they might be well satisfied to obtain a good wine from the orchard, even with <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the above requisitions.</p>

<p>15. <purpose>GRAPE WINE.</purpose>--"Ripe, freshly picked, and selected, tame <ingredient>grapes,</ingredient> 20 lbs.; put them into a stone jar and pour over them 6 qts. of <ingredient>boiling soft water;</ingredient> when sufficiently cool to allow it, you will squeeze them thoroughly with the hand; after which allow them to stand 3 days on the pomace with a cloth thrown over the jar, then squeeze out the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> and add 10 lbs. of nice <ingredient>crushed sugar,</ingredient> and let it remain a week longer in the jar; then take off the scum, strain and bottle, leaving a vent, until done fermenting, when strain again and bottle tight, and lay the bottles on the side in a cool place."</p>
<p>This wine is the same as used by the <attribution>Rev. Orrin Whitmore, of Saline, Mich.,</attribution> for sacramental purposes. I have tasted it myself, and would prefer it for medicinal uses to nine-tenths of the wines sold in this country. With age, it is nice. I am of the opinion that it might just as well remain in the jar until it is desired to bottle, and thus save the trouble of the extra straining. For I have now wine, four years old in my cellar, made in Evansville, Ind., from the grape, which was made without the addition of any particle of matter whatever. Simply, the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> pressed out, hauled in from the vinery, put into very large <implement>casks</implement> in a cool cellar, not even racked off again under one year from the time of making.

I am told by other wine makers also, that if care is observed when the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> is pressed out to keep clear of the pomace, that wine is better to stand without racking or straining, and that nothing is found in the barrels, after the first year, save the crude tartar or wine-stone, as some call it, which all grape wine <alt synonym1="deposits">deposites</alt> on the sides of the <implement>cask.</implement> These wines are every way appropriate for sacramental and medicinal

<p>Whenever you buy an article of medicine which is not regularly <emph rend="italic">labeled</emph> by the Druggist, have him, in all cases, <emph rend="italic">write</emph> the name upon it.

<p>ALCOHOL--IN MEDICINES, PREFERABLE TO BRANDY, RUM, OR GIN, OF THE PRESENT DAY.--There is no one thing doing so much to bolster up the tottering yet strong tower of Intemperance, as the old Fogy Physicians, who are constantly prescribing these articles to their patients,
 
<pb n="76" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=82"/>
and one-half of the reason for it is to cover the faults of their own constant use of these beverages. This unnecessary call for these articles thus used as a medicine, keeps up a large demand; and when we take into consideration the almost impossibility of obtaining a genuine article, the sin of prescribing them becomes so much the greater, when it is also known by all really scientific men that with alcohol (which is pure) and the native fruit wines, cider, and cider wines, (which every one can make for themselves, and can thus know their purity,) that all the indications desired to be fulfilled in curing disease can be accomplished without their use.</p>
<recipe class1="beverages" class2="medhealth" alcoholic="yes">
<p>Then, when it is deemed advisable <purpose>to use spirits to preserve any bitters or syrups from souring,</purpose> instead of 1 qt. of brandy, rum or gin, use the best <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> 1/2 pt., with about 2 or 3 ozs. of <ingredient>crushed sugar</ingredient> for this amount, increasing or lessening according to the amount desired in these proportions. <variation>If a <purpose rend="italic">diuretic</purpose> effect is desired, which is calculated to arise where gin is prescribed, put 1 dr. of <ingredient>oil of juniper</ingredient> into the <alt synonym1="alcohol">acohol</alt> before reducing with the <ingredient>water;</ingredient> or if the preparation admits of it you may put in from 1 to 2 ozs. of <ingredient>juniper berries</ingredient> instead of the oil.</variation> <variation>If the <purpose rend="italic">astringent</purpose> effect is desired, as from brandy, use, say, 1/4 oz. of <ingredient>gum kino</ingredient> or <ingredient>catechu,</ingredient> either, or a half of each may be used.</variation> <variation>If the <purpose><emph rend="italic">sweating</emph> or opening properties</purpose> are required, as indicated by the prescription of rum, sweeten with <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> in place of the sugar, and use 1 dr. of <ingredient>oil of carraway,</ingredient> or 1 to 2 ozs. of the <ingredient>seed</ingredient> for the above amount, as the juniper berries for gin.</variation></p>
<p>If the strength of wine only is desired, use 1 qt. of the <ingredient>ginger wine,</ingredient> or if that flavor is not fancied, use any other of the wines as preferred by the patient.</p>
<p>But no one should use any of the descriptions of alcohol as a constant beverage, even in medicine, unless advised to do so by a physician <emph rend="italic">who is not himself a toper.</emph></p>
</recipe>
<p>If families will follow the directions above given, and use proper care in making some of the various fruit wines as given in this book for medical use, preparing cider, &#38;c., which is often used in prescriptions, they would seldom, if ever, be obliged to call for the <emph rend="italic">pretended</emph> pure brandies, rums, gins, &#38;c., of commerce, and intemperance would die a natural death for want of support.</p>
<p>And you will please allow me here to correct a common error, with regard to the presence of alcohol in wines. It is generally supposed that wine made from fruit, without putting some kind of spirits into it, does not contain any
 
<pb n="77" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=83"/>
alcohol; but a greater mistake does not exist in the world. Any fruit, the juice of which will not pass into the vinous fermentation by which alcohol is produced, will not make wine at all; distillation will produce brandy or alcohol from any of these fermented liquors.</p>
<p>There is no wine, of any note, containing less than 10 parts of alcohol to 100 parts of the wine; and from that amount up to 25 1/2 parts; currant 20 1/2; gooseberry 11 3/4; cider from 5 to 9 parts; porter 4 1/2; even small beer 1 1/4 parts of qts. to 100 qts..</p>
<p>So it will be seen that every quart of fruit wine not made for medicine, or sacramental purposes, helps to build up the cause (intemperance) which we all so much desire not to encourage. And for those who take any kind of spirits for the <emph rend="italic">sake</emph> of the spirit, let me give you the following:</p>

ALSO VALUABLE IN DIARRHEA, SUMMER-COMPLAINT, CHOLERA-INFANTUM, AND ALL FORMS OF FEVER IN CHILDREN.--The symptoms of Fever are generally understood, yet I will give the characteristic features by which it will always be detected: cold chills, followed by

a hot skin; a quickened pulse, with a weak and languid feeling of distress; also, loss of appetite, thirst, restlessness, scanty excretions; in fact, every function of the body is more or less deranged. Of course, then, that which will restore all the different machinery to healthy action, will restore health. That is what the following febrifuge has done in hundreds of cases--so attested to by "Old Doctor Cone," from whose work on "Fevers and Febrile Diseases," I first obtained the outlines of the treatment, and it gives me pleasure to acknowledge my indebtedness to him through fourteen years of neighborhood acquaintance, always finding him as willing to communicate, as qualified to practice, and daring, in breaking away from "Medical Soceity Rules," to accomplish good.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose>FEBRIFUGE FOR FEVERS IN GENERAL.</purpose>--Carbonate of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> 2 drs.; <ingredient>alum</ingredient> 1 dr.; <ingredient>capsicum,</ingredient> foreign gentian, colombo root, and Prussiate of iron, all pulverized, of each, 1/2 dr.; mix, by putting into a bottle, adding <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> 4 ozs. DOSE--One tea-spoon to a grown person, every 2 hours, in common cases of fever. It may be sweetened if preferred. Shake well each time before giving, and keep the bottle tightly corked.</p>
<p>The philosophy of this treatment is, the carbonate of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> neutralizes the acidity of the stomach, and determines to, and relaxes the surface; and with the <ingredient>capsicum</ingredient> is a hundred per cent more efficient. The <ingredient>alum</ingredient> constringes, soothes, and aids in relieving the irritated and engorged mucous membrane of the stomach, and finally operates as a gentle laxative. The colombo and gentian are gently astringent and stimulating, but chiefly tonic, and the Prussiate of iron is tonic; and in their combination are, (as experience will and has proved) the most efficient and safe Febrifuge, in all forms and grades of fever, yet known. We therefore wish to state that, after twenty-five years' experience in the treatment of disease, we have not been able to obtain a knowledge of any course of treatment that will begin to compare with that given above, for the certain, speedy, and effectual cure of all forms of fever; and all that is requisite, is, to have sufficient confidence in the course of treatment recommended; to use it from three to five, and in extreme cases, seven days, as directed, and that confidence will be inspired in all who use it, whether Physician (if unprejudiced) or

patient, or the <ingredient>heads</ingredient> of families; remember all processes in nature require time for their accomplishment.</p>
<p>After the patient has been twenty-four hours without fever, or if the patient be pale, blanched, with a cool surface and feeble pulse, at the commencement of fever, prepare the following:</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>2. <purpose><alt synonym1="fever">FEBRIFUGE TEA.</alt></purpose>--Take <ingredient>Virginia snake root</ingredient> and <ingredient>valerian root,</ingredient> of each 2 drs.; <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> 1 pt. Pour the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> on the roots and steep 1/2 an hour, and give a tea-spoon of the <ingredient>Febrifuge</ingredient> and a table-spoon of this <ingredient>Tea</ingredient> together, every 2 hours, and after he has been another 24 hours without fever, give it every 3 or 4 hours, until the patient has good appetite and digestion, then 3 times daily, just before meals, until the patient has gained considerable strength, when it may be entirely discontinued; or he may continue the simple infusion to aid digestion.</p>
<p><variation>A strong <ingredient>tea of wild cherry bark</ingredient> makes the best substitute for the snake root <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> and especially if mercury has been previously used in the case, and if it has, it is best to continue the <ingredient>cherry bark tea</ingredient> until the patient is entirely recovered.</variation></p>
<p>A patient using this treatment, if bilious, may vomit bile a few times, or if there is conjestion of the stomach, he will probably vomit occasionally for a few hours, but it will soon subside. It will not purge, except a patient be very bilious, in which case there will probably be two or three bilious discharges; but it gives so much tone to the action of the stomach and bowels as to secure regular operations; but if the bowels should not be moved in two or three days, give injections of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> or <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in it.</p>
<p>Give the patient all the plain, wholesome diet, of any kind, he will take, especially <ingredient>broiled ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>mush</ingredient> and <ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>boiled rice,</ingredient> <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>dry toast,</ingredient> hot mealy <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> boiled or roasted, with good fresh <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> &#38;c., &#38;c.; and good, pure, <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> or <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> seasoned to the taste, as drinks, and keep the person and bed clean, and room quiet and undisturbed by conversation, or any other noise, and see that it is well ventilated.</p>
<p>If there should be extreme pain in the head when the fever is at the highest, or in the back or loins, and delirium at night, with intolerance of light and noise; in such cases,

in addition to keeping the room cool, dark and quiet, and giving the febrifuge regularly, as above directed, take the following:</p>

<formula class="medhealth">
<p>3. <purpose>FEVER LINIMENT.</purpose>--<ingredient>Sulphuric</ingredient> ether and <ingredient>aqua ammonia,</ingredient> of each 1 oz.; muriate of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> 1/8 oz.; mix, and shake the bottle, and wet the scalp and all painful parts, every 2 or 3 hours, until the pain abates. Keep tightly corked.</p>
<p>After the application of the liniment, fold a muslin cloth four or five thicknesses, dip it in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and apply it to the head or any part afflicted with severe pain; or to the pit of the stomach, if there be much vomiting; and it may be renewed every three or four hours.</p>
<p>Besides the above treatment, dip a towel in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and rub the patient off briskly and thoroughly, and be careful to wipe perfectly dry, with a clean, hot and dry towel; this may be repeated every three or four hours, if the skin be very hot and dry; but if the surface be pale, cool, moist, livid, or lead-colored, omit the general sponging; but the face, neck and hands may be washed occasionally, but be sure to wipe perfectly dry with a clean, hot and dry towel. But if he be very pale and blanched, with a cool or cold surface, or have a white circle around his mouth and nose, or be covered with a cold, clammy perspiration, give the Febrifuge every hour, until the above symptoms disappear, giving the patient hot <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> or <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> <ingredient>pennyroyal,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> <ingredient>balm,</ingredient> or <ingredient>mint tea,</ingredient> as hot as he can sup them, and as freely as possible, and make hot applications to his person, and put a bottle of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to the soles of his feet; and after this tendency to prostration is overcome, then give the Febrifuge once in two hours as before only.</p>
<p>Children will use the medicine in all respects as directed for grown persons, giving to a child one year old a fourth of a tea-spoon, or fifteen drops; if under a year old, a little less, (we have frequently arrested Cholera Infantum with the Febrifuge, in children under six months old, and in some instances under a month old,) and increase the dose in proportion to the age above a year old, giving half a tea-spoon to a child from three to six, and three-fourths of a tea-spoon from six to ten years, old and so on; and be sure to offer children some food several times a day, the best of which is broiled <ingredient>smoked ham,</ingredient> good <ingredient>stale wheat bread</ingredient> boiled in good

<ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>mush</ingredient> and <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>boiled rice,</ingredient> etc.; but animal diet agrees best, and especially in cases of Summer Complaint, or Cholera Infantum, the diet had better be almost exclusively animal. It will be difficult to use the infusion of snake root with children that are too young to obey the mandate of parents, and the Febrifuge may be made sweet, with <ingredient>white or loaf sugar,</ingredient> for young children, so as to cover its taste as much as possible, but older children will be benefited very much by the use of the infusion of <ingredient>snake root</ingredient> and <ingredient>valerian,</ingredient> and should take it as prescribed for adults, of course adapting the dose to the age of the patient.</p>

<p>NOTE.--We do not believe that one case of fever in a thousand will develope Typhoid symptoms, unless such cases have been injured in the treatment of the first stage, by a reducing course of medicine, as bleeding, vomiting, especially emetic tartar, purging, especially with <ingredient>calomel,</ingredient> and <ingredient>compound extract</ingredient> of <ingredient>colocynth,</ingredient> or <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> salts, or <ingredient>infusion of senna,</ingredient> and the common <ingredient>cooling powder,</ingredient> which is composed of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> or <ingredient>nitre,</ingredient> and <ingredient>tartar emetic</ingredient> or <ingredient>ipecac,</ingredient> all of which irritate the mucous membrane of the

<p>DYSPEPSIA.--In the good old days of corn bread and 
 
<pb n="88" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=94"/>
crust coffee, there was but little trouble with Dyspepsia; but since the days of fashionable intemperance, both in eating and drinking, such as spirituous liquors, wines, beers, ale, tea, and coffee, hot bread or biscuit, high seasoned food, over-loading the stomach at meals, and constant eating and drinking between meals, bolting the food, as called, that is, swallowing it without properly chewing, excessive venery, want of out door exercise, with great anxiety of mind as to how the means can be made to continue the same indulgences, &#38;c., all have a tendency to debilitate the stomach, and bring on, or cause, Dyspepsia.</p>
<p>And it would seem to the Author that the simple statement of its cause--the truth of which no one can reasonably doubt--would be sufficient to, at least, suggest its cure. But I am willing to state, that, as a general thing, this over-indulgence would not be continued, nor would it have been allowed, had they <emph rend="italic">known</emph> its awful consequences. I know that this was true in my own case, in all its points; this was, of course, before I had studied, or knew but little, of the power of the human system, or the practice of medicine, and it was for the purpose of finding something to cure myself, that I commenced its study; for it was by years of over-indulgence at table, and between meals, in the grocery business which I was carrying on, that I brought on such a condition of the stomach that eating gave me the most intolerable suffering--a feeling almost impossible to describe; first a feeling of goneness or want of support at the stomach, heat, lassitude, and finally pain, until a thousand deaths would have been a great relief; drink was craved, and the more I drank the more intolerable the suffering--<ingredient>apple cider,</ingredient> <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> made palatable with sugar, excepted. It might be asked at this point, what did I do? I would ask, what could I do? Eat, I could not, drink I could not; then what else was to be done, only, to do without either. What, starve? No.</p>
<p>TREATMENT.--Take,--no, just stop taking. "Throw all medicine to the dogs"--yes, and food also. What, starve? No, but simply get <emph rend="italic">hungry;</emph> whoever heard of a dyspeptic being hungry? at least, those who eat three meals a day. They eat because the victuals <emph rend="italic">taste</emph> good--mouth-hunger, only.</p>
 
<pb n="89" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=95"/>
<p>The last year or two of my dyspeptic life, I only ate because it was eating time, and supposed I must eat or die, when I only died forty deaths, by eating.</p>
<p>All physicians whose books I have read, and all whose prescriptions I have obtained, say: "Eat little and often; drink little and often." I say eat a little, and at the right time, that is, when hungry at the stomach; drink a little, and at the right time, that is, after digestion, and it is of just as much importance to eat and drink the right thing, as at the right time.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>Persons have been so low in <purpose>Dyspepsia,</purpose>that even one tea-spoon of food on the stomach would not rest; in such cases, let nothing be taken by mouth for several days; but inject gruel, <ingredient>rice water,</ingredient> <ingredient>rich broths,</ingredient> &#38;c.; but these cases occur very seldom.</p>
<p>FIRST.--Then, with ordinary cases, if there is much heat of the stomach, at bed time, wet a towel in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> wringing it out that it may not drip, and lay it over the stomach, having a piece of <implement>flannel</implement> over it to prevent wetting the clothes. This will soon allay the heat, but keep it on during the night, and at any subsequent time, as may be needed.</p>
<p>SECOND.--In the morning, if you have been in the habit of eating about two large <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> two pieces of <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> two slices of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or from four to six hot <ingredient>pancakes,</ingredient> or two to four hot <ingredient>biscuits,</ingredient> and drinking one to three cups of <ingredient>tea or coffee,</ingredient>--hold, hold, you cry; no, let me go on. I have many times seen all these eaten, with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> or <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> too large in amount to be mentioned, with a taste of every other thing on the table, such as <ingredient>cucumbers,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> &#38;c., &#38;c., and all by dyspeptics; but,</p>
<p>You will stop this morning on half of one <ingredient>potato,</ingredient> two inches square of <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> and half of one slice of cold, <ingredient>wheat bread</ingredient>--or I prefer, if it will agree with you, that you use the <ingredient>"Yankee Brown Bread,</ingredient>" only the same quantity; <emph rend="italic">eat very slow, chew perfectly fine, and swallow it without <ingredient>water,</ingredient> <ingredient>tea, or coffee;</ingredient></emph> neither must you drink any, not a drop, until one hour before meal-time again, then as little as possible, so as you think not quite to choke to death.</p>
<p>THIRD.--The question now to be settled is, did you <emph rend="italic">suffer</emph> from the <emph rend="italic">abundance</emph> of your breakfast, or from the <emph rend="italic">kind</emph> of
 
<pb n="90" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=96"/>
food taken? If you did, take <emph rend="italic">less</emph> next time, or change the <emph rend="italic">kind,</emph> and so continue to lessen the <emph rend="italic">quantity,</emph> or change the <emph rend="italic">kind</emph> until you ascertain the proper quantity and kind, which enables you to overcome this exceeding suffering after meals; nay, more, which leaves you perfectly <emph rend="italic">comfortable</emph> after meals.</p>
<p>LASTLY--You now have the whole secret of curing the worst case of dyspepsia in the world You will, however, bear in mind that <emph rend="italic">years</emph> have been spent in indulgence; do not therefore expect to cure it in <emph rend="italic">days,</emph> nay, it will take <emph rend="italic">months,</emph> possibly a whole <emph rend="italic">year</emph> of self-denial, watchfulness and care: and even then, one over loading of the stomach at a Christmas pudding will set you back again for months. Make up your mind to eat only <emph rend="italic">simple</emph> food, and that, in <emph rend="italic">small</emph> quantities, notwithstanding an over-anxious wife, or other friend, will say, now do try a little of this <emph rend="italic">nice</emph> pie, pudding, or other dish, no matter what it may be. Oh! now do have a cup of this nice <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> they will often ask; but <emph rend="italic">no,</emph> NO, must be the invariable answer, or you are again a "goner." For there is hardly any disease equally liable to relapse as dyspepsia; and indulgence in a variety of food, or over-eating any one kind, or even watery vegetables or fruit, will be almost certain to make the patient pay dear for the whistle.</p>
<p>Then you must eat <emph rend="italic">only</emph> such food ar you know to agree with you, and in just as <emph rend="italic">small</emph> quantities as will keep you in health. Drink no fluids until digestion is over, or about four hours after eating, until the stomach has become a little strong, or toned up to bear it, then one cup of the "Dyspepsia Coffee," or one cup of the "Coffee Made Healthy," may be used. But more difficulty is experienced from over-drinking, than over-eating. Most positively must Dyspeptics avoid <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water with their meals. If the saliva and gastric juice are diluted with an abundance of <emph rend="italic">any</emph> fluid, they never have the same properties to aid, or carry on digestion, which they had before dilution; then the only hope of the <emph rend="italic">Dyspeptic</emph> is to use no fluid with his food, nor until digestion has had her perfect work.</p>
</formula>
<p>CAUTION.--I may be allowed to give a word of caution to Mothers, as well as to all others. <emph rend="italic">One</emph> plate of food is
 
<pb n="91" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=97"/>
enough for health--two, and even three, are often eaten. Most persons have heard of the lady who did not want a "cart load," but when she got to eating, it all disappeared, and the retort, "Back up your cart and I will load it again," was just what I would have expected to hear if the load had been given to a Dyspeptic, which it no doubt was; then learn the proper amount of food necessary for health, and when that is eaten, by yourself or child, stop. If pudding is on the table and you choose to have a little of it, it is all right--have some pudding; if pie, have a piece of pie; or cake, have a piece of cake; but do not have all, and that after you have eaten twice as much meat victuals as health requires. If apples, melons, raisins or nuts are on the table, and you wish some of them, eat them before meal, and never after it; if surprise is manifested around you, say you <emph rend="italic">eat</emph> to live, not live to <emph rend="italic">eat.</emph> The reason for this is, that persons will eat all they need, and often more, of common food, then eat nuts, raisins, melons, &#38;c., until the stomach is not only filled beyond comfort, but actually distended to its utmost capacity of endurance; being led on by the <emph rend="italic">taste,</emph> when if the reverse course was taken, the stomach becomes satisfied when a proper amount of the more common food has been eaten, after the others.</p>
<p>Are you a Grocer, and constantly nibbling at raisins, candy, cheese, apples, and every other edible? Stop, until just before meal, then eat what you like, go to your meal, and return, not touching again until meal-time, and you are safe; continue the nibbling, and you do it at the sacrifice of future health. Have you children or other young persons under your care? See that they eat only a reasonable quantity at meals, and not anything between them; <emph rend="italic">do this,</emph> and I am willing to be called a <emph rend="italic">fool</emph> by the younger ones, which I am sure to be; but do it not, and <emph rend="italic">the</emph> fool will <emph rend="italic">suffer</emph> for his folly.</p>
<p>You may consider me a hard Doctor--be it so then; the drunkard calls him hard names who says give up your "cups," but as sure as he would die a drunkard, so sure you will die a Dyspeptic unless you give up your <emph rend="italic">over-eating</emph> and <emph rend="italic">over-drinking</emph> of water, tea, coffee, wine, beer, ale, &#38;c.

<p>LARYNGITIS,--INFLAMMATION OF THE THROAT.--This complaint, in a chronic form, has become very prevalent, and is a disease which is aggravated by every change of weather, more especially in the fall and winter months. It is considered, and that justly, a very hard disease to cure, but with caution, time, and a rational course of treatment, it can be cured.</p>
<p>The difficulty with most persons is, they think that it is an uncommon disease, and consequently they must obtain some uncommon preparation to cure it, instead of which, some of the more simble remedies, as follows, will cure nearly every case, if persevered in a sufficient length of time. First, then, take the:</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose><alt synonym1="laryngitis">ALTERNATIVE FOR DISEASES OF THE SKIN.</alt></purpose>--Compound <ingredient>tincture of peruvian bark</ingredient> 6 ozs.; fluid <ingredient>extract of sarsaparilla</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>extract of conium</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>iodide of potash,</ingredient> (often called hydriodate) 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>iodine</ingredient> 1/2 dr.; dissolve the <ingredient>extract of conium</ingredient> and the
 
<pb n="93" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=99"/>
powders in a little of the fluid, and mix all. DOSE--Two teaspoons 3 times daily, before meals, until all is taken. Shake the bottle well before using.</p>
</formula>
<p>In the next place, take the:</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>2. <purpose><alt synonym1="laryngitis">GARGLE FOR SORE THROAT.</alt></purpose>--Very strong <ingredient>sage tea</ingredient> 1/2 pt.; strained <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> <ingredient>common salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>strong vinegar,</ingredient> of each 2 tablespoons; <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> the pulverized, one rounding tea-spoon; steeping the <ingredient>cayenne</ingredient> with the <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> strain, mix, and bottle for use, gargling from 4 to a dozen times daily according to the severity of the case.</p>
<p>This is one of the very best gargles in use. By persevering some three months, I cured a case of two years standing where the mouths of the Eustachian tubes constantly discharged matter at their openings through the tonsils into the patients mouth, he having previously been quite deaf, the whole throat being also diseased. I used the preparation for "Deafness" also as mentioned under that head.</p>
<p>Remembering always to breath through nature's channel for the breath, the nose.</p>
<p>Besides the foregoing, you will wash the whole surface twice a week with plenty of the <ingredient>"Toilet Soap,</ingredient>" in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> wiping dry, then with a coarse dry towel rub the whole surface for ten minutes at least, and accomplish the coarse towel part of it every night and morning until the skin will remain through the day with its flushed surface, and genial heat; this draws the blood from the throat and other internal organs, or in other words, equalizes the circulation; know, and act, upon this fact, and no inflammation can long exist, no matter where it is located. Blood accumulates in the part inflamed, but let it flow evenly through the whole system, and of course there can be no inflammation.</p>
</formula>
<p>You will also apply to the throat and breast the following:</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>3. <purpose><alt synonym1="laryngitis">SORE THROAT LINIMENT.</alt></purpose>--<ingredient>Gum camphor</ingredient> 2 ozs.; <ingredient>castile soap,</ingredient> shaved fine, 1 dr.; <ingredient>oil</ingredient> of turpentine 1 table-spoon; <ingredient>oil of origanum</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>opium</ingredient> 1/4 oz.; <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> 1 pt. In a week or ten days it will be fit for use, then bathe the parts freely 2 or 3 times daily.</p>
<p>This liniment would be found useful in almost any throat or other disease where an outward application might be needed. If the foregoing treatment should fail, there is no alternative
 
<pb n="94" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=100"/>
but to bring in <emph rend="italic">emetics</emph> with the other treatment, and continue them for <emph rend="italic">a long time.</emph></p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>I mention the emetic plan last, from the fact that so many people utterly object to the emetic treatment. But when everything else fails, that steps in and <emph rend="italic">saves</emph> the patient, which goes to show how <emph rend="italic">unjust</emph> the prejudice. By the phrase, a long time, I mean several weeks, twice daily at first, then once a day, and finally thrice to twice a week, &#38;c. A part of this course you will see, by the following, is corroborated by the celebrated <ingredient>Lung</ingredient> and Throat Doctor, <attribution>S. S. Fitch, of New York,</attribution> who says "it is a skin disease, and that purifying medicines are necessary to cleanse the blood--taking long, full breaths," &#38;c. This is certainly good sense. His <purpose>treatment of throat diseases</purpose>is summed up in the following:</p>
<p>NOTE.--"Wear but little clothing around the neck--chew often a little <ingredient>nut-gall</ingredient> and swallow the <ingredient>juice</ingredient>--wear a wet cloth about the throat at night, having a dry towel over it--bathe freely all over as in consumption, and especially bathe the throat with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> every morning, also wash out the inside of the throat with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--avoid crowded rooms--gargle with a very weak <ingredient>solution of nitrate</ingredient> of silver--chewing gold thread and swallowing the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> and saliva from it--<ingredient>borax</ingredient> and <ingredient>honey</ingredient> occasionally, and <ingredient>gum arabic water,</ingredient> if much irritation--use the voice as little as possible until well, also often using a liniment externally."</p>
<p>I had hoped for very much benefit from using <ingredient>croton oil</ingredient> externally, but time has shown that the advantage derived from it is not sufficient to remunerate for the excessive irritation caused by its continued application.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>4. Smoking dried <ingredient>mullein leaves</ingredient> in a pipe not having been used for <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient> is said to have cured many cases of <purpose>Laryngitis.</purpose>And I find in my last <attribution>Eclectic Medical Journal</attribution> so strong a corroboration, taken from the Medical and Surgical Reporter, of this fact, that I cannot refrain from giving tho quotation. It says: "in that form of disease in which there is dryness of the trachea, <emph rend="italic">with a constant desire to clear the throat,</emph> attended with little expectoration, and considerable pain in the part affected, the mullein smoked through a pipe, acts like a charm, and affords instant relief. It seems to act as an anodyne in allaying irritation, while it promotes expectoration, and removes that gelatinous mucus
 
<pb n="95" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=101"/>
which gathers in the larynx, and, at the same time, by some <emph rend="italic">unknown power,</emph> completely changes the nature of the disease, and, if persevered in, will produce a radical cure."</p>
<p>We read in a certain place of a gentleman who was walking around and through a great city, and he came across an inscription "To the <emph rend="italic">unknown</emph> God"--and directly we find him explaining that unknown Being to the astonished inhabitants. And I always feel, like this old-fashioned gentleman, to cry out, upon every convenient occasion, my belief, that it was <emph rend="italic">that</emph> God's <emph rend="italic">great</emph> wisdom, seeing what was required, and His <emph rend="italic">exceeding</emph> goodness, providing according to our necessities, this wonderful, and to some, that <emph rend="italic">unknown</emph> power in the thousands of plants around us. What matters it to us how it is done? If the cure is performed, it is sufficient.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the foregoing, in the ninth edition, I have been smoking the <ingredient>dried mullein,</ingredient> and recommending it to others. It has given general satisfaction for coughs and as a substitute for tobacco in smoking, exhilerating the nerves, and allaying the hacking coughs from recent colds, by breathing the smoke into the lungs. In one instance, after retiring, I could not rest from an irritation in the upper portion of the lungs and throat, frequently hacking without relief only for a moment; I arose, filled my pipe with mullein, returning to bed I smoked the pipeful, drawing it into the lungs, and did not cough again during the night.</p>
<p>An old gentleman, an inveterate smoker, from my suggestion, began to mix the <ingredient>mullein</ingredient> with his <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient> one-fourth at first, for awhile; then half, and finally three-fourths; at this point he rested. It satisfied in place of the full amount of <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient> and cured a cough which had been left upon him after inflammation of the lungs. The flavor can hardly be distinguished from the flavor of tobacco smoke, in rooms.</p>
<p>It can be gathered any time during the season, the centre stem removed, carefully dried, and rubbed fine, when it is ready for use. It gives a pipe the phthysic, as fast as it cures one on the patient; but the <implement>clay pipe,</implement> which is to be used, can be readily cleansed by burning out.</p>

<p><purpose>CANCERS.--TO CURE</purpose>--METHOD OF <attribution>DR. LANDOLFI, (SURGEON-GENERAL OF THE NEAPOLITAN ARMY)</attribution> AND SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN METHODS.--The principle upon which the treatment is based, consists in transforming a tumor of a malignant character, by conferring upon it a character of benignity, which admits of cure. This transformation is effected by cauterization with an agent looked upon as a specific, viz: chloride of bromine, combined, or not, with other substances, which have already been tried, but have hitherto been employed separately. The internal treatment is merely auxiliary. (Cancers may be known from other tumors by their shooting, or lancinating pains; and if an open sore, from their great fetor.--AUTHOR.) The formulas for the caustics are, with the exception of a few cases, the following:</p>
<p>Equal parts of the chlorides of zinc, gold, and antimony, mixed with a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to form a <ingredient>viscid paste.</ingredient></p>
<p>At Vienna, he used a mixture of the same substances in different proportions, chloride of <ingredient>bromine</ingredient> 3 parts; <ingredient>chloride of zinc</ingredient> 2 parts; <ingredient>chloride of gold and antimony,</ingredient> each 1 part; made into a thick paste with powdered <ingredient>licorice root.</ingredient> This preparation should be made in an open place, on account of the gases which are disengaged.</p>
<p>The essential element is the <ingredient>chloride of bromine,</ingredient> which has often been employed alone; thus, chloride of bromine from 2 1/2 to 4 drs., and put <ingredient>licorice root</ingredient> as much as sufficient.</p>
<p><variation>The <ingredient>chloride of zinc</ingredient> is indispensable in <purpose>ulcerated cancers,</purpose>in which it acts as a hemastatic, (stopping blood.)</variation> <variation>The chloride of gold is only useful in cases of <purpose>encephaloid, (brain-like) cancers,</purpose>in which it exercises a special, if not a specific action.</variation> <variation><purpose>Cancers of the skin, (epitheliomas,) lupus, and small cystosarcomas, (watery or bloody tumors,)</purpose>are treated with bromine mixed with basilicon ointment in the
 
<pb n="97" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=103"/>
proportion of one part of bromine to eight of the ointment; the application should not extend to the healthy parts, its action being often propagated through a space of one or two lines.</variation> The <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is only allowed to remain on about twenty-four hours; on removing the dressing a line of demarkation is almost always found separating the healthy from the morbid parts. The tumor is itself in part whitish and part reddish, or marbled with yellow and blue. The <ingredient>caustic</ingredient> is replaced with the poultice, or with compresses smeared with basilicon ointment only, which are to be removed every three hours until the scar is detached; the pain progressively diminishing in proportion as the mortification advances, the line of demarkation daily becomes more evident; about the fourth or fifth day the cauterized portion begins to rise, and from the eighth to the fifteenth day it becomes detached, or can be removed with <implement>forceps,</implement> and without pain, exposing a suppurating surface, secreting pus of good quality and covered with healthy granulations. If any points remain of less satisfactory appearance, or present traces of morbid growth, a little of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is to be again applied, then dress the sore as you would a simple ulcer; <variation><purpose>if the suppuration proceeds too slowly,</purpose><alt synonym1="dress it">dressit</alt> with lint dipped in the following solution:</variation></p>
<p><ingredient>Chloride of bromine</ingredient> 20 or 30 drops; <ingredient>Goulard's Extract</ingredient> from 1 to 2 drs.; <ingredient>distilled water</ingredient> 16 ozs.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases healing takes place rapidly, cicatrization progresses from the circumference to the center, no complications supervene, and the cicatrix (scar,) resembles that left by a cutting instrument. <variation>His <purpose>internal remedy, to prevent a relapse,</purpose>is,</variation></p>
<p><ingredient>Chloride of bromine</ingredient> 2 drops; powder of the <ingredient>seeds of water fennel</ingredient> 23 grs.; <ingredient>extract of hemlock</ingredient> (Conium Maculatum) 12 grs.; mix and divide into 20 pills; one to be taken daily for 2 months, and after that, 2 pills daily for a month or two longer, 1 night and morning, after meals.</p>
<p>In any case of Cancer, either the foregoing, internal remedy, or some of the other Alteratives, should be taken two or three weeks before the treatment is commenced, and should also be continued for several weeks after its cure.</p>

The directions were sent to him by his father, <attribution>John Dillon, Sen., of Zanesville, O.,</attribution> and, from my knowledge of the Dillon family, I have the utmost confidence in the prescription. It is as follows:</p>
<p>Take red <ingredient>oak bark ashes</ingredient> 1 peck; put on to them, <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> 6 qts.; let it stand 12 hours; then draw off the <ingredient>ley</ingredient> and boil to a thick salve; spread this, pretty thick, upon a thick cloth a little larger than the cancer, and let it remain on 3 hours; if it is too severe, half of that time; the same day, or the next, apply again 3 hours, which will generally effect a cure; after the last plaster, wash the sore with <ingredient>warm milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water;</ingredient> then apply a healing salve made of <ingredient>mutton tallow,</ingredient> <ingredient>bark of elder,</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>rosin</ingredient> and <ingredient>bees-wax,</ingredient> (some <ingredient>root of white lilly</ingredient> may be added,) stewed over a slow fire; when the sore begins to matterate, wash it 3 or 4 times daily, renewing the salve each time; avoid strong diet, and strong drink, but drink a <ingredient>tea of sassafras root</ingredient> and <ingredient>spice-wood tops,</ingredient> for a week before and after the plaster.</p>

<p><purpose>CHRONIC GOUT--TO CURE</purpose>--"Take hot <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and put into it all the <ingredient>table salt</ingredient> which it will dissolve, and bathe the parts affected with a soft piece of <implement>flannel.</implement> Rub in with the hand, and dry the <ingredient>foot,</ingredient> &#38;c., by the fire. Repeat this operation four times in the 24 hours, 15 minutes each time, for four days; then twice a day for the same period; then once, and follow this rule whenever the symptoms show themselves at any future time."</p>
<p>The philosophy of the above formula is as follows: Chronic gout proceeds from the obstruction of the free circulation of the blood (in the parts affected) by the deposit of a chalky substance, which is generally understood to be a carbonate and <ingredient>phosphate of lime.</ingredient> <ingredient>Vinegar</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> dissolve these; and the old chronic compound is broken up. The <ingredient>carbonate of lime,</ingredient> &#38;c., become acetate and muriate, and these being soluble, are taken up by the circulating system, and discharged by secretion. This fact will be seen by the gouty joints becoming less and less in bulk until they assume their natural size. During this process, the stomach and bowels should be occasionally regulated by a gentle purgative. Abstinence from spirituous libations; exercise in the open air, and especially in the morning; freely bathing the whole surface; eating only the plainest food, and occupying the time by study, or useful employment, are very desirable assistants.</p>

<p>PARALYSIS,--IF RECENT--TO CURE.--When paralysis, (numb palsy) has existed for a great length of time, but little benefit can be expected from any treatment; but if recent, very much good, if not a perfect cure will be the result of faithfully governing yourself by the following directions with this:</p>

in very recent cases to keep the parts covered with flannels, with a large amount of friction by the hand; also, electricity scientifically applied, that is by a Physician or some one who has studied the nature and operations of the electrical machine.</p>
<p>This liniment should be applied so freely, that about an ounce a day will be consumed, on an arm or leg, and if a whole side is palsied, proportionolly more. In cases of pains in the stomach or side a tea-spoon will be taken with unusual success; or for pain in the head, apply to the surface, always bearing in mind that some should be taken internally whenever an external application is made. In sprains and bruises where the surface is not broken it will be found very efficacious. It may be, successfully, rubbed over the seat of any internal disease accompanied with pain.</p>

<p>After the operation, and when the stomach becomes a little settled, some nourishment will be desired, when any of the mild broths, or gruel, should be taken, in small quantities, without fear of increasing the difficulty.</p>
<p>"There is, probably, no emetic surpassing this, either in efficacy of action, or efficiency in breaking up morbid, unhealthy conditions of the system generally; and exciting healthy action.

Perhaps he will blame me for publishing information gained in that way, but I obtain knowledge for the benefit of the people; and as I have called on the Doctor two different times, to sell my work, but could not succeed, I do not feel under any special obligations to him, and if I did, I go in for the greatest good to the greatest number. Were it not so, I should not publish <emph rend="italic">much</emph> that is contained in this work, for there are many persons who have and are making fortunes out of single recipes, now published for the benefit of the world.</p>
<p>Because I could not sell my Recipes to I. L. St. John, a Druggist of Tiffin, O., however, is not saying that I do not sell them to Druggists generally, as I do. In Aurora, Ill., I sold to six, and in Pomeroy, O., to seven, every one in either place, which is not common. They are, however, not only anxious to obtain information generally, but also willing to impart it to others; and how Mr. St. John should have obtained as good recipes as the ones here attributed to him, without sometime having bought, is a little surprising; for, as a general rule, those who put out "Patent Medicines," are not themselves the originators of the recipes; even Dr. Jayne is reported, I know not how truly, to have picked up the recipe, in an out-house, for his celebrated Alterative, I say, then, am I not justified in publishing these recipes? Nay, more! am I not honorable in thus benefiting the people? I rest the matter with them; always willing to abide their decision.</p>
<p>Persons only wishing to put up for their own use, will take one-seventieth of the various amounts, which will be about as follows:</p>
<p><variation><ingredient>Turpentine and seneca oils,</ingredient> of each 7 1/3 ozs.; <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>tincture of arnica,</ingredient> of each 3 2/3 ozs.; <ingredient>oils of origanum,</ingredient> <ingredient>hemlock, juniper,</ingredient> <ingredient>amber,</ingredient> and <ingredient>laudanum,</ingredient> of each 1 1/3 ozs.; <ingredient>spirits of ammonia</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; and <ingredient>gum camphor</ingredient> 1/4 oz.; which makes a little less than 1 qt., there being 64 qts., besides the <ingredient>gum camphor,</ingredient> in the whole amount.</variation></p>
<p>This calculation will be sufficiently near for all practical purposes.</p>
<p>I have sold the condition powder and liniment, out of the

drug store, made by the Doctor, which has always given good satisfaction. And I think any one who tries both will be as well pleased with those made from these recipes as with that which is sent out from Tiffin, and make it for one-fourth the cost of the other.</p>

<p>Consumption may justly be called the King of diseases, but he has, many times, been obliged to haul down his colors, and give place to health, and consequent happiness, when he came in contact with the above syrup. It does not, however, contain any of the articles usually put into syrups for this disease--this of itself ought to obtain for it a consideration. I have been told, and that by a professional man, that there was not an article in it of any value for consumption. I have acknowledged it does not contain any articles <emph rend="italic">commonly</emph> used for that disease; but allow me to ask if they cure the disease in one case out of a hundred? The answer is, No. I am now using this on a case within a few miles of the city, who had called one of our Professors. He promised benefit, and did benefit about one week; subsequently, two other physicians were also called without any lasting benefit. He had not cut his wood for nearly a year, nor done other labor to any extent; he has now taken our syrup nearly three months; he was weak, spare in flesh, and coughed very much, with cold feet and surface; he is now stout, fleshy, and scarcely any cough; surface and feet warm. What
 
<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=126"/>
more could be asked? Yet he is very careless, for I called on him on a cold, snowy day lately, and he was in the woods, for wood. Do I need better proof of its value? No one would expect sickness of the stomach to arise from its use, from the articles of which it is composed, but the first dose usually makes the person rather sick at the stomach, and sometimes vomits, but don't fear to continue its use. I had rather trust to tamarack-bark tea than three-fourths of the consumptive syrups of the day. Let every one who is afflicted with cough, be careful to avoid exposure as much as possible. Remember, with this <emph rend="italic">syrup,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">disease,</emph> as long as there is life, there is hope.</p>
<p>But it would be deceptive and wicked to hold out to <emph rend="italic">all</emph> consumptives the idea that they could be cured--facts speak like this, although I have never seen it in print, nor heard the remark, but my own observation says that nine of every ten <emph rend="italic">hereditary</emph> consumptives, will, in the end, die of the disease, while an equal number of those whose disease is brought on by colds being neglected, or from neglect of acute inflammations, &#38;c., may be cured. Then those who know their parents or others in their family to have gone with this disease, need hardly expect a cure, notwithstanding much benefit may be derived from <emph rend="italic">care,</emph> with the above treatment, good diet, and out-of-door exercise, while those whose systems are not tainted from parents may expect a permanent cure.</p>
<p>I shall now throw in a few thoughts of my own, and from the experience of many others in the profession, which I hope may benefit all, needing light on the subject.</p>
<p>FIRST, then--Do not go South, to smother and die; but go North, for cool, fresh air, hunt, fish, and eat freely of the roasted game; cast away care, after having trusted all in Christ, that it may be well, living or dying. Take a healthy, faithful friend with you, to lean upon when needed, in your rambles. So shall it be well with many who would otherwise sink to the consumptive's grave. Have your potatoes with you, and roast them in the embers; your corn meal also, which you will mix with cold water, having a little salt in it, and bake on a board before the fire, and then say you cannot make out a good-flavored meal, and a healthy one also, from your roast <emph rend="italic">venison,</emph> or broiled <emph rend="italic">fish,</emph> with <emph rend="italic">roast</emph> potatoes 
 
<pb n="121" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=127"/>
and <emph rend="italic">johnny</emph>-cake, I will then acknowledge that you are indeed far gone on the consumptive's track, and <emph rend="italic">especially</emph> if you have been wandering over hills and through the valleys of our northern country in pursuit of the game of which you are about to partake.</p>
<p>SECONDLY--Do not leave home after having tried everything else in vain, and just ready to wrap the mantle of the grave around you; then you need all the care of many friends, and a quiet place to die; but strike out the first thing when you become certain that permanent disease has fastened upon the lungs; then you may not only reasonably expect a cure, but be almost certain. Have the means with you to avoid getting wet by rains; but often wash and rub the whole surface, wearing <implement>flannel</implement> next the skin, and clothe yourself according to the weather and sex; for there is no reason why females should not pursue about the same course. They can dress <emph rend="italic">a la Bloomer,</emph> and with their father, husband, brother, or other <emph rend="italic">known</emph> friend, derive the same benefit from out-door exercise, like field or forest rambles, botanical huntings, geological surveys, or whatever sports or realities may give just the amount of exercise not to <emph rend="italic">fatigue</emph> the invalid.</p>
<p>For females who have families and cannot leave them, gardening will be the best substitute for the travel, or of all the employments which can be engaged in.</p>
<p>LASTLY--Those who are already far down the consumptive track and confined at home, will derive much benefit by using, at each meal, half a pint of rich, fresh cream. In <emph rend="italic">all</emph> cases it is ahead of Cod-Liver Oil, with <emph rend="italic">none</emph> of its disagreeableness. And if it can be borne, a tea, to a table-spoon of the best brandy may be added.</p>
<p>Much is being said, now-a-days, about the necessity of constant inflation of the lungs by long-drawn breaths, holding the breath, also, as long as possible, when thus fully inflated; but, for those whose lungs are extensively diseased, it is not only useless, but very dangerous, from the liability to burst blood-vessels in the lungs, causing hemorrhage, if not instant death. In the commencement of the disease, however, or for those in health, the practice is decidedly good.</p>

<p>3. <purpose>CHLORATE OF POTASH, FOR CONSUMPTION.</purpose>--A gentleman of Iowa read a paper about a year ago before the "American Medical Association," upon the subject of Chlorate of Potash in Consumption, giving the history of a few cases only. For the want of a more extended trial of it, the Association thought best not to publish his paper, but referred it back to him, and to the consideration of the other members for further test.</p>
<p>Amongst those members is Dr. A. B. Palmer, of this city, one of the Vice-Presidents of the Association, and Professor of "Practice, Materia Medica," &#38;c., in the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor--by the way, a gentleman and a scholar. Having had much experience in practice, he saw fit to give it a trial. He has used it in about thirty cases, and with a single exception with marked success; and in that case there was at first much improvement, but the patient was a German who does not understand our language very well, and from this fact when he found that it caused a heat or burning sensation in the stomach, instead of going to the Professor and having the quantity lessened, he abandoned it altogether. But through Prof. Palmer's kindness I have been permitted to refer to other cases where a very marked amelioration has taken place. One of these, a married lady, although her lungs were full of tubercles, with much coughing, soreness of the lungs, with sharp pains upon full breaths being taken, &#38;c., finds her cough loose, soreness all gone, and that full breaths can be taken without pain, (or stitching, as commonly called,) and fully believes that if she could have had this prescription early in the disease, she would now have been well, yet derives much relief from its use. Another lady has been using it only a few months, and finds that her symptoms are all very much relieved, and she has gained seventeen pounds in flesh.</p>
<p>The Professor assures me that in the first few cases where he prescribed the chlorate, the benefits were so marked, it was really astonishing; which, of course, caused him to go on in its use, until, as before remarked, about thirty cases have been more or less benefitted by its use, under his care.</p>
 
<pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=129"/>
<p>His method of giving it is to put about a tea-spoon of the chlorate into a glass of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which is to be drank a little at a time, in from six to twenty-four hours, with other appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>If in any case the chlorate should cause a heat or burning sensation at the stomach, lessen the quantity; and unless this does occur, no apprehensions need be felt in using it. It improves the general symptoms, lessening the pulse, &#38;c., whilst the <ingredient>Cod-Liver Oil</ingredient> has never done anything more than to benefit merely as food; and from its very disgusting smell and taste, and the almost impossibility of keeping it upon the stomach, I greatly prefer the fresh <ingredient>sweet cream</ingredient> mentioned above, or the <ingredient>fat meat,</ingredient> as mentioned below.</p>
<p>The hyper-phosphites have been extensively used, but Prof. Palmer tells me that in Paris and other parts of Europe, where he traveled during the past summer, that not one well authenticated case of cure by them can be produced. Bet he feels much encouraged to hope that the chlorate will prove itself worthy of great confidence.</p>
<p>The above was written one year ago; and the reports coming in since then, both in America and from Europe, more than confirms the <emph rend="italic">expected</emph> benefits and hoped-for advantages from the use of the <emph rend="italic">chlorate</emph> in this disease.</p>

<p>4. REMARKS ON THE USE OF FAT MEATS--PREVENTIVE OF CONSUMPTION.--There is so much said against the use of fat meats, and especially pork, as an article of diet, that I cannot better close my remarks upon this subject than by giving the opposite opinions of those in high places, corroborated also by my own experience.</p>
<p>Dr. Dixon, of the Scalpel, some time ago, assumed the position that "the use of oils would diminish the victims of consumption nine-tenths, and that that was the whole secret of the use of Cod-Liver Oil, to take the place of fat meats."</p>
<p>Dr. Hooker's observations on the use of fat meats connected with consumption, are as follows:</p>
<p>"FIRST--Of all persons between the ages of 15 and 22 years, more than one-fifth eat no fat meat. SECOND--Of persons at the age of 45, all, excepting less than 1 in 50, habitually use fat meat. THIRD--Of persons who, between the ages of 15 and 22, avoid fat meat, a few acquire an appetite for it, and live to a 
 
<pb n="124" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=130"/>
good old age, while the greater portion die with phthesis (consumption,) before 35. FOURTH--Of persons dying with phthesis between the ages of 12 and 45, nine-tenths, at least, have never used fat meats."</p>
<p>"Most individuals who avoid fat meat, also use little butter or oily gravies, though many compensate for this want-in part, at least, by a free use of those articles, and also milk, eggs, and various saccharine substances. But they constitute an imperfect substitute for fat meat, without which, sooner or later, the body is almost sure to show the effects of deficient calorification."</p>
<p>A lady-lecturer recently said in this city, in one of her lectures--"Set a piece of <emph rend="italic">pork</emph> before a lady: oh, horrible! the dirty, nasty, filthy stuff; give us <emph rend="italic">chicken</emph>--clean, nice chicken." Now this lady, certainly, was no farmer's wife, or she would have observed that the habits of chickens are ten times more filthy than that of the hog, if it be possible; for even the hog's leavings and droppings are carefully overhauled by them, and much of it appropriated to "Ladies' meat." But their filthiness is no argument in either case; for nature's strainer, (the stomach,) throws off all impurities. Why do so many young <emph rend="italic">ladies,</emph> young <emph rend="italic">clergymen,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">students</emph> die of consumption? Simply because <emph rend="italic">chicken</emph> or other <emph rend="italic">lean</emph> meats, hot biscuit, &#38;c., without exercise, make up the sums of their diet; when, if they would eat fat meats, with bread not less than one day old, scrub floors, saw wood, or other arm exercise, according to sex, an hour at each end of each day, they might be spared for years--perhaps to long lives of usefulness, to their families, congregations, or the world.</p>
<p>5. So far as <emph rend="italic">pork</emph> is concerned as food, the following rule may be safely followed: If it agrees with the stomach, which is known by its digesting without "Risings," as it is called, its use may be continued, but if it rises, lessen the quantity, and if it still rises, abandon its use altogether; but it digests better with me than mutton, or <emph rend="italic">chicken,</emph> and I have been trying them for nearly <emph rend="italic">fifty</emph> years. The same rule is good for all articles of food. As to exercise, for men who are not regular laborers, wood-sawing is the best, next, horseback riding, then walking; for women, hoeing in the garden or field, next sweeping, dusting, &#38;c., then horseback riding, walking, &#38;c.</p>

<p>6. But I have recently seen a piece going the rounds of the <ingredient>papers</ingredient> as the best cure for <purpose>consumption</purpose>in the world, which contains so much good sense that I will close my remarks on the subject by giving it a quotation, and let every one judge for themselves, which to try, if they see fit to give either a trial. It is represented as coming from an <emph rend="italic">exchange</emph> only, but from its style of remark, I think it must have started from <attribution>Hall's Journal of Health:</attribution></p>
<p>"Eat all that the appetite requires of the most nourishing food, such as fresh <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>raw eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> and 3 times a day take a glass of <ingredient>egg-nog,</ingredient> made as rich as the patient can bear. Avoid all other alcoholic drinks. Bathe twice a week in <ingredient>water</ingredient> made agreably warm, and in a warm room; after bathing rub the body and limbs with <ingredient>sweet cream</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet oil.</ingredient> Exercise daily in the open air; walking is the best. Stand erect, exercise the arms and lungs freely, keep the mind cheerful; take freely of the best <ingredient>cough syrup,</ingredient> and consumption will be a stranger to your household.</p>
<p><variation>"For making the best <purpose>cough syrup,</purpose> take 1 oz. of thorough-wort; 1 oz. of <ingredient>slippery elm;</ingredient> 1 oz. of stick <ingredient>licorice,</ingredient> and 1 oz. of <ingredient>flax seed;</ingredient> simmer together in 1 qt. of <ingredient>water</ingredient> until the strength is entirely extracted. Strain carefully, add 1 pt. of best <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and 1/2 lb. of <ingredient>loaf sugar;</ingredient> simmer them all well together, and when cold bottle tight. This is the cheapest, best, and safest medicine now or ever in use."</variation></p>
<p>"A few doses of one table-spoon at a time will alleviate the most distressing cough of the lungs, soothes and allays irritation, and if continued, subdues any tendency to consumption; breaks up entirely the whooping cough, and no better remedy can be found for croup, asthma, bronchitis, and all affections of the lungs and throat. Thousands of precious lives may be saved every year by this cheap and simple remedy, as well as thousands of dollars which would otherwise be spent in the purchase of nostrums which are both useless and dangerous."--<attribution rend="italic">Exchange.</attribution> For <ingredient>egg</ingredient>-nog see "Stimulant in Low Fevers."</p>

<p>Linseed-<ingredient>oil</ingredient> 1 pt.; <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> 1 oz.; and boil them in a kettle on <ingredient>coals</ingredient> for nearly 4 hours, as warm as you can; then have pulverized and mixed, <ingredient>borax</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>red lead</ingredient> 4 ozs., and <ingredient>sugar of lead</ingredient> 1 1/2 ozs.; remove the kettle from the fire and thicken in the powder; continue the stirring until cooled to blood heat, then stir in 1 oz. of <ingredient>spirits of turpentine;</ingredient> and now take out a little, letting it get cold, and if not then sufficiently thick to spread upon thin, soft linen, as a salve, you will boil again until this point is reached.</p>
<p>He says, and I have no doubt of it, that it is good for all kinds of wounds, bruises, sores, burns, white swellings, rheumatisms, ulcers, sore breasts, and even where there are wounds on the inside, it has been used with advantage, by applying plaster over the part.</p>

<p>In deep wounds and old sores this works admirably, it keeps out proud flesh and heals beyond all calculation, keeping up a healthy discharge.

from healing until it healed from the bottom, and thus saved the horse, which everybody said must die; and of course everybody always knows. The man owning the horse was thrown from his buggy whilst the horse was running, and had a leg broken; the horse was well before the man. Hiram Sisson, an old farrier and farmer, of Crown Point, Essex Co., N. Y., has used this and the one bearing his name, No. 3, several years, and speaks of them in the highest terms. Mr. Wykoff, a few miles north of this city, has used this green ointment for several years, curing a deep cut in the thigh of a friend in a few days with it, which induced him to pay ten dollars to an English lady for the recipe; since then he cured a bad case of chilblains, with it, upon a German boy who had not worn boot or shoe for three years, on their account. I have now known it for two years, curing cuts on horses' feet, from stepping over corn stubble in spring ploughing, by only a few applications. It is worth more than the cost of this book to any family who has not got it.</p>

<p>REMARKS.--It is a well known fact that much injury is done to children by the use of anodynes, such as the above, and "Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup," which is now taking the place, to a great extent, in towns of the foregoing, for I noticed a short time ago eighty-seven empty bottles with Mrs. Winslow's label upon them, sitting on a counter of one of our drug stores, which led me to ask if they put up her syrup. The answer was no, a <emph rend="italic">lady</emph> in this city has fed that much to <emph rend="italic">one</emph> child within the past <emph rend="italic">eighteen</emph> months.</p>
<p>The question might be asked, why do you tell people how to make <emph rend="italic">any</emph> of these anodynes? Because they are good in proper cases, when properly used, and to give a place for these remarks; for those who are evil disposed will find a way to accomplish their designs, whilst the well disposed will, or can, act only from knowledge, and if they do not know the evils arising from the constant use of anodynes on children, are as liable to do evil as the evil disposed.</p>
<p>Then let it be remembered that the constant use of opium in any of its preparations on children, or adults, disturbs the nervous system, and establishes a nervous necessity for its continuation. Then use them only in severe pain, or extreme nervousness, laying them by again as soon as possible under the circumstances of the case. Of course we do not give a receipe for the Soothing Syrup spoken of, as its exact composition has not yet come out to the public; but that its 
 
<pb n="135" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=141"/>
soothing properties are owing to opium, there is not the least doubt. See "Carminatives," which are preferable to opiates, especially for children.</p>

<p>There is no question but what both of these preparations, and the next also, are good, if made sufficiently strong with the barks.

<p>In the chronic, or long standing complaint, in addition to the above, there is generally flatulence, with pain in the stomach, foul breath and mouth, coated tongue, indigestion eyes yellow, stools clay colored, with great weakness and slow emaciation, frequently going on to ulceration, giving symptoms as mentioned under the head of "Ointment for Ulcerated Liver," &#38;c.</p>
<p>In the acute form you will pursue the same course as mentioned under the head of "Pleurisy," besides taking either of the Liver Pills or Liver Drops mentioned below, in full cathartic doses, until relieved; but in the chronic form, the Pills, in connection with the "Ointment," or "Irritating Plaster," will be found all sufficient, unless Jaundice has already set in; then look to the directions under that disease.</p>

There are many things of a similar character in the history of a number of individuals in the range of my acquaintance, more singular and more unaccountable than the above, which would be very interesting to relate, but the nature of this work does not admit. If this shall benefit any, I shall be satisfied.</p>

<p><purpose>HYDROPHOBIA AND SNAKE BITES--TO PREVENT, AND CURE.</purpose>--<attribution>A. Hubbard, of Boone Co., Ill.,</attribution> in a letter to the St. Louis Republican, says: "Eighteen years ago my brother and myself were bitten by a mad-dog. A sheep was also bitten at the same time. Among the many cures offered for the little boys, (we were then ten or twelve years old,) a friend suggested the following which he said would cure the bite of a rattlesnake:</p>
<p>"Take the root of the common upland ash, commonly called black ash, peel off the bark, boil it to a strong decoction, and of this, drink freely. Whilst my father was preparing the above, the sheep spoken of began to be afflicted with hydrophobia. When it had become so fatigued from its distracted state as to be no longer able to stand, my father drenched it with a pint of the <ingredient>ash root ooze,</ingredient> hoping to ascertain whether he could depend upon it as a cure for his sons. Four hours after the drench had been given, to the astonishment of all, the animal got up and went quietly with the flock to graze. My brother and myself continued to take the medicine for 8 or 10 days, 1 gill 3 times daily. No effects of the dread poison were ever discovered on either of us. It has been used very successfully in snake bites, to my knowledge."</p>
<p>There is no doubt in the author's mind but what this gentleman has made a mistake in the kind of ash meant, as the upland ash is <ingredient>white-ash,</ingredient> from which flooring is made, having a thick, rough outside bark, whilst the black has a smooth bark, and grows in low, wet land, and is the same from which the <implement>flour barrel hoop</implement> is extensively manufactured. It is the upland, <ingredient>white-ash</ingredient> that is to be used; it is known, as he says, to cure rattlesnake bites, and a gentleman of this place has tried it with success in rheumatism, boiled very strong and taken in half gill doses. May vomit and purge if taken too freely. Yet a moderate action, either up or down, will not be amiss. I have cured a case of rheumatism, in a boy twelve or fourteen years of age, with the above, since it came to my knowledge.</p>

<p>The dried root of elecampane, pulverize it and measure out 9 heaping table-spoons, and mix it with 2 or 3 tea-spoons of pulverized <ingredient>gum arabic;</ingredient> then divide into 9 equal portions. When a person is bitten by a rabid animal, take one of these portions and steep it in 1 pt. of <ingredient>new milk,</ingredient> until nearly half the quantity of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is evaporated; then strain, and drink it in the morning, fasting for 4 or 5 hours after. The same dose is to be repeated 3 mornings in succession, then skip 3, and so on until the 9 doses are taken.</p>
<p>The patient must avoid getting wet, or the heat of the sun, and abstain from high seasoned diet, or hard exercise, and, if costive, take a dose of salts. The above quantity is for an adult--children will take less according to age. The <emph rend="italic">Tribune's</emph> publication is as follows:</p>

<formula class="medhealth">
<p>5. <purpose>TRIBUNE'S CURE FOR HYDROPHOBIA.</purpose>--The following was sent to the N. Y. <emph rend="italic">Tribune,</emph> by J. W. Woolston, of Philadelphia:</p>
<p>"RECIPE.--First dose, 1 oz., of <ingredient>elecampane root,</ingredient> boiled in 1 pt. of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> until reduced to 1/2 pt. Second dose, (to be taken two

<p>If there is any virtue in the elecampane, at all, the preference, of course, is to be given to the Quaker's plan, which gives nine instead of three doses. But it substantiates Mr. Ely's plan, as it comes from the place of his father's former residence. Consequently it would seem to strengthen confidence in the first.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>6. <purpose>SNAKE BITES.</purpose>--In case of being bitten by any of the poisonous snakes, the best plan is to wash off the place <emph rend="italic">immediately;</emph> then if the position of the wound is such that you can get the <emph rend="italic">mouth</emph> to the spot, <emph rend="italic">suck</emph> out all the poison in that way, or if any other person is present, whose mouth is not sore, no danger need be apprehended.</p>
<p>For all the poison may be upon the outside, and washed off, yet most likely penetrates more or less into the wound, if a snake bite, as the arrangement of their teeth is such that the poison comes out <emph rend="italic">near</emph> the point and when in the wound, thus you see the propriety of sucking it out. Or:</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>7. <ingredient>Spirits of ammonia,</ingredient> a small vial of it, can be carried in the pocket, and if bitten, sharpen a little piece of wood to a small point, dipping this stick into the <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> and then penetrating the wound with it. A piece of lunar caustic can be carried in the pocket, and sharpened, if needed, and used the same as the stick and <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient>--and one of the celebrated English farriers has reported that this <ingredient>caustic,</ingredient> used freely on the <purpose><alt synonym1="hydrophobia" synonym2="snake bite">bite of the <emph rend="italic">mad dog,</emph></alt></purpose>destroys the poison; but to insure even a reasonable hope of success, it must be used <emph rend="italic">immediately.</emph> This holds good in any of the sucking or caustic applications.</p>
<p>All persons working on or near marshes, or wherever the massasauger is known to inhabit, should always have one of these caustics with them.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>8.

<p>The <attribution rend="italic">National Intelligencer,</attribution> a year or two since, published a recipe for the cure of the <purpose>rattlesnake bite,</purpose> which it claimed was infallible, it having been tried in a number of cases, and always with success.

is but justice to say that a daughter of Wm. Reed, of the town of Pittsfield, in this county, who was bitten on the arm some three years ago, was cured by drinking <ingredient>whisky</ingredient> until drunkenness and stupor were produced, and she has never felt any inconvenience from the bite since, which goes to show that the bite of the <emph rend="italic">Devil's tea</emph> is worse than the bite of a rattlesnake.</p>

This was my case exactly. In the commencement of my medical studies, I worked all day, reading half of the night, copying off the <emph rend="italic">latin terms,</emph> with their significations, on a slip of paper, which I carried in my pocket during the next day, looking at two or three of the terms at a time, through the day, until all were committed.

Four months, and the following treatment, did the work:</p>
<p>A <ingredient>syrup of Wahoo (Euonymus Atropurpureus)</ingredient>--and here let me say that the Wahoo is the great Indian remedy for purifying the blood--was made by boiling very strong, then <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and <ingredient>rum</ingredient> added to make it palatable and keep it from souring; this was used sufficient to keep the bowels solvent, sometimes chewing the <ingredient>bark of the root</ingredient> from which the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> is made, preferring it a part of the time to the <ingredient>syrup.</ingredient> The sore was dressed with the following salve: <ingredient>Rosin</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>mutton tallow</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>beeswax</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>linseed oil</ingredient> 1 pt.; <ingredient>ambrosial (highly flavored) soap</ingredient> 1 1/2 ozs.; to make it, mix in an iron kettle and simmer 2 hours, stirring all the time.

<p>I obtained the above from <attribution>S. B.

<p>This salve has no equal for rheumatic pains, or weakness in the side, back, shoulders, or any place where pain may locate itself. Where the skin is broken, as in ulcers, and bruises, I use it without the verdigris, making a white salve, even superior to "Peleg White's old salve." It is valuable in Dyspepsia, to put a plaster of the green salve over the stomach, and wear it as long as it will stay on, upon the back also, or any place where pain or weakness may locate. In cuts, bruises, abrasions, &#38;c., spread the <ingredient>white salve</ingredient> upon cloth and apply it as a <implement>sticking plaster</implement> until well; for rheumatism or weakness, spread the green salve upon soft leather and apply, letting it remain on as long as it will stay.

As though they had killed some one, the answer was, no, is there anything wrong; he held up both hands together, scoop shovel style, saying, "They fetched away the worms by the double handful." It is needless to attempt to give the symptoms by which the presence of worms might be distinguished; for the symptoms of nearly every other disease is, sometimes, manifested by their presence. But if the belly be quite hard and unusually large, with a peculiar and disagreeable breath, in the morning, foul or furred tongue, upper lip swollen, itching of the nose and anus, milky white urine, bowels sometimes obstinately costive, then as obstinately loose, with a craving appetite, then loathing food at times; rest assured that worm medicine will not be amiss, whether the person be child, or adult. It would be well to take a mild cathartic after four to six days use of the lozenges, unless the worms have passed off sufficiently free before that time, to show their general destruction. Very high praise has also been given to the following:</p>

<p><purpose>TAPE-WORM.--SIMPLE, BUT EFFECTUAL REMEDY.</purpose>--This, very annoying and distressing, worm has been removed by taking two ounce doses of common <ingredient>pumpkin-seeds,</ingredient> pulverized, and repeated every four or five hours, for four or five days; <ingredient>spirits of turpentine,</ingredient> also in doses of one-half to two ounces, with <ingredient>castor oil,</ingredient> have proved very effectual; the <ingredient>root of the male fern,</ingredient> <ingredient>valerian,</ingredient> <ingredient>bark of the pomegranate root,</ingredient> &#38;c., have been used with success. But my chief object in speaking upon this subject, is to give the successes of <attribution>Drs. Beach, of New York, and Dowler, of Beardstown, Ill.,</attribution> from their singularity and perfect eradication of the worm, in both cases: The first is from <attribution>"Beach's American Practice, and Family Physician,"</attribution> a large work, of three volumes, costing Twenty Dollars, consequently not generally circulated; whilst the latter is taken from the <attribution>"Eclectic Medical and College Journal," of Cincinnati,</attribution> and therefore only taken by physicians of that school. The last was first published by the <attribution>"New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal."</attribution> First then, Dr. Beach says:</p>
<p>"The symptoms of a tape-worm, as related to me by Miss Dumouline, who had suffered with it for twenty-five years, are in substance as follows: It commenced at the age of ten, and afflicted her to the age of thirty-five. The worm often made her distressingly sick at the stomach; she would sometimes vomit blood and be taken suddenly ill, and occasionally while walking. It caused symptoms of many other diseases, great wasting of the flesh, &#38;c. Her appetite was very capricious, being at times good, and then poor for months, during which time her symptoms were much aggravated; sickness, vomiting, great pain in the chest, stomach
 
<pb n="168" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=174"/>
and side, motion in the stomach, and also in the bowels, with pain, a sense of fullness or swelling, and beating or throbbing in the same, dizziness, heaviness of the eyes;--and she was altogether so miserable that she feared it would destroy her. When she laced or wore anything tight, it produced great distress. The worm appeared to rise up in her throat and sicken her. Her general health was very bad. At intervals, generally some time after taking medicine, pieces of the worm would pass from the bowels,--often as many as forty during the day, all alive, and would swim in <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>"TREATMENT.--Miss Dumouline stated that she had employed twenty physicians, at different periods, and taken a hundred different kinds of medicine without expelling the worm. She had taken <ingredient>spirits of turpentine,</ingredient> but could not retain it upon the stomach. Under these circumstances I commenced my treatment. Cowage stripped from the pod, a small tea-spoon three times a day, to be taken, fasting, in a little <ingredient>arrow-root jelly;</ingredient> then occasionally a purgative of mandrake. In connection with this, I directed her to eat freely of <ingredient>garlic,</ingredient> and <ingredient>common fine salt.</ingredient> I gave these under the belief that each article possessed vermifuge properties, without ever having administered them for the tape-worm. After having taken them for some time, all her unfavorable symptoms ceased, and subsequently the remaining portion of the worm passed lifeless from her--an unprecedented circumstance.</p>
<p>"She immediately recovered, and has since retained her health, and there is no evidence that there is any remaining. The patient stated that the worm which passed from her during the time she was afflicted with it, would fill a peck measure, and reach one mile in length. Her relief and gratitude may be better imagined than described. I have a portion of this worm in my possession. When once the tapeworm begins to pass the bowels, care must be taken not to break it off, for it will then grow again--it has this peculiar property."</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>2. SECONDLY, Dr. Dowler says: "The subject of this notice is a daughter of Mr. E. <ingredient>Fish,</ingredient> of Beardstown, Ill., about six years old. The only point of special interest in the case consists in the efficiency of the remedy--to me wholly new, and accidentally brought to my notice--which was used in its treatment.</p>
<p>"I was treating a brother of this patient; a part of my 
 
<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=175"/>
prescription for whom was, as a drink, the mucilage of <ingredient>elm bark,</ingredient> made by putting pieces of the solid bark into <ingredient>water.</ingredient> The girl was seen to be frequently eating portions of the bark during the day; the next morning after which, upon my visiting the boy, the mother, with much anxiety, showed me a vessel containing something that had that morning passed the girl's bowels, with bits of the <ingredient>elm bark,</ingredient> enveloped in mucilage, which, upon examination, proved to be about three feet of <purpose>tape-worm.</purpose> As I supposed the passage of the worm was accidental, and had occurred from the looseness caused by the bark, I proceeded to prescribe what I supposed a much more potent anthelmintic, a large dose of turpentine and <ingredient>castor oil.</ingredient> The turpentine and <ingredient>oil</ingredient> were given several times during the three consecutive days, causing pretty active purging, but with no appearance of any portions of the worm. The girl being slender, and of irritable temperment, I was forced to desist from further active medications; and partly to allay irritation of the bowels, and partly to test the influence of the bark on the worm, I directed that she should resume the use of the bark as before, by chewing and swallowing in moderate quantities.</p>
<p>"On visiting her the succeeding morning, I was shown portions of the worm, mostly in separate joints, that had been passed over night. Feeling now some confidence in the <emph rend="italic">anthelmintic</emph> powers of the <ingredient>elm bark,</ingredient> I directed the continued use of it, in the solid form, as before, while there should be any portions of worm passing. In my daily calls for some days, I had the satisfaction to learn that portions of the worm continued to pass, from day to day, and sometimes several times a day.</p>
<p>"I now ceased to visit my little patient, intending only an occasional visit; but my confidence in the efficacy of the <emph rend="italic"><ingredient>elm bark</ingredient></emph> being so well established, I advised its use to be continued for even two or three days after any portions of the worm should be seen in the evacuations. The portions of the worm expelled--even the separate joints--were alive, showing more or less motion; a sense of their presence in the rectum, from their action, seemed to urge the patient to go to stool for their removal.</p>
<p>"Having given direction for the links or joints to be counted, care was taken to do so, by the mother; and from 
 
<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=176"/>
my notes of the case, I find that during about seven weeks of the intervening time, there had been expelled, by estimate, (taking the average lengths of the joints,) about <emph rend="italic">forty-five feet</emph> of worm. At this time there had been no portions of the worm passed for two weeks, during which time the use of the bark had been omitted. The head of the worm, with about fifteen inches of the body attached, had been expelled! But thinking that all portions of the worm or worms might not have been removed, I advised that the patient should resume the use of the bark. Very soon the next day, after doing so, further portions commenced coming away, among them one about <emph rend="italic">six feet</emph> long, tapering to a thread-like termination.</p>
<p>"The next time I took notes of the case, my estimate of the entire length of the worm that had been expelled, footed up <emph rend="italic">one hundred and thirty-five feet,</emph> whether one or more worms, I am unable to say, as in the portions I saw, there were a head and tail, of what I supposed one worm. Since the last estimate, there have been joints occasionally evacuated</p>
<p>"This patient, when first treated, was thin in flesh--had been growing so for some two years--attended with the usual nervous symptoms, starting out of sleep, variable appetite, etc., but with no great departure from good health.</p>
<p>"As to the influence of this very bland agent in the dislodgment of the tape-worm, in this case, I think there can be no doubt, whathever may be the <emph rend="italic">theory</emph> of its action.</p>
<p>"The passage of portions of the worm, so promptly, on the use of the bark, and the ceasing to do so on the discontinuance of its use--even while active purgative anthelmintics were used--leave no room to doubt its effectiveness in at least this case, as a worm-expelling agent.</p>
<p>"It seems probable that the <ingredient>bark,</ingredient> with its thick mucilage, so interposes between the animal and the inner surface of the bowels, as to prevent its lateral grasp on their surface, in consequence of which it is compelled to yield to the forces naturally operating, and is carried out with the discharges. But as my object was simply to state the <emph rend="italic">practical facts</emph> in this case, I will offer no further reflections.</p>

<p>In attacks of cholera, the patient usually feels a general uneasiness and heat about the stomach, increasing to actual distress and great anxiety, finally sickness, with vomiting and purging, surface constringed, the whole powers of the system concentrated upon the internal organs, involving the nervous system, bringing on spasms, and in the end, death. Now, whatever will allay this uneasiness, drive to the surface, correct the discharges, and soothe the nerves, cures the disease. The <ingredient>laudanum</ingredient> does the first and the last, the <ingredient>camphor</ingredient> drives to the surface, and the <ingredient>rhubarb</ingredient> corrects the alimentary canal; and if accompanied with the hot bath, frictions, &#38;c., is doubly sure. And to show what may be done with impunity in extreme cases, let me say that Merritt Blakeley, living near Flat Rock, Mich., came home from Detroit, during the last cholera season, having the cholera in its last stage, that is, with the vomiting, purging and spasms; the foregoing medicine being in the house, the wife, in her hurry and excitement, in place of two-thirds of a table-spoon, she read two-thirds of a <implement>tea-cup;</implement> and gave it accordingly, and saved his life; whilst if taken in the spoon doses, at this stage of the disease, he would most undoubtedly never have rallied from the collapse into which he was fast sinking; yet in the commencement they would have been as effectual; so, <emph rend="italic">mistake,</emph> would be generally accredited for saving the patient, I say <emph rend="italic">Providence</emph> did the work.</p>
<p>Five to 10 drops would be a dose for a child of 2 to 5 years, and in this dose it saved a child of 2 1/2 years in a bad case of bloody flux.</p>
<p>If any one is permitted to die with all these prescriptions before them, it must be because a proper attention is not given; for God most undoubtedly works through the use of means, and is best pleased to see his children <emph rend="italic">wear</emph> out, rather than <emph rend="italic">break</emph> by collision of machinery on the way.</p>

<pb n="181" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=187"/>
--Cholera morbus arises from a diseased condition of the bile, often brought on by over-indulgence with vegetables, especially unripe <ingredient>fruits;</ingredient> usually commencing with sickness and pain at the stomach, followed by the most excruciating pain and griping of the bowels, succeeded by vomiting and purging, which soon prostrate the patient. The person finds himself unavoidably drawn into a coil by the contraction of the muscles of the abdomen and extremities. Thirst very great, evacuations first tinged with bile, and finally, nearly all, very bilious.</p>
<p>TREATMENT.--The difficulty arises from the acidity of the bile: then take <ingredient>saleratus,</ingredient> <ingredient>peppermint leaf,</ingredient> and <ingredient>rhubarb root,</ingredient> pulverized, of each a rounding tea-spoon, put into a cup, which you can cover, and pour upon them, <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> 1/2 pt.; when nearly cold add a table-spoon of <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> or twice as much <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> or other <ingredient>spirits.</ingredient> DOSE.--Two to 3 table-spoons every 20 to 30 minutes, as often and as long as the vomiting and painful purgations continue. If there should be long continued pain about the naval, use the "Injection" as mentioned under that head, in connection with the above treatment, and you will have nothing to fear. If the first dose or two should be vomited repeat it immediately, until retained.</p>
<p>The above preparation ought to be made by every family, and kept on hand, by bottling; for diseases of this character are as liable to come on in the night as at any other time; then much time must be lost in making fires, or getting the articles together with which to make it.</p>

<p>2. <purpose>COMMON CHOLIC.</purpose>--There is a kind of cholic which some persons are afflicted with, from their youth up, not attended with vomiting or purging. I was afflicted with it, from my earliest recollection until I was over twenty years of age, sometimes two or three times, yearly.</p>
<p>In one of these fits, about that age, a neighbor woman came in, and as soon as she found out what was the matter with me, she went out and pulled up a bunch of blue vervain, knocked the dirt from the roots, then cut them off and put a good handful of them into a basin, and poured <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> upon them, and steeped for a short time, poured out a saucer of the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and gave me to drink, asking no questions, but simply saying, "If you will drink this <ingredient>tea</ingredient> every day for a month, you will never have cholic again as long as you live." I drank it, and in 15 minutes I was perfectly happy; the transition from extreme pain to immediate and perfect relief, is too great to allow one to find words adequate to describe the difference.</p>

<p>As a gargle, 1 tea-spoon of the <emph rend="italic"><ingredient>tincture</ingredient></emph> is added to 2 table-spoons of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and gargled <emph rend="italic">every hour</emph> for <emph rend="italic">twenty-four</emph> hours, or till the progress of the disease is arrested; after which the intervals may be extended to an hour and a half, or more, as the symptoms may justify. In connection with the use of the gargle, or separately, the adult patient should take internally to the amount of two or three tea-spoons of the <ingredient>tincture</ingredient> in the course of twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>"In addition to the foregoing, give 10 drops of the muriated <ingredient>tincture of iron</ingredient> 3 times in the 24 hours, and a powder from 3 to 5 grains of the <ingredient>chlorate of potash</ingredient> in the intervals.</p>
<p>"Under this treatment a very decided improvement takes place within the first twenty-four hours, the <ingredient>ash</ingredient> colored

membrane disappears usually within two days, and the patient overcomes the malignant tendency of the disease.</p>
<p>"The foregoing doses are for adults; for children they should of course be diminished according to age, &#38;c. It will be observed that great importance is attached to the frequent use of the gargle-- that is, <emph rend="italic">every hour</emph>--in order to overcome the morbific tendency of disease by a constantly counteracting impression. In order to guard against a relapse, an occasional use of the remedies should be continued for several days after the removal of the membrane and subsidence of unpleasant symptoms. To complete the cure, a generous diet and other restoratives may be used as the intelligent practitioner shall direct."</p>

<p>In the case of an ulcerated tooth at Georgetown, Ohio, Mr. Jenkins, the proprietor of the "Jenkins' House," had been suffering for eight days, and I relieved him by bathing the face with this preparation, using a sponge, for two or three minutes only, taking a tea-spoon or two into the mouth, for a minute or two, as it had broken upon the inside. The operation of the <ingredient>cordial</ingredient> was really <emph rend="italic">magical,</emph> according to <emph rend="italic">old</emph> notions of cure.</p>
<p>I offered to sell a grocer a book, at Lawrenceburgh, Ind.

<p>In passing from Conneatville, Pa., upon a canal boat, the cook, (who was wife of one of the steersmen,) was taken, after supper, with severe pain in the stomach. There being no <ingredient>peppermint</ingredient> on board, and as strange as it may appear, no <ingredient>spirits</ingredient> of any kind whatever; I was applied to as a physician to contrive something for her relief; I ran my mind over the articles I had with me, and could not hit upon any other so likely to benefit as the "Tooth Cordial," arguing in my mind that if good for pain where it could be applied to the spot externally, I could apply it to the point of pain internally in this case, (the stomach,) as well. I gave her a tea-spoon of it in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and waited five minutes without relief, but concluding to go "whole <ingredient>hog</ingredient> or none," I repeated the dose, and inside of the next five minutes she was perfectly cured.

She said she never had toothache after it, nor did it injure the mouth in the least, but, for the moment, she thought her head had collapsed, or the heavens and earth come together. And although the lady's appearance and deportment was such as to gain general esteem, I dared not try it or recommend it to others. But during the last season I found a gentleman who had tried the same thing, in the same way, except he took four spoons in his mouth at a time, and did not observe to keep his mouth closed to prevent the contact of the air with the <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> the result of which was a scalded mouth, yet a perfect cure of the pain and no recurrence of it for twelve years up to the time of conversation.

<p><purpose><alt synonym1="whooping-cough" synonym2="measles">SMALL POX--TO PREVENT PITTING THE FACE.</alt></purpose>--A great discovery is reported to have recently been made by a Surgeon of the English army in China, to prevent pitting or marking of the face. The mode of treatment is as follows:</p>
<p>When, in small pox, the preceding fever is at its height, and just before the eruption appears, the chest is thoroughly rubbed with <ingredient>Croton Oil</ingredient> and Tartaremetic Ointment. This causes the whole of the eruption to appear on that part of the body to the relief of the rest. It also secures a full and complete eruption, and thus prevents the disease from attacking the internal organs. This is said to be now the established mode of treatment in the English army in China, by general orders, and is regarded as perfectly effectual.</p>
 
<pb n="192" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=198"/>
<p>It is a well known fact, that disease is most likely to make its attack upon the weakest parts, and especially upon places in the system which have been recently weakened by previous disease; hence, if an eruption (disease) is caused by the application of croton <ingredient>oil</ingredient> mixed with a little of the Tartaremetic Ointment, there is every reason to believe that the eruption, in Small Pox, will locate upon that part instead of the face. The application should be made upon the breast, fore part of the <ingredient>thighs,</ingredient> &#38;c., not to interfere with the posture upon the bed.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that a similar application will relieve whooping-cough, by drawing the irritation from the lungs; if so, why will it not help to keep measles to the surface, especially when they have a tendency to the internal organs, called, striking in. It is worth a trial, in any of these cases. See "Causes of Inflammation," under the head of "Inflammation."</p>

Age does not injure it, but a skim forms on the top which is to be broken through, using the medicine below it.</p>
<p>This preparation was used for thirty years, with uniform success, by Dr. Jas. Warren, before he gave it to the public; since then, Dr. King, of Cincinnati, author of the <alt synonym1="Eclectic">Ecclectic</alt> Dispensatory, has spread it, through that work, and many lives have been saved by it. It acts by lessening the force of the circulation (sedative power,) as also by its astringent effects in contact with the bleeding vessels. And the probability is that no known remedy can be as safely depended upon for more speedy relief, or certainty of cure, especially for the lungs, stomach, or nose; but for bleedings from the womb, or excessive menstruation, I feel to give preference to Prof. Platt's treatment as shown in the recipe for "Uterine Hemorrhages." No relaxation from business need be required, unless the loss of blood makes it necessary, nor other treatment, except if blood has been swallowed, or if the bleeding is from the stomach, it would be well to give a mild cathartic. Bleeding from the stomach will be distinguished from bleeding from the lungs by a sense of weight, or pain, and unaccompanied by cough, and discharged by vomiting, and in larger quantities at a time than from the lungs. The blood will be darker also, and often mixed with particles of food.</p>
<p>Exercise in the open air is preferable to inactivity; and if any symptoms of returning hemorrhage show themselves, begin with the remedy without loss of time, and a reasonable hope of cure may be expected.</p>

<p>INFLAMMATORY DISEASES--DESCRIPTION.--Before I attempt to speak of the inflammation of particular organs, I shall make a few remarks upon the subject in general,
 
<pb n="196" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=202"/>
which will throw out the necessary light for those not already informed; and I should be glad to extend my treatment to all of the particular organs of the body, but the limits of the work only allows me to speak of Pleurisy, Inflammation of the Lungs, &#38;c.; yet, <emph rend="italic">Eclectic</emph> ideas of inflammation are such, that if we can, successfully, treat inflammation in one part of the system, (body,) we can, with but little modification, succeed with it in all of its forms: And my general remarks shall be of such a nature as to enable any judicious person to, successfully, combat with inflammations in every part of the system. Then:</p>
<p>FIRST.--Inflammation is, generally, attended with <emph rend="italic">pain, increased heat, redness,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">swelling.</emph> Some, or all of these signs <emph rend="italic">always</emph> accompanying it, according to the <emph rend="italic">structure</emph> of the organ affected.</p>
<p>SECOND.--The more loose the structure of the organ, the less severe will be the pain; and the <emph rend="italic">character</emph> of the structure also modifies the character of the <emph rend="italic">pain.</emph> In <emph rend="italic">mucous</emph> membranes, it is burning or stinging. In <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> membranes it is lancinating, and most usually very sharp and cutting. In <emph rend="italic">fibrous</emph> structures, it is dull, aching, and gnawing. In <emph rend="italic">nervous</emph> structures, it is quick, jumping, and most usually excruciatingly severe; and in nearly all structures more or less soreness is soon present.</p>
<p>THIRD.--To make the foregoing information of value, it becomes necessary to <emph rend="italic">know</emph> the structure of the various parts of the system. Although the ultimate portions of muscle or flesh, as usually called, is fibrous, yet, there is a <emph rend="italic">loose cellular</emph> structure blended with it, which fills up and rounds the form to its graceful beauty--hence, here, we have more swelling, and less severity of pain. With the rose, or red of the lips, commences the <emph rend="italic">mucous</emph> membrane, which forms the lining coat of the mouth, stomach, &#38;c., through the whole alimentary canal, also lining the urethra, bladder, ureters, vagina, womb, fallopian tubes, &#38;c., hence the heat always felt in inflammation of these organs. The whole internal surface of the cavity of the body is lined by a <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> membrane, which is also reflected or folded upon the lungs--here called <emph rend="italic">pleura,</emph> (the side,) hence pleurisy, (inflammation of the pleura or side,) and also folded upon
 
<pb n="197" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=203"/>
the upper side of the diaphragm forming a partition between the upper and lower portions of the cavity of the body, the upper portion containing the lungs, heart, large blood vessels, &#38;c., called the <emph rend="italic">chest,</emph> more commonly the breast--the lower portion containing the stomach, liver, kidneys, intestines, bladder, &#38;c., called the <emph rend="italic">abdomen</emph>--more commonly the bowels. The sides of the abdomen are covered with a continuation of this <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> membrane, which is also reflected upon the lower side of the diaphragm, liver, small and large intestines, bladder, &#38;c.,--here called <emph rend="italic">peritoneum,</emph> (to extend around) in all places it secretes (furnishes) a moistening fluid enabling one organ of the body to move upon itself or other organs without friction. This serous membrane is thin, but very firm, hence the sharpness of the pain when it is inflamed, as it cannot yield to the pressure of the accumulating blood.</p>
<p>FOURTH.--The ligaments or bands which bind the different parts of the body together at the joints, and the gracefully contracted ends of the muscles (called tendons) which pass the joint, attaching themselves to the next bone above, or below, and the wristlet-like bands which are clasped around the joints through which these tendons play, as over a pully, when the joint is bent, are all of a <emph rend="italic">fibrous</emph> construction, hence the grinding or gnawing pains of rheumatism (inflammations), and injuries of, or near joints; and it also accounts for that kind of pain in the latter stages of intestinal inflammations, as the stomach, intestines, &#38;c., are composed of three coats, the external, serous,--middle fibrous, internal, mucous; and when inflammation of the external, or internal; coats are <emph rend="italic">long</emph> continued, it generally involves the middle-fibrous layer.</p>
<p>FIFTH.--The greatest portion of the substance of the lungs is of <emph rend="italic">fibrous</emph> tissue, consequently, dull or obtuse pain only, is experienced when inflamed.</p>
<p>LASTLY.--The nervous system, although of a <emph rend="italic">fibrous</emph> character is so indescribably fine in its <emph rend="italic">structure,</emph> that, like the telegraph wire, as soon as touched, it answers with a bound, to the call--quick as thought, whether pain or pleasure, jumping, bounding, it goes to the grand citadel (the brain) which overlooks the welfare of the whole temple.</p>
 
<pb n="198" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=204"/>
<p>In general, the intensity of the pain attending inflammations will surely indicate the violence of the febrile (sympathetic) reaction; for instance, in inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the pain is not very severe, consequently not much fever, (reaction); but in inflammation of the pleura (pleurisy) the pain is very severe, conse quently the febrile reaction exceedingly great.</p>
<p>CAUSES OF INFLAMMATION.--In health, the <emph rend="italic">blood</emph> is carried evenly, in proportion to the size of the blood vessels, to every part of the body. And the vessels (arteries and veins) are proportioned in size to the necessity of the system for vitality, nutrition, and reparation. Whatever it may be that causes the blood to <emph rend="italic">recede</emph> from the surface, or any considerable portion of it, will cause inflammation of the weakest portion of the system; and whatever will draw the blood unduly to any part of the system, will cause inflammation of that part,--for instance, cold drives the blood from the surface, consequently, if sufficiently long continued, the internal organ least able to bear the accumulation of blood upon it will be excited to inflammation--a blow upon any part, if sufficiently severe, will cause inflammation of the injured part. Also mustard poultices, drafts to the feet, &#38;c., hence the propriety of their proper use to draw the blood away from internal organs which are inflamed. A check of perspiration is, especially, liable to excite inflammation, and that in proportion to the degree of heat producing the perspiration and the length of time which the person may be exposed to the cold. The object of knowing the cause of disease is to avoid suffering from disease, by keeping clear of its cause; or thereby to know what remedy to apply for its cure or relief.</p>
<p>There is a class of persons who claim that <emph rend="italic">causes</emph> will have their legitimate <emph rend="italic">effects, physical</emph> or <emph rend="italic">moral;</emph> physicians <emph rend="italic">know</emph> that it is absurd physically; that is, when philosophically and scientifically combated with,--for instance, a person is exposed to cold; the blood is driven in upon the internal organs, and the one which is the least able to bear the pressure gives way before the invading enemy, and an inflammation is the result; which, if left to itself, will terminate in death; but heat and moisture are applied to the constringed surface--the blood is brought back and held there, and a
 
<pb n="199" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=205"/>
cure is speedily effected--the natural or physical <emph rend="italic">effect</emph> of the cause is <emph rend="italic">obviated</emph> or avoided.</p>
<p>Then why should it be thought impossible with God that a <emph rend="italic">moral</emph> remedy should be provided against moral evils? Thanks be to God, it has been provided to the <emph rend="italic">willing</emph> and <emph rend="italic">obedient,</emph> through our Lord Jesus Christ, but <emph rend="italic">only</emph> to the willing and obedient, morally as well as physically, for if a person <emph rend="italic">will not</emph> permit a proper course to be pursued to overcome the consequences arising to his body from cold, he <emph rend="italic">must</emph> suffer, not only the inflammation to go on, but also guilt of mind for neglecting his known duty. The same is true in either point of view, only it looks so curious that there should be those who can reason of physical things, but utterly refuse to give up their moral blindness; the consequences be upon their own heads.</p>
<p>Just in proportion to the susceptibility of an organ to take on diseased action, is the danger of exposure; for example, if a person has had a previous attack of pleurisy, or inflammation of the lungs, those organs, or the one which has been diseased, will be almost certain to be <emph rend="italic">again</emph> prostrated, usually called <emph rend="italic">relapse;</emph> which is in most cases, <emph rend="italic">ten times</emph> more severe than the first attack; then be <emph rend="italic">very</emph> careful about exposures when just getting better from these, or other disease.</p>
<p>Inflammation terminates by <emph rend="italic">resolution, effusion, suppuration, or mortification.</emph> By <emph rend="italic">resolution,</emph> is meant that the parts return to their <emph rend="italic">natural</emph> condition; by <emph rend="italic">effusion,</emph> that <emph rend="italic">blood</emph> may be thrown out from the soft parts, or from <emph rend="italic">mucous membranes,</emph>--that <emph rend="italic">lymph,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">serum,</emph> a colorless part of the blood may be thrown out by <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> membranes, which often form adhesions, preventing the after motions of the affected parts--and here what wisdom is brought to light, in the fact that whatever is thrown out from the <emph rend="italic">mucus</emph> surface never, or at least <emph rend="italic">very</emph> seldom adhere, or grow up; if it did, any part of the alimentary canal from the mouth to the stomach, and so on through the intestines, would be constantly adhering; so, also of the lungs; for these various organs are more frequently affected by inflammations than any other parts of the body--by <emph rend="italic">suppuration,</emph> when <emph rend="italic">abscesses</emph> are formed containing pus (matter,) or this may take place upon the surface, when it is usually called canker, or corroding ulcers, cancers, &#38;c.; by <emph rend="italic">gangrene,</emph> (mortification,) when death of
 
<pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=206"/>
the parts take place; in this case, if the part is sufficiently extensive, or if it is an internal part, death of the whole body, if not relieved, is the result.</p>
<p>The methods of inflammatory termination is believed to result from the grade of inflammation--for instance, at the circumference of a boil, the inflammation is weak, <emph rend="italic">serum</emph> is thrown out; near the centre, where the inflammation is a little higher, <emph rend="italic">lymph</emph> is poured out and adhesion takes place;--next <emph rend="italic">pus</emph>--at the centre, <emph rend="italic">mortification</emph> and consequent sloughing takes place.</p>
<p>In <emph rend="italic">boils,</emph> the tendency is to suppuration; in <emph rend="italic">carbuncles,</emph> the tendency is to mortification; but in rheumatism, mumps, &#38;c., there is a strong tendency to resolution; and it is often very difficult to avoid these natural terminations.</p>
<p>The five different tissues of the body also modify the inflammation according to the tissue inflamed, viz: the <emph rend="italic">cellular</emph> (fleshy) tissue, is characterized by great swelling, throbbing pain, and by its suppurating in cavities--not spreading all over that tissue. Inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> tissue, has sharp lancinating pain, scarcely any swelling, but much reaction (fever), throws out lymph, and is very liable to form adhesion--not likely to terminate in mortification, except in peritonitis (inflammation of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity), which sometimes terminates thus in a few hours, showing the necessity of immediate action. Inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">mucous</emph> tissue, is characterized by burning heat, or stinging pain (hence the heat of the stomach, bowels, &#38;c.)--without swelling, not much febrile reaction, and never terminates in resolution (health) without a copious discharge of mucus, as from the nose and lungs, in colds, catarrhs, coughs, &#38;c. Inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">dermoid</emph> (skin) tissue, as in erysipelas, is characterized by burning pain--spreads irregularly over the surface, forming blisters containing a yellowish serum, but never forms adhesions, nor suppurates in cavities, but upon the surface. Inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">fibrous</emph> tissue, or rheumatic inflammation, is characterized by severe aching or gnawing pain--is not liable to terminate in suppuration nor mortification--nearly always throwing out a gelatinous serum, often causing stiff-joints, or depositing earthy matter, as in gout--is peculiarly liable to change its place, being very dangerous if it changes
 
<pb n="201" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=207"/>
to any of the vital organs, as the brain, heart, stomach, &#38;c., and in the acute form the febrile reaction is usually quite severe. <emph rend="italic">Internal</emph> inflammation will be known by the constant pain of the inflamed part, by the presence of fever, which does not generally attend a spasmodic or nervous pain, and by the position chosen by the patient, to avoid pressure upon the afflicted organs.</p>
<p>Inflammation is known under two heads, <emph rend="italic">acute</emph> and <emph rend="italic">chronic.</emph> The first is generally rapid and violent in its course and characteristics. The last is usually the result of the first,--is more slow and less dangerous in its consequences.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>TREATMENT.--Sound philosophy (Eclecticism) teaches, that if cold has driven the blood (consequently the heat) from the surface, heat will draw it back; and thus relieve the internal engorgements (over-full organs) and if held there, sufficiently long, entirely cure the difficulty (<purpose>inflammation</purpose>); upon the same ground, if a person is cold, warm him; if wet and cold, warm and dry him; if hot, cool him; if dry and hot, wet and cool him--equalize the circulation and pain or disease cannot exist.</p>
</formula>
<p>The foregoing remarks must suffice for general directions; but the following special application to <emph rend="italic">pleurisy</emph> and <emph rend="italic">inflammation of the lungs</emph> shall be sufficiently explicit to enable all to make their <emph rend="italic">general</emph> applications.</p>
<subsection class1="medhealth">
<p>2. PLEURISY.--Pleurisy is an inflammation of the <emph rend="italic">serous</emph> membrane inveloping (covering) the lungs, which is also reflected (folded) upon the parieties (sides or walls) of the chest, (but I trust all will make themselves familiar with the description of "Inflammation in General," before they proceed with the study of pleurisy,) attended with sharp lancinating pain in the side, difficult breathing, fever, with a quick, full, and hard pulse, usually commencing with a chill. In many cases the inflammation, consequently the pain, is confined to one point, most commonly about the short ribs; but often gradually extends towards the shoulder and forward part of the breast; the pain increasing, and often becoming very violent. It may not, but usually, is attended with cough, and the expectoration is seldom mixed with blood, or very free, but rather of a glairy or mucous character. As the disease advances, the pain is compared to a stab with a sharp instrument, full breathing
 
<pb n="202" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=208"/>
not being indulged, from its increasing the difficulty; the cough also aggravates the pain; great prostration of strength, the countenance expressing anxiety and suffering. The breathing is short, hurried, and catching, to avoid increase of pain; in some cases, the cough is only slight. It may be complicated with inflammation of the lungs, or bronchial tubes, and if so complicated, the expectoration will be mixed or streaked with blood. Yet it makes but very little difference, as the treatment is nearly the same--with the exception of expectorants, quite the same; although expectorants are not <emph rend="italic">amiss</emph> in pleurisy, but absolutely <emph rend="italic">necessary</emph> in inflammation of the lungs. Even Mackintosh, of the "Regulars," says: "It must be recollected that pneumonia" (inflammation of the lungs) "and pleuritis" (pleurisy) "Frequently co-exist" (exist together); "But neither is that circumstance of much consequence, being both inflammatory diseases, and requiring the same general remedies." But there I stop with him, for I cannot go the bleeding, calomel, and antimony. I have quoted his words to satisfy the people that the "Regulars" acknowledge the necessity of a similar treatment in all inflammatory diseases, the <emph rend="italic">difference</emph> between the two branches of the profession, existing only in the <emph rend="italic">remedies</emph> used.</p>
<p>CAUSES OF PLEURISY.--Cold, long applied, constringes (makes smaller) the capillaries (hair-like blood-vessels) which cover as a net-work the whole surface, impairing the circulation, driving the blood internally, causing congestion (an unnatural accumulation of blood) upon the pleura, hence pleurisy. Exposures to rains, especially cold rains, cold, wet feet, recession (striking in) of measles, scarlet fever, rheumatism, &#38;c., often cause inflammation of this character.</p>
<p>INDICATIONS.--Relax the whole surface, which removes the obstructions--restore, and maintain, an equal circulation, and the work is accomplished. The temperature of the surface and extremities is much diminished, showing that the blood has receded (gone) to the internal, diseased, organs, the temperature of which is much increased; for with the blood goes the vitality (heat) of the body. This condition of the system clearly indicates the treatment, viz: the application of heat to the surface in such a way as to be
 
<pb n="203" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=209"/>
able to keep it there until nature is again capable of carrying on her own work, in her own way.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>TREATMENT.--It has been found that the quickest and least troublesome way in which heat could be applied to the whole surface, is by means of burning <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> formerly called a "<ingredient>Rum</ingredient> sweat," because <ingredient>rum</ingredient> was stronger than at present, and more plenty than <ingredient>alcohol;</ingredient> but now <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> is the most plenty, and much the strongest and cheapest. It should always be in the house (the 98 per cent.) ready for use as described under the head of "Sweating with Burning <ingredient>Alcohol,</ingredient>" (which see), or if it is day time, and fires are burning, you can give the vapor-bath-sweat, by placing a pan, half or two-thirds full of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> under the chair, having a comforter around you; then putting into it occasionally a hot stone or brick, until a free perspiration is produced and held for from 15 to 30 minutes, according to the severity of the case; and if this is commenced as soon as the attack is fairly settled upon the patient, in not more than one case out of ten will it be necessary to do anything more; but if fairly established, or if of a day or two's standing, then, at the same time you are administering the <emph rend="italic">sweat,</emph> place the patient's feet in <ingredient>water</ingredient> as hot as it can be borne; have also a strong <ingredient>tea</ingredient> made of equal parts of <ingredient>pleurisy-root</ingredient> and <ingredient>catnip,</ingredient> (this root is also called <ingredient>white</ingredient> root--Doctors call it asclepias tuberosa)--into a saucer of this hot <ingredient>tea</ingredient> put 2 tea-spoons of the "Sweating Drops," drinking all at one time, repeating the dose every hour for 5 or 6 hours, using only 1 tea-spoon of the drops at other times, except the first, giving the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> freely once or twice between doses. As soon as the sweating is over, place the patient comfortably in bed so as to keep up the perspiration from 6 to 12 hours, or until the pain and uneasiness yield to the treatment. If necessary, after the patient takes the bed, place bottles of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to the feet and along the sides, or hot bricks, or stones wrapped with <implement>flannel</implement> wet with <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> to help keep up the perspiration. <ingredient>Mustard</ingredient> may also be placed over the seat of pain, and upon the <ingredient>feet,</ingredient> also rubbing the arms and <ingredient>legs</ingredient> with dry <implement>flannel,</implement> which very much aids the process when the attack is severe. If the pain <emph rend="italic">continues</emph> severe, and perspiration is hard to maintain, steep <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> or common <ingredient>red peppers</ingredient> in <ingredient>spirits</ingredient> and rub the whole surface with it, well and long, and I will assure the blood to come out soon and see what is going on externally. Keep the patient well covered all the time, and avoid drafts of cold air. As the painful symptoms begin to subside, the doses of medicine may be lessened, and the time between doses lengthened, until the disease is fairly under control; then administer a dose of the "Vegetable Physic," or some other cathartic, if preferred, or if that is not at hand, this course may be repeated or modified to meet returning or changing symptoms.</p>
<p>Wetting the surface daily, with <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> equal parts, will be found an excellent assistant in treating any disease, especially, internal inflammations, as <purpose>Pleurisy, Inflammation of the <alt synonym1="Lungs,">Lunge,</alt> Consumpton, Bronchits, &#38;c., &#38;c.</purpose></p>

<p>The <ingredient>pleurisy root</ingredient> is almost a specific in pleurisy or inflammation of the <ingredient>lungs;</ingredient> no other known root or <ingredient>herb</ingredient> is equal to it for producing and keeping up perspiration (druggists usually keep it,) but if it cannot be got, <ingredient>pennyroyal,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> &#38;c., or one of the <ingredient>mints,</ingredient> must be used in its place. The only objection to the foregoing treatment is this, the Doctors say:</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">Heigh! I guess he wasn't very sick;<lb/>For see! he's round in "double quick";<lb/>But alopath holds'em for weeks, six or seven,<lb/>When bleeding, calomel, and antimony are given.</p>
<p>To illustrate: I awoke one night with severe pain in the left side (I had been exposed to cold during the afternoon,) could not move or draw a full breath without very much increasing the difficulty; the night was cold and fires all down; I studied my symptoms for a few minutes, and also reflected upon the length of time which must elapse, if I waited for fires to be built; then awoke my wife, saying do not be frightened, I have an attack of Pleurisy; you will get me a comforter, saucer, and the <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> and return to bed without disturbing any one; with persuasion, or almost compulsion, she did so; for she desired to build a fire and make a more thorough work of it; but I had made up my mind and resolved to carry out the experiment upon myself, and now had the only chance. I arose and poured the saucer nearly full of <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> and set it on fire; wrapping the comforter around me, I sat down upon the chair, over it, and continued to sit until the <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> was all burned out, and I in a most profuse perspiration; the pain and difficult breathing having nearly all subsided; I then returned to bed, the perspiration continuing for some considerable longer, by retaining the comforter around me to avoid checking it as I returned to bed, during which time I again fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I could just realize a little pain, or rather uneasiness, upon taking a full breath, but did nothing more, being very careful about exposure however, through the day; but at bed time I took another <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> sweat, and that was the last of the pleurisy.</p>
<p>Again: Mr. -----, a medical student rooming in the same house where I lived, awoke in the night, attacked with pleurisy, the same as myself, after exposure; but as he was attending the lectures of alopathic professors, of
 
<pb n="205" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=211"/>
course, he must have one of them to attend him; one was called, three pints of blood were taken, calomel and antimony were freely given; and in about three or four days the disease gave way to time, or the treatment; but a calomel-Diarrhea set in, and came very near terminating his life, and kept him from college and his studies over six weeks; and he said if he was ever calomelized again, he would prosecute the doer to the end of his life; but he graduated in that school of medicine, and no doubt is now expecting to go and do the same thing. Choose ye your <emph rend="italic">servant.</emph> Shall he be reason, with common-sense results, or shall he be silver-slippered fashion, with his health-destroying policy? It need not be argued that these were not parallel cases, for I had the pleurisy when young, and was treated in the fashionable style, and was constantly liable to, and had frequent attacks of it during my earlier life.</p>
<p><variation>In chronic cases, which sometimes occur, and frequently under other treatment, it will be necessary, not only to use the foregoing treatment, but to add to it an emetic about once a week, alternating with the sweating process, with much external friction, occasionally, with the <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>spirits</ingredient> to hold the blood to the surface.</variation></p>
<p>Since the first publication of the foregoing, I have seen a statement going the rounds of the "<ingredient>Papers,</ingredient>" that a bad case of burning had taken place in N.Y., by the <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> process of sweating, calling it <emph rend="italic">new;</emph> but it has been in use more than <emph rend="italic">forty</emph> years; I have used it, I speak safely, more than a <emph rend="italic">hundred</emph> times, and never before heard of its injuring any one; but still it is possible that some accident may have occurred in its use, or that some one has undertaken it who was not capable of prescribing; but if <emph rend="italic">calomel</emph> could claim <emph rend="italic">one</emph> year's use under its most accomplished prescribers with only one case of <emph rend="italic">injury,</emph> I would say, let it be continued; but in place of one, it is <emph rend="italic">hundreds;</emph> farther comment is unnecessary.</p>
<p><variation>But, those who prefer, or from the absence of <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> or other necessities, can take "grandmother's plan," <emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> place the feet into <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> and drink freely of <ingredient>pennyroyal,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> or other hot <ingredient>teas,</ingredient> for fifteen to twenty minutes; then get into bed, continuing the <ingredient>teas</ingredient> for a short time, remaining in bed for a few hours; which, if commenced soon after the

<p>3. INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS--Is usually, by physicians, called Pneumonia, from the Greek, <emph rend="italic">Pneumon,</emph> the Lungs. It may involve the whole lung, on one or both sides, but is more generally confined to one side, and to the lower portion, than to the whole lung.</p>
<p>CAUSES.--Exposure to cold, wet, cold feet, drafts of air, especially if in a perspiration, recession of eruptive diseases, &#38;c., and consequently more liable to come on in the winter, or cold wet changes of spring, than at any other time; and upon those whose lungs are debilitated by previous attacks, or are predisposed to, or actually suffering under disease.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS.--Inflammation of the Lungs, like other diseases of an inflammatory character, nearly always commences with a chill, soon followed by fever, more or less violent, according to which, the severity of the case may be somewhat predetermined, unless of a congestive character; in which case, instead of a hot and fevered surface, there will be a cold, clammy feel to the hand, as well as unpleasant to the patient. There will be difficulty in taking full breaths, as well as an increased number of breaths to the minute, which in healthy persons is generally about twenty. Dull pain, with a tightness of the chest, short and perpetual hacking cough, scanty expectoration, which is tough, and sticks to the vessel used as a spittoon, and is more or less streaked with blood, or more like iron-rust in color, and may have so much blood in it as to make it a brighter red. The pulse is variable, so much so that but little confidence can be placed in it. The tongue soon becomes dry and dark; but a dry and glossy tongue, with early delirium, are considered dangerous symptoms, that is, under "Old School treatment." But with our rational treatment we very seldom have a fatal termination, yet it is occasional, and really wonderful that it is not more frequent, when we take into account the neglect of some physicians and imprudence of many patients.</p>
 
<pb n="207" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=213"/>
<p>INDICATIONS.--As the blood has receded from the surface and centered upon the lungs; the indications are to return it to its original vessels, by judiciously applying heat and moisture, which is sure to relax their constringed condition, instead of cutting a hole and letting it run <emph rend="italic">out</emph> (bleeding), which prostrates the patient and retards his recovery.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>TREATMENT.--The treatment of <purpose><alt synonym1="pneumonia">Inflammation of the Lungs</alt></purpose>in recent cases, will be, at first, the same as for "Pleurisy," that is, to produce free perspiration--soak the feet in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> while administering the "<ingredient>Alcohol</ingredient> Sweat," or Vapor Bath, as there directed, with the <ingredient>white-root</ingredient> <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and "Sweating Drops," for several hours, with bottles of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> or hot bricks to the feet and sides, <ingredient>mustard-drafts</ingredient> to the feet also, as they can be borne; and after 6 or 8 hours, the "Vegetable," or other cathartic should be administered, and great care not to expose the patient to drafts of air during its operation, especially if in perspiration. If this course is faithfully persevered in, it will call the blood to the surface--prevent congestion of the lungs (unnatural accumulation of blood)--lessen the fever--ease the pain and aid expectoration. But if the expectoration becomes difficult, and the disease should not seem to yield in from 8 to 12 hours at farthest, or by the time the cathartic has freely operated, then, or soon after, give the "Eclectic," or "<ingredient>Lobelia-seed</ingredient> Emetic," as directed under that head; and if called to a case which is already confirmed, it is best to <emph rend="italic">begin</emph> with the emetic, then follow up as above directed in recent cases. An expectorant, in confirmed (established) cases will be needed--let it be composed of <ingredient>tincture of lobelia</ingredient> 1 oz.; <ingredient>tincture of ipecac</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>tincture of blood-root</ingredient> 1/4 oz.; simple <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> or <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 2 ozs.; mix. DOSE--One teaspoon every 2 hours, alternately with the <ingredient>white-root tea</ingredient> and "Sweating Drops," except the first dose may be 2 tea-spoons.

<p>FEMALE DEBILITY AND IRREGULARITIES.--It is a self-evident fact that the finer the work, and the more complicated a piece of machinery, the more liable is it to become deranged, or out of order; and the more skillful must be the mechanic who undertakes to make any necessary repairs.</p>
<p>Upon this consideration I argue that the system of the <emph rend="italic">female</emph> is the finer and more complicated, having to perform a double work, (child-bearing), yet confined to the same or less dimensions than the male. And to perform this <emph rend="italic">double</emph> function of sustaining her own life, and giving life to her species; it becomes necessary in the wisdom of God to give her such a peculiar formation, that between the ages of fourteen and forty-five, or the child-bearing period, she should have a sanguineous (blood-like) monthly discharge from the organs of generation, known under the various names of monthly sickness, menses, catamenia, courses, menstruation, &#38;c. Why it should have been so arranged, or necessary, none can tell. We are left to deal with the simple fact; and it would be just as wise in us to say that it was <emph rend="italic">not</emph> so, as to say there was no one which <emph rend="italic">planned</emph> it, or any other thing, because we cannot see and fully understand the great first cause. The blood discharged usually amounts to from four to six ounces, and should continue only from four to five days. And as this book will fall to very many families who will have no other medical work for reference upon this subject, it will not be amiss for me to give the necessary instructions here that all may be able to qualify themselves to meet the exigencies (demand) of
 
<pb n="209" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=215"/>
all cases. Previous to menstruation, pain or uneasiness is felt in the back, loins, thighs, and a sense of heaviness in the womb, which lies in the lower part of the abdomen. Some are very nervous at these periods, others with flushed face, accompanied with dizziness and headache, sickness at the stomach, &#38;c. In young girls these new feelings produce uneasiness, for want of knowledge as to their cause and result, and should lead them to seek maternal advice and council, unless they have some book of this kind which explains the whole matter. The breasts, at this period, enlarge and often become the seat of uneasiness, or actual pain. Let no real danger be apprehended; for these unpleasant sensations will continue until in healthy young females there will be a few drops of reddish fluid, resembling blood, pass from the genital organs, affording immediate relief, not from its quantity, but from the accomplishment of their natural work. Owing to their better general health, which is improved by the style of living, some girls menstruate a few months, or a year perhaps, earlier than others. When they take an active part in the labors of the house, freely romping, playing, &#38;c., their health and strength becomes fully developed and menstruation comes on a little earlier, and is more healthy and regular.</p>
<p>Allow me here to give a word of caution about taking cold at this period. It is very dangerous. I knew a young girl, who had not been properly instructed by her mother upon this subject, to be so afraid or ashamed of being found with stains upon her clothes which she did not know the meaning of, that she went to a brook and washed herself and clothes--took cold and immediately became <emph rend="italic">insane</emph>--remaining so as long as I knew her. Any mother who so neglects her duty to her child, in not explaining these things, is verily guilty.</p>
<p>After this discharge takes place, the unpleasant feelings usually subside, and the health again becomes good for the month, when all of the foregoing sensations recur again, with a larger flow and longer continued, recurring every four weeks, and is then called menses or monthly courses.</p>
<p>This function of the female system, from the fineness and complication of the structures is very liable to become deranged in various ways.</p>
 
<pb n="210" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=216"/>
<p>It may be entirely stopped, called <emph rend="italic">amenorrhea</emph> (green sickness, suppression of the menses, &#38;c.,)--it may become painful and imperfect (<emph rend="italic">dysmenorrhea</emph>)--it may be very free or excessive <emph rend="italic">(menorrhagia),</emph> like hemorrhage; or it may be irregular in its recurrence and duration (leucorrhea.)</p>
<p>But as this monthly discharge is absolutely necessary to health, between these periods of life--its suppression,--painfulness--excessive flow, or irregularity, will soon produce general female debility.</p>
<p>CAUSES.--The female organism is such that what affects the general system of the male, much more frequently affects the organs peculiar to <emph rend="italic">her</emph> system only. No reason can be given for it except the wisdom of the Creator, or the necessities of her construction. But this <emph rend="italic">debility</emph> and <emph rend="italic">irregularity</emph> are so interwoven together that what causes one must necessarily affect the other.</p>
<p>In the good old <emph rend="italic">grandmother-days,</emph> of girls helping with the work of the household; warm but loose clothing, plain food, good thick-soled shoes, and absence of novels to excite sexual thoughts, &#38;c., such a thing as a feeble, debilitated woman or girl was hardly known; but now sedentary habits, stimulating food, every conceivable unphysiological style of dress, paper-soled shoes, checking perspiration, excitable reading, repeated colds by exposure going to and from parties thinly clad, standing out talking with supposed friends (real enemies) when they ought to be by the fire or in bed, masturbation, excessive co-habitation, miscarriages, &#38;c., all tend to general debility; and the real wonder is that there are so few cases.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS.--The very word <emph rend="italic">debility,</emph> shows plainly the leading symptom, weakness. She appears pale, especially about the ears, lips, nose, &#38;c., with a bluish circle about the eyes, which appear rather sunken from the fact that the countenance is generally bloated, leading her friends to feel not over-anxious about her, supposing her to be in good health, as she still appears in good flesh; but if you take hold of it, it will be found soft and flabby; she feels dull, languid, and drowsy, stomach out of order, nausea, often with fluttering about the heart; the nervous system sometimes becoming so much involved as to bring on fits of despondency leading many to attempt, and occasionally succeed
 
<pb n="211" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=217"/>
in taking their own lives. The feet and limbs may become swollen, restless in sleep, often craving unnatural food, as clay, soft stones, tea-grounds, &#38;c. There may be a discharge, from these organs, of a glairy or whitish fluid, resembling the white of an egg, the disease taking the name, in this complication of <emph rend="italic">Whites, fluor albus</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Leucorrhea,</emph> &#38;c.; it is more common amongst married females, but often occurs before marriage. There may also be a sensation of bearing down, or even falling of the womb (prolapsus uteri) which is much the most common also amongst the married. The bowels usually costive, but often griping pains which cause much suffering. Pains may occasionally be experienced in the head and back; but instead of being looked upon as unfavorable, they rather show that nature is trying to bring about the natural discharge, and needs the assistance of <emph rend="italic">rational</emph> remedies.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that every patient will experience all of these symptoms, at one, or all of the time; but they commence as pointed out, and if allowed to go on without proper correction, they will increase in severity until they may be all experienced in a greater or less degree.</p>
<p>INDICATIONS.--The symptoms indicate (point out) the treatment, that is, if there is debility, tonics are required; paleness shows that the blood has left the surface and must be brought back by heat, friction, &#38;c. The softness of the flesh indicate a more nutritious diet. The dullness and drowsy languidness indicate active exercise. Stomach and heart indicate an alternative cathartic. The nerves require soothing and quieting remedies, travel, agreeable company, &#38;c., to draw the mind away from self. The glairy mucus discharge, indicates an inflammation, and calls for washings of the parts by cooling and astringent injections, both as an act of cleanliness, as also of cure. The falling of the womb, points out the necessity of a pessary support, until the general treatment relieves the difficulty. Costiveness, points out laxatives, whilst nature's efforts, shown by pains in the head, back, &#38;c., clearly indicate the whole general remedies above pointed out; and which shall be a little more particularized in the following:</p>

<p>If any female, into whose hands this book shall come, will carefully study and use the foregoing rational remarks and prescriptions, and is not an hundred times better pleased with the results than she would have been by calling half the physicians of the day, I should be very much disappointed, and I would be sure that the remedies did not have their common effects; which I feel will not be the case from the great good they have, many times, already done; besides, they save the delicacy of exposures, in many instances, and always save the delicacy of conversing with and explaining their various feelings and conditions, to one of the opposite sex. So highly important is this fact, and that the information should become general, every girl over thirteen years of age ought to be furnished with one of Dr. Chase's books.</p>
<p>Should <emph rend="italic">married</emph> Ladies wish to consult a physician upon subjects not here introduced, they can do so by addressing a letter to Dr. Chase, Ann Arbor, Mich., Box 600, writing the word <emph rend="italic">Private</emph> upon the envelope, which will show the Clerk that it is to be opened <emph rend="italic">only</emph> by myself.

<p>COLORS--<purpose>BEST COLOR FOR BOOT, SHOE, AND HARNESS EDGE, AND INK WHICH CANNOT FREEZE.</purpose>--<ingredient>Alcohol</ingredient> 1 pt.; <ingredient>tincture</ingredient> of iron 1 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>extract of logwood</ingredient> 1 oz.; <ingredient>nutgalls,</ingredient> pulverized, 1 oz.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 1/2 pt.; mix.

<p>I have found shoemakers using these <purpose>colors,</purpose>each thinking he had the best color in the world. The <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> is believed to prevent the hot iron from sticking, and to make a better polish.</p>
<p>The first one makes a very passable ink for <emph rend="italic">winter</emph> use, by carrying a quick hand to prevent it from spreading in the <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> from the presence of the <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> which, of course, is what prevents it from freezing, and that is the only argument in favor of it as an ink for writing purposes.</p>

<p>8. SOME, however, may prefer the following <purpose>manner of preserving their boots and shoes,</purpose>from a correspondent of the <attribution rend="italic">Mechanics' Gazette;</attribution> but if they do the boots must be made large, from the fact that the preparation has a tendency to shrink the leather. He says: "I have had only three pair of boots for the last six years, (no shoes) and I think I shall not require any more the next six years to come. The reason is, that I treat them in the following manner:</p>
<p>"I put 1 lb. of <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> and 1/2 pound of rosin in a pot on the fire; when melted and mixed, I warm the boots and apply the hot stuff with a painter's brush until neither the <emph rend="italic"><ingredient>sole</ingredient> nor the upper</emph> will soak in any more.

<p>"Thus the exterior will have a coat of wax alone, and will shine like a mirror. <ingredient>Tallow</ingredient> or any other <ingredient>grease</ingredient> becomes rancid, and rots the stitching as well as the leather, but the <ingredient>rosin</ingredient> gives it that antiseptic quality which <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> the whole.

<formula class="farmgarden">
<p><purpose>TANNING, BLACKING, AND FINISHING.--PROCESS FOR CALF, KIP, AND HARNESS, IN FROM SIX TO THIRTY DAYS.</purpose>--For a 12 lb. <ingredient>calf skin,</ingredient> take <ingredient>terra-japonica </ingredient>3 lbs.; <ingredient>common salt</ingredient> 2 lbs.; <ingredient>alum</ingredient> 1 lb.; put these into a copper kettle with sufficient <ingredient>water</ingredient> to dissolve the whole by boiling.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> or <ingredient>skins,</ingredient> will first be limed, haired, and treated in every way as for the old process; then it will be put into a vessel with sufficient <ingredient>water</ingredient> to cover it, at which time you will put in one pint of the composition, stirring it well; adding the same amount each night and morning for three days, when you will add the whole; handling two or three times daily all the time tanning; you can continue to use the tanning liquid by adding half the quantity each time, of new liquor, and by keeping these proportions for any amount, and if you desire to give the leather the appearance of bark color, you will put in one pound of Sicily sumac.</p>
<p>Kip <ingredient>skins</ingredient> will require about twenty days, light horse hides for harness, thirty days, to make good leather, while
 
<pb n="218" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=224"/>
<ingredient>calf skins</ingredient> will only require from six to ten days at most. The <ingredient>japonica</ingredient> is put up in large cakes of about one hundred and fifty pounds, and sells, in common times, at about four cents per pound, in New York.</p>
<p><attribution>BYRON ROSE, a tanner, of Madison, O.,</attribution> says that one quart of <ingredient>oil of vitriol</ingredient> to fifty sides of leather, with the <ingredient>japonica</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> as above, leaving out the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> will very much improve it; the acid opens the pores, quickening the process without injury to the leather.</p>

<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>2. <purpose><alt synonym1="tanning">CANADIAN PROCESS.</alt></purpose>--The Canadians make four liquors in using the japonica:</p>
<p>The FIRST liquor is made by dissolving, for 20 sides of upper, 15 lbs. of <ingredient>terra japonica</ingredient> in sufficient <ingredient>water</ingredient> to cover the upper, being tanned. The SECOND liquor contains the same amount of <ingredient>japonica,</ingredient> and 8 lbs. of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> also.

</formula>
<formula class="household">
<p>3. <purpose>DEER SKINS--TANNING AND BUFFING FOR GLOVES.</purpose>--For each, <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> take a <ingredient>bucket of water,</ingredient> and put into it 1 qt. of <ingredient>lime;</ingredient> let the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> or skins lay in from 3 to 4 days; then rinse in <ingredient>clean water,</ingredient> hair, and grain; then soak them in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to get out the <ingredient>glue;</ingredient> now scour or pound in good <ingredient>soap suds,</ingredient> for half an hour; after which take <ingredient>white vitriol,</ingredient> <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> 1 table-spoon of each to a <ingredient>skin;</ingredient> these will be dissolved in sufficient <ingredient>water</ingredient> to cover the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> and remain in it for 24 hours; wring out as dry as convenient; and spread on with a brush 1/2 pt. of <ingredient>currier's oil,</ingredient> and hang in the sun about 2 days; after which you will scour out the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> with <ingredient>soap suds,</ingredient> and hang out again until perfectly dry; then pull and work them until they are soft; and if a reasonable time does not make them soft, scour out in <ingredient>suds</ingredient> again as before, until complete. The <ingredient>oil</ingredient> may be saved by pouring or taking it from the top of the <ingredient>suds,</ingredient> if left standing a short time. The buff color is given by spreading <ingredient>yellow ochre</ingredient> evenly over the surface of the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> when finished, rubbing it in well with a brush.</p>
<p>The foregoing plan was pursued for a number of years by a brother of mine, and I have worn the gloves and know the value of the recipe; but there are plans of using acid, and if the quantity is not too great, there is no reason in the world why it may not be used; the only caution necessary is to see that the strength of acid does not kill the nature of
 
<pb n="219" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=225"/>
the leather; in proper quantities it <emph rend="italic">tans</emph> only, instead of destroying the fiber. I will give a couple of the most valuable methods.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>4. <purpose>TANNING WITH ACID.</purpose>--After having removed the hair, scouring, soaking, and pounding in the <ingredient>suds,</ingredient> &#38;c., as in the last recipe, in place of the <ingredient>white</ingredient> <ingredient>vitriol,</ingredient> <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as there mentioned, take <ingredient>oil of vitriol,</ingredient> (<ingredient>sulphuric acid</ingredient>) and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> equal parts of each, and thoroughly wet the flesh-side of the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> with it, by means of a sponge or cloth upon a stick; then folding up the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> letting it lie for 20 minutes only, having ready a solution of <ingredient>sal-soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> say 1 lb. to a bucket of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and soak the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> or <ingredient>skins</ingredient> in that for 2 hours, when you will wash in <ingredient>clean water</ingredient> and apply a little dry <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> letting lie in the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over night, or that length of time; then remove the flesh with a <implement>blunt knife,</implement> or, if doing business on a large scale, by means of the regular beam and flesh-knife; when dry, or nearly so, soften by pulling and rubbing with the hands, and also with a piece of pumice-stone. This, of course, is the quickest way of tanning, and by only wetting the <ingredient>skins</ingredient> with the acid, and soaking out in 20 minutes, they are not rotted.</p>
<p><variation>5. ANOTHER METHOD.--<ingredient>Oil of vitriol</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>salt</ingredient> 1 teacup; <ingredient>milk</ingredient> sufficient to handsomely cover the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> not exceeding 3 qts.; warm the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> then add the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and vitriol; stir the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> in the liquid 40 minutes, keeping it warm; then dry and work it as directed in No. 4.</variation></p>
</formula>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>6. <purpose>TANNING SHEEP-SKINS, APPLICABLE FOR MITTENS, DOOR-MATS, ROBES, &#38;C.</purpose>--For mats, take two long-wooled <ingredient>skins,</ingredient> make a strong <ingredient>suds,</ingredient> using <ingredient>hot water;</ingredient> when it is cold wash the <ingredient>skins</ingredient> in it, carefully squeezing them between the hands to get the dirt out of the wool; then wash the <ingredient>soap</ingredient> out with c<ingredient>lean cold water.</ingredient> Now dissolve <ingredient>alum</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> of each half a pound, with a little <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> which put into a tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> sufficient to cover the <ingredient>skins,</ingredient> and let them soak in it over night, or twelve hours, then hang over a pole to drain. When they are well drained, spread or stretch carefully on a board to dry. They need not be tacked if you will draw them out, several times, with the hand, while drying. When yet a little damp, have one ounce, each, of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> pulverized, and sprinkle on the flesh-side of each <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> rubbing in well; then lay the flesh-sides together, and hang in the shade for two or three days, turning the under <ingredient>skin</ingredient> uppermost every day, until perfectly dry. Then scrape the flesh-side with a <implement>blunt knife,</implement> to remove any remaining scraps of flesh, trim off projecting points, and rub
 
<pb n="220" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=226"/>
the flesh-side with pumice or rotten stone, and with the hands; they will be very <ingredient>white</ingredient> and beautiful, suitable for a <ingredient>foot-mat,</ingredient> also nice in a sleigh or wagon of a cold day They also make good robes, in place of the buffalo, if colored, and sewed together. And <ingredient>lamb-skins,</ingredient> (or <ingredient>sheep-skins,</ingredient> if the wool is trimmed off evenly to about one-half or three-fourths of an inch in length) make most beautiful and warm mittens for ladies, or gentlemen.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>7. <purpose>TANNING FUR AND OTHER SKINS--FIFTY DOLLAR RECIPE.</purpose>--FIRST,--Remove the legs and other useless parts, and soak the skin soft; then remove the fleshy substances and soak in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> for an hour; now:</p>
<p>Take for each <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> <ingredient>borax,</ingredient> <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and <ingredient>glauber-salts,</ingredient> of each 1/2 oz., and dissolve or wet with <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> sufficient to allow it to be spread on the flesh-side of the skin.</p>
<p>Put it on with a brush, thickest in the centre or thickest part of the skin, and double the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> together, flesh-side in, keeping it in a <emph rend="italic">cool</emph> place for twenty-four hours, not allowing it to freeze, however.</p>
<p>SECOND,--Wash the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> clean, and then:</p>
<p>Take <ingredient>sal-soda</ingredient> 1 oz.; <ingredient>borax</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; refined <ingredient>soap</ingredient> 2 ozs.; (Colgate's <ingredient>white soap</ingredient> is recommended as the best, but our "<ingredient>White Hard Soap</ingredient>" is the same quality,); melt them slowly together, being careful not to allow them to boil, and apply the mixture to the flesh-side as at first--roll up again and keep in a <emph rend="italic">warm</emph> place for 24 hours.</p>
<p>THIRD.--Wash the skin clean, as above, and have <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> two ounces, dissolved in <ingredient>hot rain water</ingredient> sufficient to well saturate the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> then:</p>
<p>Take <ingredient>alum</ingredient> 4 ozs.; <ingredient>salt</ingredient> 8 ozs.; and dissolve also in <ingredient>hot rain water;</ingredient> when sufficiently cool to allow the handling of it without scalding, put in the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> for 12 hours; then wring out the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and hang up, for 12 hours more, to dry. Repeat this last soaking and drying from 2 to 4 times, according to the desired softness of the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> when finished.</p>
<p>LASTLY,--Finish by pulling, working, &#38;c., and finally by rubbing with a piece of <ingredient>pumice-stone</ingredient> and fine <ingredient>sand-paper.</ingredient></p>
<p>This works admirably on <ingredient>sheep-skins</ingredient> as well as on <ingredient>fur-skins,</ingredient> dog, cat, or <ingredient>wolf-skins</ingredient> also, making a durable leather well adapted to washing.</p>
<p>A man in our county paid fifty dollars for this recipe, and 
 
<pb n="221" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=227"/>
has made his money out of it many times. It is very valuable.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p>8. <purpose>TANNING DEER AND WOODCHUCK-SKINS FOR WHIPS, STRINGS, &#38;C.</purpose>--Prepare the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> according to the last recipe, then:</p>
<p>Take <ingredient>oil of vitriol</ingredient> 1 oz.; <ingredient>salt</ingredient> 1 pt.; <ingredient>milk</ingredient> 3 qts.; mix.</p>
<p>Now dip the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> in <ingredient>warm rain water</ingredient> having sufficient <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> in it to make it rather strong, or as in the THIRD head of last recipe, and work and squeeze it well for a few minutes, then wring dry as convenient and put it into the vitriol mixture for fifty minutes, stirring all the time; now wring out and soak awhile; and finally dry and work until soft.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="household">
<p>9. <purpose>GRAIN-SIDE BLACKING, FOR TEN CENTS A BARREL.</purpose>--Take a barrel and put into it quite a quantity of old iron, cast or wrought, then fill nearly full of <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> and add 1 pt. of <ingredient>oil</ingredient> of <ingredient>vitrol;</ingredient> stir it up well, and in a month or two you have just as good blacking for the grain-side, as could be made by using <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in place of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>This makes good blacking for boot, shoe, or harness edge, also. The acid used is so trifling that no injury will arise to the leather.</p>
<p>Tanners will, of course, first apply the urine before applying the blacking, saving from ten to twenty dollars yearly, in this way, instead of the old plan of using <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient></p>
</formula>
<formula class="household">
<p>10. <purpose>FRENCH FINISH, FOR LEATHER.</purpose>--Take a common wooden pail of scraps, (the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and pates of <ingredient>calf-skins</ingredient> are the best) and put a handful each, of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pulverized alum</ingredient> amongst them and let them stand three days; then boil them until you get a thick <ingredient>paste;</ingredient> in using you will warm it; in the first application, put a little <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> with it, and for the second, a little <ingredient>soft soap,</ingredient> and use it in the regular way of finishing, and your leather will be soft and pliable, like the French <ingredient>calf-skin.</ingredient></p>
<p>I have no doubt that this would make a good preparation for shoemakers to use in treeing-out, leaving a soft pliableness, not otherwise obtained.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="household">
<p>11. <purpose>FRENCH PATENT LEATHER.</purpose>--The process which has been so successfully adopted by the French artisans in glazing leather, so as to give it the repute for superior quality
 
<pb n="222" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=228"/>
and beauty which it now universally sustains, is as follows:</p>
<p>Work into the skin with appropriate tools three or four successive coatings of drying varnish, made by boiling <ingredient>linseed-oil</ingredient> with <ingredient>white-lead</ingredient> and <ingredient>litharge,</ingredient> in the proportion of one pound of each of the latter to a gallon of the former, and adding a portion of <ingredient>chalk</ingredient> or <ingredient>ochre</ingredient>--each coating being thoroughly dried before the application of the next. <ingredient>Ivory black</ingredient> is then substituted for the <ingredient>chalk</ingredient> or ochre, the varnish thinned with <ingredient>spirits of turpentine,</ingredient> and five additional applications made in the same manner as before, except that it is put on thin and not worked in. The leather is rubbed down with pumice-stone, in powder, and then placed in a room at 90 degs., out of the way of dust. The last varnish is prepared by boiling 1/2 lb. of <ingredient>asphaltum</ingredient>with 10 lbs. of the drying <ingredient>oil</ingredient> used in the first step of the process, and then stirring in 5 lbs. of <ingredient>copal varnish</ingredient> and 10 lbs. of <ingredient>turpentine.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose>OIL--PAINT--TO REDUCE WITH WATER.</purpose>--Take <ingredient>gum shellac</ingredient> 1 lb.; sal-<ingredient>soda</ingredient> 1/2 lb.; <ingredient>water</ingredient> 3 pts.; put all into a suitable kettle and boil, stirring till all is dissolved. If it does not all dissolve, add a little more <ingredient>sal-soda;</ingredient> this, when cool, can be bottled for use. If it smells bad when opened it does not hurt it.</p>
<p>DIRECTIONS FOR USING.--Mix up two quarts of <ingredient>oil</ingredient> paint as usual, except no turpentine is to be used--any color desired. Now put one pint of the gum shellac mixture with the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> paint when it becomes thick, and may be reduced with <ingredient>water</ingredient> to a proper consistence to lay on with a brush. Two coats will be required, and with the second coat sand may be applied if desired. I used this upon a picket-fence with <ingredient>white-lead</ingredient> and <ingredient>yellow ochre</ingredient> for the body and a little <ingredient>lamp-black</ingredient> to give it a dark shade, putting on sand with the second coat. It is still firm and good, the work being done nearly four years ago.</p>
<p>The sand was applied with a tub-like box, with many small holes to allow the even spreading of the sand, as with a <implement>pepper-box.</implement> I do not regret using this kind of paint, nor the sanding, as it adds much to the durability of any outdoor painting. But a better plan of sanding is represented in the "Painter's Sanding Apparatus" below.</p>

<p>Some persons may think it bad policy to learn painters <purpose>to reduce oil-paint with water,</purpose>but I think every man should be told of the plan, who is going to have a job of work done, and if he makes up his mind to try any thing of the kind, it is then his own business; and I am perfectly sincere in recommending it, for if there was any great fault in it, four years would show it.</p>

<p>Many persons like the plan of sanding generally, after painting; but from the fact that when it is desired to renew the paint, brushes cannot last long upon the sand, I think it only proper to sand fences or fronts, where boys' <emph rend="italic">knives</emph> would be too freely used.</p>

<p><purpose>DOOR PLATES--TO MAKE.</purpose>--Cut your glass the right size, and make it perfectly clean with <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> or <ingredient>soap;</ingredient> then cut a strip of tin-foil sufficiently long and wide for the name, and with a piece of ivory or other burnisher rub it lengthwise to make it smooth; now wet the glass with the <ingredient>tongue,</ingredient> (as saliva is the best sticking substance,) or if the glass is very large, use a weak solution of <ingredient>gum arabic,</ingredient> or the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> in half a pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and lay on the foil, rubbing it down to the glass with a bit of cloth, then also with the burnisher; the more it is burnished the better will it look; now mark the width on the foil which is to be the hight of the letter and put on a straight-edge and hold it firmly to the foil, and with a sharp knife cut the foil and take off the superfluous edges; then either lay out the letters on the back of the foil, (so they shall read correctly on the front) by your own judgment or by means of pattern-letters, which can be purchased for that purpose; cut with the knife, carefully holding down the pattern or straight-edge, whichever you use; then rub down the edge of all the letters with the back of the knife, or edge of the burnisher, which prevents the black paint or japan which you next put over the back of the plate, from getting
 
<pb n="228" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=234"/>
under the foil; having put a line above and one below the name, or a border around the whole plate or not, as you bargain for the job. The japan is made by dissolving asphaltum in just enough turpentine to cut it (see "Asphaltum Varnish"); apply with a brush as other paint over the back of the letters and over the glass, forming a background. This is used on the iron frame of the plate also, putting it on when the plate is a little hot, and as soon as it cools it is dry. A little <ingredient>lamp-black</ingredient> may be rubbed into it if you desire it any blacker than it is without it.</p>
<p>If you choose, you can remove every other foil letter, after the japan is dry, and paint in its place, red, blue, or other colored letters, to make a greater variety out of which for your customers to choose, as the one they desire you to follow in getting up their plate. Tin foil being thicker than silver or gold foil, will not show the paint through it in little spots as they do; but if these foils are desired to be used, you can put on two thicknesses by proceeding as follows, which prevents the paint from showing through them: Lay on the first coat of these foils the same as directed for the tin-foil, and smooth it down by rubbing on the front of the glass; then breathe on it until a dampness is caused; now put on the second and burnish well, having paper over it; but instead of the knife to cut around your pattern or straight-edge, take a sharp needle, using the point, make lines through the leaf around the pattern letter or straigt-edge; then with a bit of Jewelers' wood, or other hard wood, made to a narrow and sharp point, remove all up to the lines, both in and around the letters, as these foils have not the substance to peel off as the tin-foil, japanning over them the same as the other letters. Paper letters can be cut out of advertisements and put on by wetting the glass the same as for the foil, jappanning over them, and when dry, removing them and painting the places out of which they came with various colors as desired, as the japan will not peel, but makes a sharp and distinct edge; and these painted letters look well, in this way; and by taking advantage of printed letters, saves the skill and time necessary to form them.</p>
<p>To illustrate; in the name given below, A may be gold-foil; W will be blue; C, red; H, black; A, gold-foil; S, blue; E, red; M, black; and again D, gold-foil, which any one can see makes a more showy plate than if all were of one foil, or one color.</p>

<p>Set your glass in the frame with putty, and put a thin coat of putty over the whole plate, as the plaster of Parish filling which is generally used soon eats out the japan or paint, and spoils the job. Persons with any ingenuity can very soon make a nice plate if they will pay attention to the above rules, as well as to pay five dollars for instructions, as a little practice must be had to become perfect, even if you do pay five dollars for an hour or two's telling and showing.

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>ETCHING AND GRINDING UPON GLASS--FOR SIGNS, OR SIDE LIGHTS.</purpose>--Take the "Asphaltum Varnish," and with a small pencil lay out the name or design, not putting the varnish upon the letters, but around it, leaving the space which the letters of the sign are to occupy, free and clear, as seen in the following door plate, represented in the wood cut, and by the way, a very nice style of letter for that purpose also, we think:</p>
<illustration><description>A rectangular sign engraved with the words "A. W. CHASE, M. D." in large white letters on a dark background.</description></illustration>
<p>The varnish is to cover the black surface in the sign or name. The white line around the outside represents a border which improves the appearance of the plate; when the varnish is dry have some melted bees-wax and as it begins to cool, with a knife take some of it up and scrape it off upon the edge of the glass, being etched, so as to form a wall to hold the acid upon the glass while etching; now lay the glass flat and pour a little <ingredient>flouric acid</ingredient> on to the name, letter, or design thus prepared, and let it remain on for one hour, not allowing the glass to be touched or moved for that time; then pour off the acid into your bottle, and it can be used again. The asphalt prevents the acid from eating or etching only the letter, and the wax wall prevents the acid from flowing off and being wasted. When you pour off the acid wash the glass with a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> scrape off the wax and remove the asphalt with a little <ingredient>turpentine,</ingredient> and all is done.</p>
<p>The above directions are for plain glass; but if you desire, you can gild the letter which is etched (eat out,) or you can gild all except the letter, if desired, as described in the recipe for "Door Plates," or you can grind the surface of the glass
 
<pb n="230" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=236"/>
as described under the head of "Glass-grinding for Signs, Shades," &#38;c. This applies equally well to "flashed," or what is called "stained glass," worked in the same way as above, putting the design or letters upon the stained side, which eats away the color and leaves the design clean and white; or you can etch only a part of the way through the stain, which shows up the letter or flower lighter in color than the rest of the glass, which makes it look very beautiful for side-lights in halls, lamps, druggists' windows, &#38;c.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of colored glass--one is called "Pot-metal," the other "Flashed." The pot-metal glass is made by mixing the stain or coloring with the melted glass, while making, and consequently is alike all the way through.--The stained glass is made by applying the color to one side of the glass after it is made, then applying sufficient heat to allow it to take hold of the glass only--the color is all on one side; this is the kind desired.</p>
<p><variation>If it is desired <purpose>to etch upon druggists' or other jars,</purpose> it can be done by preparing the name to be put on, with the <ingredient>varnish</ingredient> and <ingredient>wax;</ingredient> then have a <ingredient>lead</ingredient> box without top or bottom; in shape on the lower edge to fit the shape of the jar, and press this down upon the wax to make it tight; then pour your acid into the box which keeps it in its place the same as the wax does on a flat surface. Ornaments or <ingredient>flourishes</ingredient> can be put on as well as letters.</variation></p>
<p>The old plan was to cover the whole surface with wax, then remove it from the letter, which was very slow and troublesome, and if a bit of wax remained upon the bottle, the acid could not cut where the wax remained, then to hold the glass over the fumes of the acid, instead of putting the acid upon the glass.</p>

<p>Taking a piece of flat brass sufficiently large not to dip into the letters, but pass over them when gliding upon the surface of the glass; then with <ingredient>flour of emery,</ingredient> and keeping it wet, you can grind the whole surface, very quickly, to look like the ground glass globes, of ten seen upon lamps, except the letter which is eaten below the general surface.</p>

<p>Druggists through the country do not keep this acid generally, but they can get it in the principal cities and furnish it for about seventy-five cents per ounce, and that ounce will do at least fifty dollars worth of work. It is put up in gutta percha-bottles, or lead-bottles, and must be kept in them when not in use, having corks of the same material.

<p><purpose>PORCELAIN FINISH--VERY HARD AND WHITE, FOR PARLORS.</purpose>--To prepare the wood for the finish, if it be pine, give one or two coats of the "Varnish--Transparent for Wood," which prevents the pitch from oozing out causing the finish to turn yellow; next, give the room, at least, four coats of pure zinc, which may be ground in only sufficient <ingredient>oil</ingredient> to enable it to grind properly, then mix to a proper consistence with <ingredient>turpentine</ingredient> or <ingredient>naptha.</ingredient> Give each coat time to dry.

<p>Mr. Miles, of this city, one of our scientific painters, has been sufficiently kind to furnish me this recipe prepared expressly for this work, therefore, the most implicit confidence may be placed in it, yet any one can judge for themselves, from the nature of the articles used, that it must be white and hard. He goes on to say that if the <ingredient>French-zinc</ingredient> in <ingredient>varnish</ingredient> cannot be procured, the varnish may be whitened with zinc ground in <ingredient>oil</ingredient> as a very good substitute, being careful not to use too much, in which case it will diminish the gloss, and be more liable to turn yellow. A little turpentine or naptha may be added, if too thick to work well, but in no instance should <ingredient>oil</ingredient> be used to thin the paint.</p>
<p>This finish, if properly applied, is very beautiful, and although purely white, may be kept clean more easily than other kinds of painting by simply using a dusting brush; or

<p><purpose>FILES AND RASPS--TO RE-CUT BY A CHEMICAL PROCESS.</purpose>--Dissolve <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> 4 ozs., to <ingredient>water</ingredient> 1 qt., sufficient to cover the files, and boil them in it for half an hour; then take out, wash and dry them; now stand them in a jar, filling it up with rainwater and <ingredient>sulphuric acid,</ingredient> in the proportion of <ingredient>water</ingredient> 1 qt., to acid 4 ozs.</p>
<p>If the files are coarse, they will need to remain in about twelve hours; but for fine files, six to eight hours will be all-sufficient. When you take them out, wash them clean, dry quickly, and put a little <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> upon them, to prevent rust.</p>
<p>This plan is applicable to blacksmiths, gun-smiths, tinners, copper-smiths, machinists, &#38;c., &#38;c. Copper and tin

workers will only require a short time to take the articles out of their files, as the soft metals with which they become filled, are soon dissolved, leaving the files about as good as new. For blacksmiths and <implement>saw-mill</implement> men, it will require the full time.</p>
<p>They may be re-cut two or three times, making in all more service than it took to wear out the file at first.</p>
<p>The preparation can be kept and used as long as you see action take place upon putting the files into it. Keep it covered when not in use.</p>
<p>If persons, when filing, would lift up the file, in carrying back, there would be no necessity of a re-cutting, but in <emph rend="italic">drawing</emph> it back they soon turn a wire-edge, which the acid removes. It also thins the tooth. Many persons have doubted this fact; but I know that the common three-square file, (used for sharpening saws,) when worn out and thrown by, for a year or two, may be again used with nearly the same advantage as a new one. The philosophy of it is this--the action of the atmosphere acts upon the same principle of the acid, corrodes (eats off) the surface, giving a-new, a square, cutting edge. Try it, all ye doubtful; I have tried both, and know their value. Boiling in the <ingredient>saleratus-water</ingredient> removes <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> and allows the acid to act upon the steel.</p>

<p>Then they were bent to suit the shape of the body, and to press upon the body only sufficient, after the pads sole-leather, covered with cotton or linen cloth, having stuffed in a little batting to make it rest as easy as possible.

The back pad is secured by one screw only. The spring is oiled, then covered with <ingredient>sheep skin,</ingredient> to prevent rusting.

buckle, or with a piece of cloth sewed into a string of suitable width to sit easy where it bears upon the hip, in passing to tie upon the other end of the spring, just back of the front pad. The bend which is given the spring, before it is bent to the shape of the body, gives it room to rise when the leg is raised, without lifting the pad from its position, saving the necessity of another strap to pass around <emph rend="italic">under</emph> the thigh, as with the patent truss, which is very annoying to the wearer.

<p>DIRECTIONS.--Plug both ends of the barrel, and let the plugs stick out three or four inches, to handle by, and also to prevent the fluid from entering the barrel, causing it to rust; polish the barrel perfectly; then rub it well with <ingredient>quick-lime</ingredient> by means of a cloth, which removes <ingredient>oil</ingredient> or <ingredient>grease;</ingredient> now apply the browning fluid with a clean white cloth, apply one coat and set in a warm, dark place, until a red rust is formed over the whole surface, which will require, in warm weather, from ten to twelve hours, and in cold weather, from fifteen to twenty hours, or until the rust becomes red; then card it down with a gun-maker's cared and rub off with a clean cloth; repeat the process until the color suits, as each coat gives a darker shade.</p>

<p>2. <purpose><alt synonym1="browning process for gun barrels">QUICKER AND LESS LABORIOUS PROCESS.</alt></purpose>--While in Evansville, Ind., I sold one of my books to C.

<p><ingredient>Soft water</ingredient> 1 qt., and dissolve in it <ingredient>blue vitriol</ingredient> 2 ozs.; <ingredient>corrosive
 
<pb n="247" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=253"/>

<p>But Mr. Sutherland, the gunsmith of this city, says the brown from this recipe will soon rub off; none being permanent unless carded down properly, as directed with the first recipe, that mixture being also superior.</p>

<p>The article to be plated is to be suspended upon the strip of zinc, as represented upon the long end of the rod, which is to be placed as before spoken of, in a jar containing the gold solution, instead of having it upon the stick spoken of when plating without the battery.

Let the horse be so tied that he cannot get his mouth to the place for 3 or 4 hours, otherwise he will blister his mouth and blemish the part. Then let him run until the scab comes off of itself without scraping, which injures the roots of the hair. Then repeat as before, and follow up for 3 or 4 times blistering, and all bone enlargements will be re-absorbed, if not of more than a year or two's standing.</p>
<p>It is also good for callous sinews, and strains of long standing, spavins, big-head, &#38;c., but if there are ring-bones or spavins of so long standing that this does not cause their cure, you will proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Now clip the hair and prick the bone or callous part as full of holes as you can with a <implement>pegging-awl,</implement> which is just long enough to break through the callous part only.

<p>10. <purpose>BONE-SPAVINS--NORWEGIAN CURE.</purpose>--<attribution>S. B. Marshall, the Champion Horse-Shoer, and Farrier, of White Pigeon, Mich.,</attribution> obtained this plan of an old Norwegian Farrier, and also his plan of curing poll-evil, which see, and assures me that he has been very successful with them.

<pb n="255" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=261"/>
<p>He says it does not remove the hair, but that it cures the largest and worst cases. He gives a test for good <ingredient>oil of origanum,</ingredient> saying that much of it is reduced with turpentine; and if so reduced, that it will spread on the skin, like turpentine; but if good, that it does not spread on the skin, but stands, like other <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> where a drop is put on. I am not certain about the genuineness of this test; yet I find quite a difference in the spreading of the oils; for that which is known to contain turpentine spreads fast and freely; whilst that which is believed to be pure, spreads very slowly, yet does finally spread. The pure is of a dark wine color, whilst the poor is of a lighter shade, and somewhat cloudy.</p>

<p>TAMING--PRINCIPLES APPLIED TO WILD AND VICIOUS HORSES.--I have thought, in closing up this Department, that I could not devote a page to a better purpose than to the so-called <emph rend="italic">secret</emph> of taming. For it <emph rend="italic">is</emph> a secret, but it lies in a different point from what is <emph rend="italic">generally</emph> believed, which I will attempt to show.</p>
<p>Several persons are advertising books for taming wild horses, and other persons are going about teaching the art to classes in private. Probably the pupils get their money's worth. But, why do so many fail? <emph rend="italic">The whole secret lies in this, that many persons can never handle a horse, with all the instruction in the world--it is not in them.</emph> They cannot establish a sympathy between themselves and the horse, and if they become horse <emph rend="italic">trainers,</emph> they have only mistaken their calling, and the money they laid out is perhaps as cheap a way as they could be taught their mistake.</p>
<p>To be a <emph rend="italic">successful</emph> horse trainer, he must have a <emph rend="italic">sympathy</emph> with the horse, and a <emph rend="italic">personal</emph> power of control. This reminds us of an old gentleman's remarks on the subject of sweeny. He said: "There were a great many recipes of penetrating oils, applications, etc., but the great secret was in <emph rend="italic">faith,"</emph> without which no person will persevere a sufficient length of time with either of them. This holds good in all diseases, as well as in handling or taming a horse.</p>
<p>The mystery or secret, then, is in <emph rend="italic">knowing</emph> how, and having the <emph rend="italic">stamina</emph> (power) to do it.</p>
<p>As for recipes, they consist in using the <implement>horse-castor</implement> or wart, which grows upon the inside of the leg, grated fine, oil of cumin, and oil of rhodium, kept separate in air-tight bottles; these all possess peculiar properties for attracting and subduing animals.</p>
<p>"Rub a little oil of cumin upon your hand, and approach the horse in the field, on the windward side, so that he can smell the cumin. The horse will let you come up to him without trouble.</p>
 
<pb n="268" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=274"/>
<p>"Immediately rub your hand gently on the horse's nose, getting a little of the oil on it. You can then lead him any where. Give him a little of the <implement>castor</implement> on a piece of loaf-sugar, apple, or potato.</p>
<p>"Put eight drops of the oil of rhodium into a lady's thimble. Take the thimble between the thumb and middle finger of your right hand, with the fore-finger stopping the mouth of the thimble to prevent the oil from running out whilst you are opening the mouth of the horse.</p>
<p>"As soon as you have opened the horse's mouth, tip the thimble over upon his tongue, and he is your servant. He will follow you like a pet dog. Very doubtful.--AUTHOR.</p>
<p>"Ride fearless and promptly, with your knee pressed to the side of the horse, and your toes turned in and heels out; then you will always be on the alert for a shy or sheer from the horse, and he can never throw you.</p>
<p>"If you want to teach him to lie down, stand on his nigh or left side; have a couple of leather straps, about six feet long; string up his left leg with one of them around his neck; strap the other end of it over his shoulders; hold it in your hand, and when you are ready, tell him to lie down, at the same time gently, firmly, and steadily pulling on the strap, touching him lightly with a switch. The horse will immediately lie down. Do this a few times, and you can make him lie down without the straps.</p>
<p>"He is now your pupil and friend. You can teach him anything, only be kind to him--be gentle. Love him and he will love you. Feed him before you do yourself. Shelter him well, groom him yourself, keep him clean, and at night always give him a good bed."</p>
<p>It will be perceived, by reference to the following item from <attribution rend="italic">Bell's Life,</attribution> that the secret for taming horses, by which Mr. Rarey has made himself so rich and famous, instead of being a divination of his own, was probably obtained by him through some accidental contact with an old volume, which had long disappeared from observation, and hardly held a place in public libraries:</p>
<p>A correspondent sends us the following: "In the Gentleman's Farriery, by Bartlett, (sixth edition) published in 1762, (one hundred years ago,) page 293, is the following: 'The method proposed by Dr. Bracken is to tie up one of
 
<pb n="269" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=275"/>
the fore feet close, and to fasten a cord or small rope about the other fetlock, bringing the end of it over the horse's shoulders; then let him be hit or kicked with your foot behind that knee, at the same time pulling his nose down strongly to the manger. You will bring him upon his knees, where he should be held till he is tired, which cannot be long, but if he does not lie down soon, let him be thrust sideways against his quarters, to throw him over; by forcing him down several times in this way, you may teach him to lie down, at the same words you first used for that purpose." You will see that Mr. Rarey's system is exactly the same.</p>
<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that he <emph rend="italic">obtained</emph> the knowledge, and naturally possessing the firmness, <emph rend="italic">fearless energy,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">muscle</emph> sufficient to back the whole, he has become <emph rend="italic">the horse tamer of the world.</emph></p>
<p>Without all these qualifications no one need undertake the business, no matter how often he pays five dollars for recipes or instructions.</p>

<p><purpose>FURNITURE--FINISHING WITH ONLY ONE COAT OF VARNISH, NOT USING GLUE, PASTE, OR SHELLAC.</purpose>--Take boiled <ingredient>linseed-oil</ingredient> and give the furniture a coat with a brush; then immediately sprinkle dry <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> upon it and rub it in well with your hand, or a brush which is worn rather short and stiff, over all the surface--the <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> absorbs the <ingredient>oil;</ingredient> and the pores of the wood are thus filled with a perfect coat of <ingredient>putty,</ingredient> which will last for ages; and <ingredient>water</ingredient> will not spot it nor have any effect upon it.</p>
<p>For mouldings and deep creases in turned work, you can mix them quite thick, and apply them together, with the old brush, but on smooth surfaces, the hand and dry <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> are best. If <ingredient>black walnut</ingredient> is the wood to be finished, you will put a trifle of burned umber in the <ingredient>whiting,</ingredient>--if for <ingredient>cherry,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>Venetian-red;</ingredient> beech or maple will require

less red. Only sufficient is to be used, in either case, to make the <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> the color of the wood, being finished. Bedstead-posts, banisters, or standards for bedsteads and all other turned articles can have the finish put on in the <implement>lathe,</implement> in double quick time; spreading a newspaper on the <implement>lathe</implement> to save the scattering <ingredient>whiting,</ingredient> applying it with the hand or hands, having an old cloth to rub off the loose <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> which does not enter the pores of the wood,--the same with smooth surfaces also.</p>
<p>This preparation is cheap; and it is a wonder that furniture men have not thought of it before. Three coats of varnish without it is not as level as one with it. From the fact that some of the varnish enters the pores of the wood and does not dry smooth; but with the pores filled with this preparation, of course, it must dry smooth and level, without rubbing down.</p>

<p>It is better if heat in, but does quite well without heating. Finish up in every other way as usual.</p>
<p>This finish is applicable to fancy tables, stands, lounges, coffins, &#38;c., and equally beautiful on knots and crotches, giving <ingredient>walnut</ingredient> the actual appearance of mahogany, and as it is <emph rend="italic">appearances</emph> only that most people depend upon, why will not this do as well as to transport timber from beyond the seas.</p>

<p>This, for chairs, looks very beautiful to apply the darkening mixture by means of a flat, thin-haired, brush, leaving only a little of the red color in sight; and if you want to make the cringles, as sometimes seen in rose-wood, it is done with a single tooth or pen, bearing on sometimes hard and then light, &#38;c, &#38;c.

<p><ingredient>Spirits of turpentine</ingredient> 1 gal.; <ingredient>pulverized gum asphaltum</ingredient> 2 lbs. Put them into an iron kettle and place upon a stove, which prevents the possibility of fire getting at the turpentine; dissolve by heat, frequently stirring until dissolved. Put into a jug or can while hot.</p>
<p>When desired to use any of it, pour out and reduce with turpentine to the right shade for the work being stained. With a little practice you can make any shade desired. If used with a brush over a red stain, as mentioned in the rose-wood stain recipes, especially for chairs and bedsteads, it very nearly resembles that wood. Mixing a little varnish with the turpentine when reducing it, prevents it from spotting, and causes it to dry quicker. By rubbing a little <ingredient>lamp-black</ingredient> with it you can make it a perfect black, if desired.</p>

<p>This varnish is valuable for plows, or any other article where you wish to show the grain of the wood, and for pine. when you wish to finish up rooms with white, as the "Porcelain Finish;" a coat or two of it effectually prevents the pitch from oozing out, which would stain the finish.</p>

<p><purpose>HAIR DYE</purpose>--IN TWO NUMBERS.--No. 1. Take <ingredient>gallic acid</ingredient> 1/3 oz.; <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> 8 ozs.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 16 ozs.; put the acid in the <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> then add the <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p><variation>No. 2. Take for No. 2, crystalized nitrate of silver 1 oz.; <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> strongest kind, 3 ozs.; <ingredient>gum arabic</ingredient> 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 6 ozs. Observe, in making it, that the silver is to be put into the <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> and not corked until it is dissolved; the gum is to be dissolved in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then all mixed, and it is ready for use.</variation></p>
<p>Barbers will probably make this amount at a time, as it comes much cheaper than in small quantities; but if families or others, for individual use, only wish a little, take drachms, instead of ounces, which you see will make only one-eighth of the amount.</p>
<p>DIRECTIONS FOR APPLYING.--First, wash the whiskers or hair with the <ingredient>"shampoo," </ingredient>and rinse out well, rubbing with a towel until nearly dry; then with a brush apply No. 1, wetting completely, and use the dry towel again to remove all superfluous <ingredient>water;</ingredient> then with another brush, (tooth-brushes are best,) wet every part with No. 2, and it becomes instantaneously black; as soon as it becomes dry, wash off with <ingredient>hard water,</ingredient> then with <ingredient>soap</ingredient> and <ingredient>water;</ingredient> apply a little <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and all is complete.</p>
<p>The advantages of this dye are, that if you get any stain upon the skin, wipe it off with a cloth at the time, and the washing removes all appearances of stain; and the whiskers or hair never turn red, do not crock, and are a beautiful black.</p>
<p>However, cyanuret of <ingredient>potassium</ingredient> 1 dr., to 1 oz. of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> will take off any stain upon the skin, arising from <ingredient>nitrate of silver;</ingredient> but it is poison, and should not touch sore places nor be left where children may get at it.</p>
 
<pb n="275" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=281"/>
<p>Persons whose hair is prematurely gray, will find dye less trouble in using, than the restoratives; for when once applied, nothing more needs being done for several weeks; whilst the restoratives are only slow dyes, and yet need several applications. But that all may have the chance of choosing for themselves, I give you some of the best restoratives in use.</p>

These articles to stand mixed for 14 hours; then add <ingredient>bay rum</ingredient> 1 gill; <ingredient>fine table salt</ingredient> 1 table-spoon; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 3 pts.; <ingredient>essence of bergamot</ingredient> 1 oz.</p>
<p>This preparation not only gives a beautiful gloss, but will cause hair to grow upon bald heads arising from all common causes; and turn gray hair to a dark color.</p>
<p>MANNER OF APPLICATION.--When the hair is thin or bald, make two applications daily, until this amount is used up, unless the hair has come out sufficiently to satisfy you before that time; work it to the roots of the hair with a soft brush or the ends of the fingers, rubbing well each time. For gray hair one application daily is sufficient. It is harmless and will do all that is claimed for it, does not cost only a trifle in comparison to the advertised restoratives of the day; and will be found as good or better than most of them.</p>

<p>If it is only desired <purpose><alt synonym1="hair invigorator" synonym2="hair restorative">to change gray hair to a dark color</alt></purpose>the last will do it; but where the hair is falling out or has already fallen, the first is required to stimulate the scalp to healthy action.</p>

<p>There is not a liniment mentioned in this book, but which, if well rubbed upon the scalp daily for two or three months, will bring out a good head of hair; when the scalp has become glossy and shining, however, and no fine hair growing, you may know that the hair follicle or root, is dead; and nothing can give a head of hair in such cases, any more than grain can grow from ground which has had none scattered upon it. This condition may be known by the shining or glistening appearance of the scalp.</p>

<p>REMARKS.--It may not be considered out of place to make a few remarks here, on the art, as also on the principles, of cookery. For nearly all will acknowledge cooking not only to be an art, but a science, as well. To know how to cook economically is an art. Making money is an art. Now is there not more money made and lost in the kitchen than almost any where else? Does not many a hard-working man have his substance wasted in the kitchen? Does
 
<pb n="281" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=287"/>
not many a shiftless man have his substance saved in the kitchen? A careless cook can waste as much as a man can earn, which might as well be saved. It is not what we earn, as much as what we save, that makes us well-off. A long and happy life is the reward of obedience to nature's laws; and to be independent of want, is not to want what we do not need. Prodigality and idleness constitute a crime against humanity. But frugality and industry, combined with moral virtue and intelligence, will insure individual happiness and national prosperity. Economy is an institute of nature and enforced by Bible precept: "Gather up the fragments, that nothing be lost." Saving is a more difficult art than earning; some people put dimes into pies and puddings, where others only put in cents; the cent dishes are the most healthy.</p>
<p>Almost any woman can cook well, if she have <emph rend="italic">plenty</emph> with which to do it; but the real <emph rend="italic">science</emph> of cooking is to be able to cook a good meal, or dish, with but <emph rend="italic">little</emph> out of which to make it. This is what our few recipes shall assist you in doing.</p>
<p>As to the principles of cooking, remember that water cannot be made more than boiling hot--no matter how much you hasten the fire, you cannot hasten the cooking, of meat, potatoes, &#38;c., one moment; a brisk boil is sufficient. When meat is to be boiled for eating, put it into boiling water at the beginning, by which its juices are preserved. But if you wish to extract these juices for soup or broth, put the meat, in small pieces, into cold water, and let it simmer slowly.</p>
<p>The same principle holds good in baking, also. Make the oven the right heat, and give it <emph rend="italic">time</emph> to bake through, is the true plan; if you attempt to hurry it, you only <emph rend="italic">burn,</emph> instead of cooking it <emph rend="italic">done.</emph></p>
<p align="indent1" size="smaller">If you attempt the boiling to hurry, the wood only is wasted;<lb/>But in attempting the baking to hurry, the food, as well, isn't fit to be tasted.</p>

<p>CAKES--<purpose>FEDERAL CAKE.</purpose>--<ingredient>Flour</ingredient> 2 1/2 lbs.; pulverized <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> 1 1/4 lbs.; <ingredient>fresh butter</ingredient> 10 ozs.; 5 <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> well beaten; <ingredient>carbonate of ammonia</ingredient> 1/8 oz.; <ingredient>water</ingredient> 1/2 pt., or <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is best, if you have it.</p>
<p>Grind down the <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> and rub it with the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Rub the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> now make a bowl of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> (unless you choose to work it up in a dish,) and put

in the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> &#38;c., and mix well, and roll out to about a quarter of an inch in thickness; then cut out with a <implement>round cutter,</implement> and place on tins so they touch each other and instead of rising up thicker, in baking, they fill up the space between, and make a square-looking cake, all attached together. While they are yet warm, drench over with <ingredient>white coarsely-pulverized sugar.</ingredient> If they are to be kept in a show-case, by bakers, you can have a board as large as the tin on which you bake them, and lay a dozen or more tinsful on top of each other, as you sprinkle on the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> I cannot see why they are called "Federal," for really, they are good enough for any "Whig."</p>
</recipe>
<p><ingredient>Ammonia</ingredient> should be kept in a wide-mouthed bottle, tightly corked, as it is a very volatile salt. It is known by various names, as "volatile salts," "sal volatile," "hartshorn," "hartshorn-shavings," &#38;c., &#38;c. It is used for smelling-bottles, fainting, as also in baking.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>2. <purpose>ROUGH-AND-READY CAKE.</purpose>--<ingredient>Butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 1 qt.; <ingredient>soda</ingredient> 1 oz.; <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water</ingredient> 1/2 pt.; ground <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> 1 table-spoon; and a little <ingredient>oil of lemon;</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> sufficient.</p>
<p>Mix up the <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> in <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and rub the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard</ingredient> in also; dissolve the <ingredient>soda</ingredient> in the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water;</ingredient> put in the <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and use the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in which the <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is rubbed up, and sufficient more to make the dough of a proper consistence to roll out; cut the cakes out with a long and narrow cutter, and wet the top with a little <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> to remove the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> from the cake; turn the top down, into pulverized <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> and place in an oven sufficiently hot for <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> but keep them in only to bake, not to dry up.

As soon as the {illegible}

<p>Mash the <ingredient>saleratus,</ingredient> then mix all these ingredients together in a suitable pan, and stir in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as long as you can with a spoon; then take the hand and work in more, just so you can roll them by using <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dusting pretty freely; roll out thin, cut and lay upon your buttered or <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed tins; then mix one spoon of <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and two of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and with a small brush or bit of cloth wet over the top of the cakes; this removes the dry <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> causes the cakes to take a nice brown and keep them moist; put into a quick oven, and ten minutes will bake them if the oven is sufficiently hot.

<p>35. <purpose>BRIDE CAKE.</purpose>--Presuming that this work may fall into the hands of some persons who may occasionally have a wedding amongst them, it would be imperfect without a "wedding cake," and as I have lately had an opportunity to test this one, upon "such an occasion," in my own family, I can bear testimony, so can the "printer," to its adaptation for all similar displays.</p>
 
<pb n="288" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=294"/>
<p>Take <ingredient>butter</ingredient> 1 1/2 lbs.; <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> 1 3/4 lbs., half of which is to be Orleans <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> well beaten, 2 lbs.; <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> 4 lbs.; having the seeds taken out, and chopped; <ingredient>English currants</ingredient> having the grit picked out and nicely washed 5 lbs.; <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> cut fine, 2 lbs.; sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient> 2 lbs.; <ingredient>nutmegs</ingredient> 2 in number, and <ingredient>mace</ingredient> as much in bulk; <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> 1 gill to 1/2 pt., in which a dozen or fifteen drops of <ingredient>oil of lemon</ingredient> have been put.</p>
<p>When ready to make your cake, weigh your <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and cut it in pieces, and put it where it will soften, but not melt. Next, stir the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and then add the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and work till <ingredient>white.</ingredient> Next beat the <ingredient>yolks of the eggs,</ingredient> and put them to the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Meanwhile another person should beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> to a stiff froth and put them in. Then add the <ingredient>spices</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and, last of all, the <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> except the <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> which is to be put in about three layers, the bottom layer about one inch from the bottom, and the top one, an inch from the top, and the other in the middle, smoothing the top of the cake by dipping a spoon or two of <ingredient>water</ingredient> upon it for that purpose.</p>
<p>The pan in which it is baked should be about thirteen inches across the top, and five and a half or six inches deep, without scollops, and two three-quart pans also, which it will fill; and they will require to be slowly baked about three to four hours. But it is impossible to give definite rules as to the time required in baking cake. Try whether the cake is done, by piercing it with a broom splinter, and if nothing adheres, it is done.</p>
<p><ingredient>Butter</ingredient> the cake pans well; or if the pans are lined with buttered <ingredient>white paper,</ingredient> the cake will be less liable to burn. Moving cakes while baking tends to make them heavy.</p>
<p>The price of a large "Bride Cake," like this, would be about twelve dollars, and the cost of making it would be about three dollars only, with your two small ones, which would cost as much to buy them as it does to make the whole three.</p>
<p>The foregoing was written and printed over a year ago. The daughter came home, and took dinner with us, one year from the marriage; and her mother set on some of the cake as nice and moist as when baked.</p>

<p>2. <purpose>GRAHAM BREAD.</purpose>--I find in Zion's Herald, of Boston, edited by Rev. E.O. Haven, formerly a Professor in the University at this city, a few remarks upon the "Different Kinds of Bread," including Graham, which so fully explain the <emph rend="italic">philosophy,</emph> and true principles of breadmaking, that I give them an insertion, for the benefit of bread-makers. It says:</p>
<p>"<ingredient>Rice flour</ingredient> added to <ingredient>wheat flour,</ingredient> enables it to take up an increased quantity of <ingredient>water.</ingredient>" [See the "New French Method of Making <ingredient>Bread.</ingredient>"] "Boiled and mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> mixed with the dough, cause the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to retain moisture, and prevent it from drying and crumbling. <ingredient>Rye</ingredient> makes a dark-colored <ingredient>bread;</ingredient> but it is capable of being fermented and raised in the same manner as <ingredient>wheat.</ingredient> It retains its freshness and moisture longer than <ingredient>wheat.</ingredient> An admixture of <ingredient>rye flour</ingredient> with that of <ingredient>wheat,</ingredient> decidedly improves the latter in this respect. <ingredient>Indian corn bread</ingredient> is much used in this country. Mixed with <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> and <ingredient>rye,</ingredient> a dough is produced capable of fermentation, but pure maize meal cannot be fermented so as to form a light <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Its gluten lacks the tenacious quality necessary to produce the regular cell-structure. It is most commonly used in the form of cakes, made to a certain degree light by <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> or <ingredient>sour milk,</ingredient> and <ingredient>saleratus,</ingredient> and is generally eaten warm. <ingredient>Indian corn</ingredient> is ground into meal of various degrees of coarseness, but is never made so fine as <ingredient>wheaten flour.</ingredient> <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> or cakes from maize require a considerably longer time to be acted upon by heat in the baking process, than <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> or <ingredient>rye.</ingredient> If ground <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> be unbolted, that is, if its bran be not separated, <ingredient>wheat meal</ingredient> or <ingredient>Graham flour</ingredient> results, from which <ingredient>Graham</ingredient> or <ingredient>dyspepsia bread</ingredient> is produced. It is made in the same general way as other <ingredient>wheaten bread,</ingredient> but requires a little peculiar management. Upon this point, Mr. Graham remarks:</p>
<p>The <ingredient>wheat meal,</ingredient> and especially if it is ground coarsely, swells considerably in the dough, and therefore the dough should not at first be made quite so stiff as that made of superfine <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> and when it is raised, if it is found too soft to mould well, a little
 
<pb n="292" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=298"/>
more meal may be added. It should be remarked that dough made of <ingredient>wheat meal</ingredient> will take on the acetous fermentation, or become sour sooner than that made of <ingredient>fine flour.</ingredient> It requires a hotter oven, and to be baked longer, but must not stand so long after being mixed before baking, as that made from <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>

<p>4. <purpose>DYSPEPTICS' BISCUIT AND COFFEE.</purpose>--Take <ingredient>Graham-flour</ingredient> (<ingredient>wheat</ingredient> coarsely ground, without bolting,) 2 qts.; <ingredient>corn meal</ingredient> sifted, 1 qt.; <ingredient>butter</ingredient> 1/2 cup; <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> 1 cup; <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> to wet it up with <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient>' as for <ingredient>biscuit.</ingredient></p>
<p>Roll out and cut with a <implement>tea-cup</implement> and bake as other <ingredient>biscuit;</ingredient> and when cold they are just the thing for dyspeptics. And if the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> was sifted, none would refuse to eat them:</p>
<p>FOR THE COFFEE.--Continue the baking of the above <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> in a slow oven for six or seven hours, or until they are browned through like <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p>
<p>DIRECTIONS.--One <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> boiled 3/4 of an hour will be plenty for 2 or 3 cups of <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> and 2, for 6 persons; serve with <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> as other <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p>
<p>Dyspeptics should chew very fine, and slowly, not drinking until the meal is over; then sip the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> at their leisure, not more than one cup, however. This will be found very nice for common use, say with one-eighth <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> added; hardly any would distinguish the difference between it and that made from <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> alone. The plan of buying ground <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is bad; much of it is undoubtedly mixed with <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> which you can raise for less than fifteen or twenty cents a pound, and mix for yourself.</p>

<p>5. <purpose>LONDON BAKER'S SUPERIOR LOAF BREAD.</purpose>--The <emph rend="italic">Michigan Farmer</emph> gives us the following; any one can see that it contains sound sense:</p>
<p>"To make a half-peck loaf, take 3/4 lb. of well boiled mealy <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> mash them through a fine <implement>cullender</implement> or coarse sieve; add 1/8 pt. of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> or 3/4 oz. of German dried-<ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and 1 3/4 pts. of luke-<ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> (88 deg.

<pb n="293" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=299"/>
The sponge so made is then to be mixed with 1 pt. of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> nearly blood warm--viz. 92 deg.

<p>The object of adding the mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> is to increase the amount of fermentation in the sponge, which it does to a very remarkable degree, and consequently, renders the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> lighter and better. The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> will also keep the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> moist.</p>

</recipe><recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>3. <purpose>APPLE PIE WHICH IS DIGESTIBLE.</purpose>--Instead of mixing up your crust with <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> making it very rich, with <ingredient>shortening,</ingredient> as customary for <ingredient>apple</ingredient> pies:</p>
<p>Mix it up every way just as you would for <ingredient>biscuit,</ingredient> using <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>saleratus,</ingredient> with a <emph rend="italic">little</emph> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter</ingredient> only; mix the dough quite stiff, roll out rather thin, lay it upon your tin, or plate; and having ripe <ingredient>apples</ingredient> sliced or chopped nicely and laid on, rather thick, and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> according to the acidity of the <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> then a top crust, and bake well, putting the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> upon the crusts, as mentioned in the "Pie Crust Glaze," and you have got a pie that is fit to eat.</p>

<p><purpose>WASHING FLUID--SAVING HALF THE WASH-BOARD LABOR.</purpose>--Sal-<ingredient>soda</ingredient> 1 lb.; <ingredient>stone lime</ingredient> 1/2 lb.; <ingredient>water</ingredient> 5 qts.; boil a short time, stirring occasionally; then let it settle and pour off the clear fluid into a stone jug and cork for use; soak your white clothes over night, in simple <ingredient>water;</ingredient> wring out, and <ingredient>soap</ingredient> wrist-bands, collars, and dirty or stained places; have your <implement>boiler</implement> half filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and when at scalding heat, put in one common <implement>tea-cup</implement> of the fluid, stir and put in your clothes, and boil for half an hour; then rub lightly through one <ingredient>suds</ingredient> only, rinsing well in the bluing <ingredient>water,</ingredient> as usual, and all is complete.</p>
<p>If you wish to wash on Monday, put warm suds to the clothes whilst breakfast is being got ready; then wring out and <ingredient>soap</ingredient> as above, will do just as well as soaking them over night, and my wife thinks better.</p>
<p>For each additional <implement>boiler</implement> of clothes add half a cup of the fluid only; of course boiling in the same <ingredient>water</ingredient> through the whole washing. If more <ingredient>water</ingredient> is needed in the <implement>boiler</implement> for the last clothes, dip it from the sudsing tub. Soak your woolen and calico in the <ingredient>suds</ingredient> from which you have
 
<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=309"/>
washed the white clothes, whilst hanging them out, dipping in some of the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> from the <implement>boiler,</implement> if necessary; then wash out the woolen and calico as usual--of course, washing out woolen goods before you do the calico. The fluid brightens instead of fading the colors in calico.</p>
<p>This plan not only saves the two rubbings which women give their clothes before boiling, and more than half of the <ingredient>soap</ingredient>--does not injure the clothes, but saves their wear in two rubbings before boiling; <variation>and is a good article <purpose>for removing grease from floors, doors, and windows, and to remove tar or grease from the hands, &#38;c.</purpose></variation></p>
<p>I hope every lady into whose hands this recipe may fall, will give it a trial, as my family have now used it over seven years, not missing only two washings. It does not rot clothes, but makes them wash full or more than one-half easier than the old way. Seven years ought to be considered a sufficient test.</p>
<p>The honor of this recipe is accredited to <attribution>Prof. Liebig, of Germany.</attribution></p>
</formula>
<p>I have found many women using turpentine, alcohol, ammonia, camphor gum, &#38;c., in their washing fluids; but none of them ought ever to be used for such purposes (one woman lost the use of her arm, for six months, by using a fluid containing turpentine); the turpentine and alcohol especially, tend to open the pores of the skin, and thus make the person more liable to take cold in hanging out the clothes, as also to weaken the arm.</p>
<p>And here let me say, if it is possible to avoid it, never allow the woman who washes the clothes, and thus becomes warm and sweaty, to hang them out; and especially ought this to be regarded in the winter or windy weather. Many consumptions are undoubtedly brought on by these frequently repeated colds, in this way. It works upon the principle that two thin shoes make one cold, two colds an attack of bronchitis, two attacks of bronchitis one consumption--the end, a coffin.</p>

<p><purpose>LIQUID BLUING--FOR CLOTHES.</purpose>--Most of the bluing sold is poor stuff, leaving specks in the clothes. To avoid this:</p>
<p>Take best <ingredient>Prussian-blue,</ingredient> pulverized, 1 oz.; <ingredient>oxalic acid,</ingredient> also pulverized, 1/2 oz.; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> 1 qt. Mix. The acid dissolves the

<p>Chinese-blue, when it can be got, is the best, and only costs one shilling an ounce, with three cents for the acid, will give better satisfaction than fifty cents worth of the common bluing. This amount has now lasted my family over a year.</p>

<p><purpose>FENCE POSTS--TO PREVENT ROTTING.</purpose>--A correspondent of the <attribution rend="italic">American Agriculturalist</attribution> says:</p>
<p>"I think it would be well to call the attention of farmers to the use of <ingredient>coal</ingredient>-tar as a paint. The <ingredient>tar</ingredient> produced in <ingredient>coal</ingredient> gas works is extensively used in England for painting fences, out-buildings, &#38;c.; and is being introduced in this country, also. It <emph rend="italic">never</emph> alters by exposure to the weather; and one or two good coats will last for many years. It is the cheapest and best black paint that can be used. Our buildings are painted with it; all our apparatus also; and even the wrought-iron pipe we place in the ground is coated with it. I think if its advantages were fully known, it would be generally used throughout the United States. The Government soak the brick used in building the fort at Throg's Neck in this <ingredient>tar,</ingredient> which renders them impervious to <ingredient>water;</ingredient> and posts painted with it are protected from rot, when in the ground, as effectually as if they had been charred."</p>
<p>I know this <ingredient>tar</ingredient> is much more effectual than charring, and is not one-tenth the trouble. There are posts near this city, which have now been set over ten years, and yet no appearance of decay. The coating is still perfect also.</p>
<p>The only objection to it as a paint above ground, is its offensive smell, from the heat of the sun.</p>
<p>No persons should allow themselves to set a single post without its application, and farmers who are putting out much fence, cannot possibly be so short-sighted as to neglect it after it once comes to their notice.</p>
<p>It is doubly important to Railroad-Companies from the fact that these roads run through the most level portions of country, and consequently the most swampy and wet, therefore fence posts are the more liable to rot. The mode of application is as follows:</p>
<p>Have a large iron kettle so arranged that you can make and keep the <ingredient>tar</ingredient> hot, then, after having removed the bark, if any, set the end of the post into the <ingredient>tar;</ingredient> and if the <ingredient>tar</ingredient> is not sufficiently deep to take the post into it as far as you wish to <ingredient>tar</ingredient> it, have a swab of cloth tied upon a broom-handle or other stick, and swab it up at least 6 to 10 inches above the ground-line when the post is set; then lift up the post, letting it drip a moment, and lay it away upon rails or poles placed for that purpose, not allowing them to touch each other until dry.</p>
<p>Two men will <ingredient>tar</ingredient> about five hundred posts in one day; and one barrel of <ingredient>tar</ingredient> will be sufficient for that number. Who then will hesitate to adopt its use? especially when the <ingredient>tar</ingredient> can be purchased at the gas-works for about two dollars per barrel.</p>

<p>The <implement>flannel</implement> can be washed occasionally, to remove the impurities collected from the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and it might be well to put a <implement>flannel</implement> between the pebbles and <implement>flannel</implement> at the bottom also.

<p><purpose>STUCCO PLASTERING--FOR BRICK AND GRAVEL HOUSES.</purpose>--First make up as much <implement>mortar</implement> as you need for the job, with good common <ingredient>lime;</ingredient> using only 3/4 or four-fifths, at most, as much <ingredient>lime</ingredient> as needed for common work--the other fourth or fifth is to be <ingredient>water-lime;</ingredient> and not to be put in only as used. The sand must be coarse, and free from loam or dirt.</p>
<p>To prepare the white and colored washes, run off common <ingredient>lime</ingredient> enough with <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> to make a white-wash to go over the whole job. This white-wash is to be colored the tint desired for the work. Be sure to make color-wash enough at one time, or you will find it hard to get the shades alike; saving a little of the white-wash without color, to pencil the seams, and also for specking, as mentioned below. The colors used are <ingredient>lamp-black,</ingredient> <ingredient>Spanish-brown,</ingredient> or <ingredient>Venetian-red,</ingredient> as preferred, and these are cut or dissolved in <ingredient>whisky;</ingredient> then putting into the <ingredient>white</ingredient>-wash to suit.</p>
 
<pb n="323" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=329"/>
<p>When these washes are all prepared, wet up as much of the <implement>mortar</implement> as can be put on in 20 to 40 minutes, and mix in the fourth or fifth of the cement, and put on as fast as possible; first wetting the wall very wet with <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Some cement will set in 20 and some in 40 to 50 minutes. When you see the time necessary for the kind you are using, act accordingly, and only mix the cement into as much <implement>mortar</implement> as your help will put on before it sets; beginning at the top of the wall with your scaffolding and working down, which prevents too much specking from the colors. Have a man to follow right after with a float, keeping the stucco very wet while floating down level and smooth; and the longer it is floated and wet, the better will be the job. Even after it is floated down well, keep a man wetting it with a brush until you get the whole line on, around the house, as the <ingredient>water</ingredient>-line must be kept quite wet for some considerable time, to set properly. Heed this caution, and if <ingredient>water</ingredient> never gets in behind the plastering from bad cornice or leaky roofs, it will never peel off. When this line of scaffolding is plastered, take out enough of the color-wash, running it through a sieve, and go over the plastering; <ingredient>lamp-black</ingredient> alone gives it a bluish slate color; if a little of the brown is added with the black, it will be a little reddish, and if the red is used without the brown, it will be quite red. I prefer sufficient of the black only to make a gray stone color. A brown, however, looks exceedingly well. If you choose, you can make one-half of the color-wash darker than the other--having laid it off into blocks resembling stone, by means of a straight-edge, and piece of board about half an inch thick, paint every other block with the darker wash to represent different shades of stone. Some of our best buildings are done in this way, and look well.</p>
<p>Then to give it a granite appearance, take a small paint-brush and dip it into the white-wash, saved for this purpose; strike it across a hammer-handle so as to throw the specks from the brush upon the wall, then the same with black and red. Pencil the seams with the white-wash, which gives it the appearance of <implement>mortar,</implement> as in real stone-work.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to move down the scaffold, and go over the same thing as before. After the colors have been dissolved with <ingredient>spirits,</ingredient> they can be reduced with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> or what is better for them and the color-wash also, is <ingredient>skimmed-milk;</ingredient> and where <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is plenty, it ought to be used in place of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> for white-wash or color-washes, as it helps to resist the weather, and prevents the colors from fading--see "Paint to Make without Lead or Oil," which gives you the philosophy of using <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Speck quite freely with the white, then about half as much with the black, and then rather free again with the red. The proportion of <ingredient>lime,</ingredient>
 
<pb n="324" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=330"/>
probably, should not exceed one, to six or seven of sand. Our University buildings, represented in the frontispiece, except the Laboratory, and Law-building, which have been more recently put up, are finished with it, and also whole blocks in the business part of our city.</p>

<p><purpose>GRAVEL HOUSES--TO MAKE--PROPORTIONS OF LIME, SAND, AND GRAVEL.</purpose>--It has become quite common to put up gravel houses; and many persons are at a great loss to know what proportion of materials to use. Various proportions have been proposed; but from the fact that the philosophy was not explained, no real light was given upon the subject.</p>
<p>All that is required to know, is, that sand and <ingredient>lime</ingredient> are to be used in proportion to the size of the gravel,--say for 15 bushels of clean gravel, from the size of <ingredient>peas</ingredient> up to that of <ingredient>hen's eggs,</ingredient> it will take about 3 bushels of clean sharp sand and 1 of <ingredient>lime</ingredient> to fill the crevices without swelling the bulk of the gravel. If the gravel is coarse, up to 5 bushels of sand may be required, but the <ingredient>lime</ingredient> will not need to be increased but very little, if any. Then the philosophy of the thing is this--about 1 to 1 1/4 bushels of <ingredient>lime</ingredient> to 15 bushels of gravel, and just sand enough to fill the crevices without increasing the bulk as above mentioned.</p>
<p>If the gravel is free of dirt, the sand also clean, and the weather dry, the walls can be raised one <ingredient>foot</ingredient> each day, if you have help to do that amount of labor.</p>
<p>Some prefer to make the gravel and sand into <implement>mortar</implement> and press it into bricks; then lay into walls, but the wall must be stronger if laid up solid, in board frames, made to raise up as required.</p>
<p>Many persons argue for the eight-square or octagon house; but I like the square form much the best, carrying up the hall and main partition walls of the same material. The eight square house looks like an old fort, or <ingredient>water</ingredient> tank, and is very expensive to finish; costing much more than the same room with square angles; for mechanics cannot put up cornice outside, or in, in less than double the time required for making the common square mitre.</p>

<p>WHITEWASHES AND CHEAP PAINTS.--<purpose>BRILLIANT STUCCO WHITEWASH--WILL LAST ON BRICK OR STONE, TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS.</purpose>--Many have heard of the brilliant stucco whitewash on the east end of the President's house at Washington. The following is a recipe for it, as gleaned from the <attribution rend="italic">National Intelligencer,</attribution> with some additional improvements learned by experiments:</p>
<p>Nice unslaked <ingredient>lime</ingredient> 1/2 bushel; slake it with <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> cover it during the process, to keep in the steam. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or strainer, and add to it, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> 1 peck; previously well dissolved in <ingredient>water;</ingredient> <ingredient>rice</ingredient> 3 lbs.--boiled to a thin <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> and stirred in boiling hot; Spanish whiting 1/2 lb.; clean nice <ingredient>glue</ingredient> 1 lb., which has been previously dissolved by soaking it well, and then hanging it over a slow fire, in a small kettle, immersed in a larger one filled with <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Now add <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> 5 gals., to the mixture, stir it well, and let it stand a few days covered from the dirt.</p>
<p>It should be put on hot. For this purpose it can be kept in a kettle on a <implement>portable furnace.</implement> Brushes more or less small may be used, according to the neatness of job required. It answers as well as <ingredient>oil</ingredient> paint for brick or stone, and is much cheaper.</p>
<p>There is one house in our city which had this applied twelve years ago, and is yet nice and bright. It has retained its brilliancy over thirty years.</p>
<p>Coloring matter, dissolved in <ingredient>whisky,</ingredient> may be put in and made of any shade you like; Spanish brown stirred in will make red-pink, more or less deep, according to quantity. A delicate tinge of this is very pretty for inside walls. Finely pulverized common <ingredient>clay,</ingredient> well mixed with <ingredient>Spanish brown,</ingredient> makes reddish stone color. <implement>Yellow-ochere</implement> stirred in makes yellow wash, but chrome goes further, and makes a color generally esteemed prettier. In all these cases the darkness of the shade, of course, is determined by the quantity of the coloring used. It is difficult to make rules, because tastes are different--it would be best to try experiments on a shingle and let it dry. Green must not be mixed with <ingredient>lime.</ingredient> The <ingredient>lime</ingredient> destroys the color, and the color
 
<pb n="326" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=332"/>
has an effect on the whitewash, which makes it crack and peel. When inside walls have been badly smoked, and you wish to make them a clean, clear white, it is well to squeeze <ingredient>indigo</ingredient> plentifully through a bag into the <ingredient>water</ingredient> you use, before it is stirred into the whole mixture, or blue vitriol pulverized and dissolved in <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and put into white-wash, gives a beautiful blue tint. If a larger quantity than five gallons be wanted, the same proportions should be observed.</p>

Make of a proper consistence to apply with a common whitewash brush.</p>
<p>Use these proportions for a greater or less amount. In England scarcely any other kind of whitewash is used.</p>

<p>There may be added any coloring matter that suits the fancy, (see the first whitewash for mixing colors,) to be applied in the same manner as other paints, and in a few hours it will become perfectly dry.

<p>"During a cruise in the South Pacific, we went into the harbor of Coquimbo; and as the ship had been out a long time, she was covered with rust from stem to stern. It was the anxious wish of the commander that she should be restored to her original colors; but on examining the store-room, it was ascertained that there was not a pound of <ingredient>white lead</ingredient> in the ship. In this emergency I bethought me of an expedient which concocted an admirable substitute, composed of the following ingredients:</p>
<p>"Air-slaked <ingredient>lime,</ingredient> pulverized until it was of the fineness of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> which was then passed through a sieve. <ingredient>Rice</ingredient> boiled in a large kettle until the substance was drawn entirely out of the grain; the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then of a plastic nature, was strained to separate the grain, &#38;c., from the clear liquid. A tub, about the size of a half barrel, of the prepared <ingredient>lime</ingredient> and <ingredient>rice-water,</ingredient> was mixed with 1 gallon of <ingredient>linseed-oil;</ingredient> and the material had so much the appearance of paint that a novice could not have told the difference.</p>
<p>"The ship was painted outside and inboard with the above mixture (which cost next to nothing,) and never presented a finer white streak on her bends, or cleaner bulwarks and berth-deck than on that occasion, and no other kind of <ingredient>white paint</ingredient> was used during the remainder of the cruise."</p>

<p><purpose>PERCUSSION MATCHES--OF THE BEST QUALITY.</purpose>--<ingredient>Chlorate of potash</ingredient> 3/4 lb.; <ingredient>glue</ingredient> 3 lbs.; <ingredient>white lead,</ingredient> dry, 5 lbs.; red <ingredient>lead</ingredient> 1/2 lb.; phosphorus 2 3/4 lbs. DIRECTIONS.--First put the chlorate into a dish made for the purpose, deep, and of a suitable size to set into a kettle of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which can be kept on the fire for 2 or 3 days, having 2 qts. of <ingredient>water on the chlorate;</ingredient> then put the <ingredient>glue</ingredient> on top of the <ingredient>chlorate water,</ingredient> and let soak until all is perfectly dissolved; then add the leads and heat up quite hot, and thoroughly mix; let cool and add the phosphorus, let it dissolve and
 
<pb n="330" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=336"/>
be careful never to heat hot after the <ingredient>phosphorus</ingredient> is added; stir occasionally while dipping, and if little particles of phosphorus fires, put it down into the mixture, or put on <ingredient>warm water;</ingredient> if you put on <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> it will fly all over you. Keep it rather thin after the phosphorus is put in, and there will be no danger; although the <ingredient>chlorate of potash</ingredient> is considered a dangerous article to work with; so is powder, yet when you know how to work with them, you can do as safely with one as the other. When dry give them a coat of varnish.</p>
<p>I have been acquainted with a man for about fourteen years who makes them, and several others for a less time, without trouble or accident. A better match was never made to stand dampness, or bear transportation without setting on fire. I have used and sold them much of the time, and speak from knowledge. One explosion has since taken place.</p>
<p>The plan pursued here in preparing the splints is as follows: Sawed pine timber from four to eight inches each way, is cut off the right length for the match, then one end of it is shaved smooth, with a drawing-knife; the block is held upon the horse by a brace from the top of the horse head against the back side of the block, so as to be out of the way of the knife instead of putting the block under the jaws of the horse head, as the dents made in the end of the match timber would not answer; the front edge comes against a strip put on for that purpose; then <ingredient>glue</ingredient> the other end and put on brown paper, which holds them together when split; machines are used to split with which feeds up the block enough each time the knife is raised, to make the size of the match when split the other way, or about ten to the inch. These machines cost about fifty dollars, and the work goes ahead like a young <implement>saw-mill,</implement> by simply turning a crank as shown in the figure.</p>
</formula>
<p>A A, shows two standards bolted upon a base plank, four feet in length; these standards support a shaft, with crank and balance wheel D, which is two feet in diameter; the shaft has upon it an oval wheel, G, which sinks the knife, F, twice in each revolution, the knife passing down through a space in a thin iron strip, H, standing out from the two blocks, C C, under which the match block passes by the drawing of the chain seen to pass over a small drum, P, upon the shaft of the rag wheel, B, the notches being only one-fourth inch apart, and fed up by the hand, M, attached to
 
<pb n="331" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=337"/>
the iron frame, L, being kept back to the cam wheel, E, which has two swells upon it, by a light spring which is not shown.
<illustration><caption>MATCH SPLITTING MACHINE.</caption><description>An illustration of a complex machine, consisting of a number of rods, saws, wheels, and blades set in a rectangular table. Parts of the machine of are labeled with capital letters.</description></illustration>
The hand, M, is kept down into the cogs or notches by the little spiral wire spring, K; the match block, to be split, sets in the frame forward of the block, I, which has a pin in it to draw back the frame. When the block of matches is split, this frame goes forward to touch a catch, the same as a <implement>saw-mill,</implement> which lets another spring not seen, raise the hand, M, when the feeding operation ceases. The frame is then drawn back and the same repeated. As the match is split they open and require a rounding mortise made through the base plank between the blocks, C C, which allows them to remain in a half circular form--the knife is raised by a line attached to a spring pole, T, the knife is screwed upon a piece of cast iron which works in the guide, N, having the back end firmly fastened by a bolt through the standard, O. This knife stands at right angles with the shaft. When the matches are split and sufficiently dry to work upon, they are dipped in melted brimstone, kept hot, and the match also kept hot on a sheet iron stove, and all the brimstone is thrown off which can possibly be by jerking the block with the hand. If any brimstone remains upon the end it must be scraped off before dipping into the match composition. Without the chlorate, the composition makes a first class

<p>It was stated by Mr. Hyatt, that, from experiments he had made, this great increase of pressure could be obtained in <emph rend="italic">six to seven minutes,</emph> with an engine at rest. This rapid doubling of pressure, with but a small increase of heat, is due to the conversion of what is termed latent heat, in steam, into sensible heat. If we immerse a thermometer into boiling water, it stands at 212; if we place it in steam immediately above the water, it indicates the same temperature. The question then arises, what becomes of all the heat which is communicated to the water,
 
<pb n="333" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=339"/>
since it is neither indicated by the water nor by the steam formed from it? The answer is, it enters the water and converts it into steam without raising its temperature. One <emph rend="italic">thousand</emph> degrees of heat are absorbed in the conversion of water into steam, and this is called its <emph rend="italic">latent</emph> heat. And it is the <emph rend="italic">sudden</emph> conversion of <emph rend="italic">latent</emph> heat into <emph rend="italic">sensible</emph> heat that produces the explosion. If an engine is stopped, even if there is but a moderate fire, if the escape valve is closed, there is a rapid absorption or accumulation of latent heat. The pressure rises with great rapidity, and when the engineer thinks everything is safe, the explosion comes.</p>
<p>That this is the true cause of nearly all the explosions that occur, will be plain to every one who will look at the relations between latent and sensible heat. Prof. Henry and Prof. Silliman, Jr., endorse the view. What, then, is the security against explosions? We know of no securities but these--a sufficiency of water in the <implement>boilers,</implement> and the <emph rend="italic">escape valves open</emph> at light pressure, when the engine is at rest.--<emph rend="italic">Springfield Republican.</emph></p>
<p>There is no question about the foregoing explanations being founded in <emph rend="italic">true</emph> philosophy; and if engineers will be <emph rend="italic">governed</emph> by them, instead of by a desire to hold on to steam for the purpose of getting <emph rend="italic">ahead</emph> or of <emph rend="italic">keeping</emph> ahead, as the case may be, of some other boat; or on land, to save the expense of fuel, not <emph rend="italic">one</emph> explosion would take place where now there is, at least, a <emph rend="italic">hundred.</emph></p>
<p>Awful will be the reckoning with these <emph rend="italic">murderers;</emph> for in Heaven's sight they are one and the same.</p>
<p>A series of experiments have recently been concluded on the U.S. <implement>Steamer</implement> Michigan, and a full but voluminous report laid before the Navy Department, upon the subject of steam expansion. It would pay all interested in steam works to obtain and read it.</p>

<p>ADVICE--TO YOUNG MEN AND OTHERS, OUT OF EMPLOYMENT.--ADVICE--How few there are that will hear advice at all; not because it is advice, but from the fact that those who attempt to give it are not qualified for the work they assume; or that they endeavor to thrust it upon their notice at an inappropriate time; or upon persons over whom no control is acceded, if claimed. But a book or paper never give offense from any of these causes; therefore, they are always welcomed with a hope that real benefit may be derived from their suggestions. Whether that end will be attained in this case, I leave to the judgment of those for whom it is intended; hoping they may find themselves sufficiently interested to give it a careful perusal, and candid consideration. And although my remarks must, in this work, be necessarily short, yet every sentence shall be a text for your own thoughts to contemplate and enlarge upon; and perhaps, in some future edition of the work, I may take room and time to give the subject that attention which is really its due; and which would be a pleasure to devote to its consideration.</p>
<p>First, then, let me ask why are so many young men and other persons out of employment? The answer is very positive as well as very plain. It is this--indolence, coupled with a determination that they will do some <emph rend="italic">great</emph> thing, only. And because that great thing does not turn up without effort, they are doing nothing. The point of difficulty is simply this; they look for the end, before the beginning. But just consider how few there are that really accomplish any great thing, even with a whole life of industry and economical perseverance. And yet most of our <emph rend="italic">youth</emph> calculate that their <emph rend="italic">beginning</emph> shall be amongst the <emph rend="italic">greats.</emph> But as no one comes to offer them their expectations, indolence says wait;
 
<pb n="337" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=343"/>
and so they are still waiting. Now mind you, as long as your expectations are placed upon a chance offer of something very remunerative, or upon the assistance of others; even in a small way, so long will you continue to wait in vain. At this point, then, the question would arise, what can be done? and the answer is equally plain with the other. Take hold of the first job you can find, for it will not find you. No matter how insignificant it may be, it will be better than longer idleness; and when you are seen doing something for yourselves, by those whose opinions are worth any consideration, they will soon offer you more and better jobs; until, finally, you will find something which agrees with your taste or inclination, for a life business. But remember that the <emph rend="italic">idle</emph> never have good situations offered them. It is the industrious and persevering only, who are needed to assist in life's great struggle.</p>
<p>There are a few lines of poetry called "The Excellent Man," which advocates the principles I am endeavoring to advance, so admirably that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of quoting them. The old proverb, "God helps those who help themselves," is as true as it is old, and after all that is said and done, in this country, if in no other, a man must depend on his own exertions, not on patronage, if he would have or deserve success:</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">"They gave me advice and counsel in store,<lb/>Praised me and honored me more and more<lb/>Said that I only should 'wait awhile,'<lb/>Offered their patronage, too, with a smile.</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">But with all their honor and approbation,<lb/>I should long ago have died of starvation,<lb/>Had there not come an <emph rend="italic">excellent</emph> man,<lb/>Who, bravely to help me along began.</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">Good-fellow! he got me the food I ate,<lb/>His kindness and care I shall never forget;<lb/>Yet I cannot embrace him--though other folks can,<lb/>For I, <emph rend="italic">myself,</emph> am this excellent man!"</p>
<p>Up, then, and at it, for there is</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">Knitting and sewing, and reaping and mowing<lb/>And all kinds of work for the people to do,<lb/>To keep themselves busy, both Abram and Lizzie;<lb/>Begin, then, ye idle, there is plenty for you.</p>
<p>When you have found a situation or a job of work, prove
 
<pb n="338" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=344"/>
yourself honest, industrious, persevering, and faithful in every trust, and no fears need be apprehended of your final success. Save a part of your wages as a sinking fund, or rather as a floating fund, which shall keep your head above water in a storm; or to enable you, at no distant day, to commence a business of your own.</p>
<p>A poor orphan boy, of fourteen, once resolved to save half of his wages, which were only four dollars per month, for this purpose; and actually refused, even in sickness, although really suffering for comforts, to touch this business fund. He was afterwards the richest man in St. Louis.</p>
<p>His advice to young men was always this: "Go to work; save half your wages; no matter how small they may be, until you have what will enable you to begin what you wish to follow; then begin it, stick to it; be economical, prudent, and careful, and you cannot fail to prosper."</p>
<p>My advice is the same, with this qualification, however; that in choosing your occupation, you should be governed by the eternal principles of right! never choosing that which, when done, injures a fellow creature more than it can possibly benefit yourself--I mean the liquor traffic. But with the feeling of St. Paul, when he saw the necessity of doing something different from what he had been doing, he cried out, "Lord, what wilt thou have me do?" Ask your own tastes, being governed by conscience, under the foregoing principles; knowing that if a person has to learn a trade or business <emph rend="italic">against</emph> his own inclination, it requires double dilligence to make only half speed, and hardly ever meeting with success.</p>
<p>The question to be settled, then, is this: Shall I work the soil: Shall I be a mechanic, teacher, divine, physician, lawyer, merchant, druggist, or grocer, or shall it be something else? Whenever you make up your mind what it shall be, make it up, also, to be the best one in that line of business. Set your mark high, both in point of moral purity and literary qualifications.</p>
<p>If you choose any of the occupations of trade, you must save all that it is possible for economy and prudence to do, for your beginning.</p>
<p>But if you choose one of the learned professions, you must work with the same care and prudence until you have
 
<pb n="339" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=345"/>
accumulated sufficient to make a fair commencement in your studies; then prosecute them in all faithfulness as far as the accumulated means will advance you; realizing that this increase of knowledge will give you increased power in obtaining the further means of prosecuting your studies, necessary to qualify you to do one thing only in life.</p>
<p>Nearly all of our best men are self-made, and men of one idea, <emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> they have set themselves to be mechanics, physicians, lawyers, sculptors, &#38;c., and have bent their whole energies and lives to fit themselves for the great work before them. Begin, then; offer no excuse. Be sure you are on the right track, then go ahead:</p>
<p align="indent1" size="smaller">"Live for something;" slothful be no longer, look around for some employ;<lb/>Labor always makes you stronger, and also gives you sweetest joy.<lb/>Idle hands are always weary; faithful hearts are always gay;<lb/>Life for us, should not be dreary; not can it, to the active, every day.</p>
<p>Always remembering that industry, in study or labor, will keep ahead of his work, giving time for pleasure and enjoyment; but indolence is ever behind; being driven with her work, and no prospect of its ever being accomplished.</p>
<p>When you have made your decision, aside from what time you must necessarily devote to labor, let all possible time be given to the study of the best works upon the subject of your occupation or profession, knowing that one hour's reading in the morning, when the mind is calm and free from fatigue, thinking and talking with your companions through the day upon the subjects of which you have been reading, will be better than twice that time in evening reading, yet if both can be enjoyed, so much the better; but one of them must certainly be occupied in this way.</p>
<p>If you choose something in the line of mercantile or trade life, do not put off, too long, commencing for yourself. Better begin in a small way and learn, as your capital increases, how to manage a larger business.</p>
<p>I knew a gentleman to commence a business with five dollars, and in two weeks his capital was seventeen dollars, besides feeding his family.</p>
<p>I knew one also to begin with sixty dollars, and in fifteen months he cleared over four hundred and fifty dollars, besides supporting his family; then he sold out and lost all, before he again got into successful business.</p>

<p>Those who choose a professional life, will hardly find a place in the West, equal to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to obtain their literary qualifications. An entrance fee of Ten Dollars, with Five Dollars yearly, pays for a full Literary, Law, Medical, or Civil Engineering course; the first requiring four, the two next, two, and the last, three years. [See Frontispiece.]</p>
<p>Or, in the words of the Catalogue: "The University, having been endowed by the General Government, affords education, without money and without price. There is no young man, so poor, that industry, diligence, and perseverance, will not enable him to get an education here.</p>
<p>"The present condition of the University confirms this view of its character. While the sons of the rich, and of men of more or less property, and, in large proportion, the sons of substantial farmers, mechanics, and merchants, are educated here, there is also a very considerable number of young men dependent <emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> upon their own exertions--young men who, accustomed to work on the farm, or in the mechanic's shop, have become smitten with the love of knowledge, and are manfully working their way through, to a liberal education, by appropriating a portion of their time to the field or the workshop."</p>
<p>Persons wishing to qualify themselves for teaching in this State, will find the Normal School Ypsilanti, undoubtedly preferable.</p>
<p>And that none may excuse themselves from an effort because somewhat advanced in life, let me say that Doctor Eberle, who wrote several valuable medical works, did not begin his medical studies until forty-five years of age; and, although I could mention many more, I will only add that I, myself, always desired to become a physician, yet circumstances did not favor nor justify my commencement until I was thirty-eight. See the remarks following "Eye Water."</p>
<p>There is no occupation, however, so free and independent as that of the farmer; and there is none, except parents, capable of using so great an influence, for good or for evil, as that of teacher.</p>
<p>All might and ought, to a greater or less extent, be farmers; but all cannot be teachers. Then let those whose
 
<pb n="341" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=347"/>
taste inclines them to teach, not shrink the responsibility, but fully qualify for the work; learning also the ways of Truth and Righteousness for themselves; teaching it through the week-school, by action as well as by word, and in the Sabbath-school, fail not to take their stand for the right, like our President <emph rend="italic">elect;</emph> then when it comes your turn to assist in the government of the State, or Nation, the people will come to your support, as you do to your work--as they have just done to his, (1860); feeling, as now, that the government must be safe in the hands of those who love God--deal honestly with their fellows; and who, in remembering the Sabbath to keep it holy themselves, are not ashamed--nor forget, to teach the children to love the same God, and reverence His Word. Only think--a Sabbath-School Teacher--<emph rend="italic">a Rail-Splitter--a Boat-man,</emph> President of the United States!</p>
<p>Who will hereafter be afraid of common labor; or, let indolence longer prevent their activity? when it is only those who begin with <emph rend="italic">small</emph> things, and persevere <emph rend="italic">through</emph> life, that reach the final goal of greatness; and, as in this case, are crowned with the greatest honor which man can receive--the <emph rend="italic">confidence</emph> of his Nation.</p>
<p>Then let <emph rend="italic">Industry</emph> take the place of <emph rend="italic">Indolence,</emph> beginning to be great, by grappling with the small things of life--be faithful to yourself, and, you may reasonably expect, the end shall, indeed, be great.</p>
<p>And although it could not be expected, in a work of this kind, that much could, or would be said, directly, regarding a future life, yet I should be recreant to duty if I did not say a word more upon that subject. It shall be only a word: Be as faithful to GOD, as I have recommended you to be to yourselves, and all things pertaining to a future, will be equally prosperous, and glorious in its results.</p>

<p>MUSICAL CURIOSITY--SCOTCH GENIUS IN TEACHING.--A Highland piper, having a scholar to teach, disdain to crack his brains with the names of semibreves, minims, crotchets and quavers. "Here, Donald," said he, "tak yer pipes, lad, and gie us a blast. So--verra weel blawn, indeed; but what's a sound, Donald, without sense? Ye maun blaw forever without making a tune o't, if I dinna tell you how the queer things on the paper maun help you. You see that big fellow wi'a round, open face? (pointing to a semibreve between two lines of a bar). He moves slowly from that line to this, while ye beat ane wi' yer fist, and gie us a long blast. If, now, yet put a let to him, ye mak' twa o'him, and he'll move twice as fast; and if ye black his face, he'll fun four times faster than the fellow wi' the white face; but if, after blacking his face, yell bend his knee or tie his leg, he'll hop eight times faster than the white-faced chap I showed you first. Now, whene'er ye blaw yer pipes, Donald, remember this--that the tighter those fellows' legs are tied, the faster they'll run, and the quicker they're sure to dance."</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">COLORING DEPARTMENT.</hd>
<p>REMARKS.--It may be necessary to remark, and I do it here, once for all, that every article to be dyed, as well as everything used about dyeing, should be perfectly clean.</p>
<p>In the next place, the article to be dyed should be well scoured in soap, and then the soap rinsed out. It is also an advantage to dip the article you wish to dye into warm water, just before putting it into the alum or other preparation; for the neglect of this precaution it is nothing uncommon to have the goods or yarn spotted. <emph rend="italic">Soft</emph> water should always be used, if possible, and sufficient to cover the goods handsomely.</p>
<p>As soon as an article is dyed it should be aired a little, then well rinsed, and afterwards hung up to dry.</p>
<p>When dyeing or scouring silk or merino dresses, care should be taken not to wring them, for this has a tendency to wrinkle and break the silk.</p>
<p>In putting dresses and shawls out to dry, that have been dyed, they should be hung up by the edge so as to dry evenly.</p>
<p>Great confidence may be placed in these coloring recipes, as the author has had them revised by Mr. Storms, of this city, who has been in the business over thirty years.</p>

After you have all the acid in, let the bottle stand until the ebullition subsides; then stop it up with a bees-wax or <implement>glass stopper,</implement> and set it away, and it will keep good for a year or more, or will be fit for use in 24 hours.</p>

<formula class="household">
<p>5. <purpose>SPOTS--TO REMOVE AND PREVENT WHEN COLORING BLACK ON SILK OR WOOLEN.</purpose>--N.B. In dyeing silk or woolen goods, if they should become rusty or spotted, all that is necesary is to make a weak-lye, and have it scalding hot, and put your goods in for 15 minutes; or throw some <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> into your dye, and run your goods in it 5 minutes, and they will come out a jet black, and an even color. I will warrant it.--<emph rend="italic">Storms.</emph></p>
<p>The reason that spots of brown, or rust, as it is generally called, appear on black cloths, is that these parts take the color faster than the other parts; but I have no doubt Mr. Storms' plan will remove them, for he regretted much to make public the information, which he says is not generally known. And if the precaution, given in our leading remarks on coloring, are heeded, there will be but very little danger of spotting at all.</p>

<section class1="generalnonfood">
<p>INTEREST--LEGAL RATES ALLOWED IN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT STATES; ALSO, SHOWING WHAT RATES MAY BE CONTRACTED FOR, AND COLLECTED; AND GIVING THE FORFEITURES WHEN ILLEGAL RATES ARE ATTEMPTED TO BE COLLECTED.--FIRST, then <emph rend="italic">Six</emph> per cent is the <emph rend="italic">Legal</emph> rate in the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, (<emph rend="italic">Eight</emph> per cent. is allowed in this State if agreed upon), Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and New Jersey, excepting, in Hudson and Essex Counties, and the city of Patterson, in this last State, <emph rend="italic">Seven</emph> per cent. is allowed, when either of the parties reside therein.</p>
<p>SECOND; <emph rend="italic">Seven</emph> per cent. is the <emph rend="italic">Legal</emph> rate in Michigan, New York, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Carolina, and Georgia.</p>
<p>THIRD; <emph rend="italic">Ten</emph> per cent. is the <emph rend="italic">Legal</emph> rate in California; <emph rend="italic">Eight</emph> per cent. in Alabama and Texas, and as strange as it may appear, in Louisiana only <emph rend="italic">Five</emph> per cent.</p>
<p>Maine and Vermont allow no higher than legal interest to be collected, even if agreed upon. And if paid it can be recovered again, but no forfeiture.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, three times the legal rate is forfeited, if unlawfully taken.</p>
<p>Rhode Island, has no forfeiture, but allows legal interest to be collected, even on usurious contracts.</p>
<p>In Connecticut, if usurious contracts are made, the principle only can be collected, to the lender, or, if collected, can be recovered, one-half to the informer, the other half to the State Treasury.</p>
<p>New York voids usurious contracts; but, if paid, only allows the excess over legal rates to be collected back.</p>
<p>New Jersey, also, voids usurious contracts, reserving half to the State, and half to the informer.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania allows only legal interest to be collected.</p>
 
<pb n="353" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=359"/>
<p>Delaware allows usurious contracts to be collected, half to the State and half to the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Maryland allows only legal rates to be collected.</p>
<p>Virginia voids the contract, and doubles the debt, half to the informer and half to the State.</p>
<p>North Carolina is the same as Virginia.</p>
<p>South Carolina, Florida, and Alabama, allow forfeitures of only the interest.</p>
<p>In Mississippi, although <emph rend="italic">six</emph> per cent. is the legal interest on common debts, yet for money, actually borrowed, <emph rend="italic">eight</emph> per cent is allowed, and although a rate may be agreed upon above what the law allows, simple interest may still be collected.</p>
<p>Louisiana, although allowing only <emph rend="italic">five</emph> per cent. where no stipulation is made, permits <emph rend="italic">eight</emph> per cent. in agreement, and Bank interest to be <emph rend="italic">six</emph> per cent.</p>
<p>In Texas, although <emph rend="italic">eight</emph> per cent. only is the legal rate, yet <emph rend="italic">twelve</emph> may be contracted for, but if higher rates are agreed upon, none can be collected.</p>
<p>Arkansas allows as high as <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. on contract, but voids unsurious contracts.</p>
<p>Tennessee allows a fine to be collected not less in amount than is unlawfully taken.</p>
<p>Kentucky only voids usurious excesses.</p>
<p>Michigan and Ohio allow <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. to be contracted for, and void only excesses, if any are taken.</p>
<p>Indiana allows only her legal rates to be contracted for, and may be collected back, if, in any case, it should be obtained.</p>
<p>Illinois allows <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. on money, actually borrowed, and only lawful rates can be collected.</p>
<p>In Missouri, <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. may be contracted for, but forfeits <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. to the common school fund, in cases where more than lawful rates are obtained.</p>
<p>Iowa permits <emph rend="italic">ten</emph> per cent. to be agreed upon, and allows all illegal interest to be collected back.</p>
 
<pb n="354" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=chas&#38;PageNum=360"/>
<p>Wisconsin permits <emph rend="italic">twelve</emph> per cent. to be agreed upon, and those who have paid more than lawful rates may recover back three times the amount paid.</p>
<p>California and Minnesota allow any rate agreed upon to be collected.</p>
<p>The interest which the State allows to be collected on notes drawn, "with use," not specifying the rate, is called <emph rend="italic">legal,</emph> and that which some States allow to be contracted for, above the <emph rend="italic">legal</emph> rate is <emph rend="italic">lawful;</emph> but when a larger rate is taken, or agreed upon, it is called <emph rend="italic">usurious,</emph> and subjects the person agreeing for it, or receiving it, to the <emph rend="italic">penalties, or forfeitures,</emph> as given in the foregoing explanations.</p>

<p>In the same manner, proceed with any other amounts, or any other time, or rate per cent.; and if for more than one year, multiply the interest for 1 year by the number of years for which the interest is sought; if for twenty, thirty, sixty, or any other amount between ten and one hundred dollars, multiply the interest on ten dollars, by the number of tens in the amount, which gives you the whole sum of interest sought; the same rule holds good on hundreds, between one hundred and one thousand, and also, on thousands.</p>
<p>To find interest at 5 per cent, take one-half of the 10 per cent rate.</p>
<p>And, of course, the principle works the same on all of the tables, for the different rates of per cent.</p>

<p>Again, for persons in advanced life, say from 60 years, the dose must begin to lessen about 5 grains, and from that on, 5 grains for each additional 10 years.</p>
<p>Females, however, need a little less, generally than males.</p>
