<hd rend="ornate" align="center">Familiar Talk with my fellow-housekeepers and Reader.</hd>
<p>
A TALK as woman to woman, in which each shall say, "I" and "you" and "my dear," and "you know" as freely as she pleases. It would not be a womanly chat if we omitted these forms of expression. An informal preface to what I mean shall be an informal book-bristling with "I's" all the way through. If said bristles offend the critic's touch, let him remember that this work is not prepared for the library, but for readers who trouble themselves little about editorial "we's" and the circumlocutions of literary modesty.
</p>
<p>
I wish it were in my power to bring you, the prospective owner of this volume, in person, as I do in spirit, to my side on this winter evening, when the bairnies are "folded like the flocks;" the orders for breakfast com-mitted to the keeping of Bridget, or Gretchen, or Chloe, or the plans for the morrow definitely laid in the brain of that ever-busy, but most independent of women, the housekeeper who "does her own work." I should perhaps summon to our cozy conference a very weary companion-weary of foot, of hand-and I should not deserve to be your confidant, did I not know how often heart-weary with discouragement; with much producing of ways and means; with a certain despondent looking forward to the monotonous grinding of who household machine; to the certainty, proved by past experience,
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=12"/>
that toilsome as has been this day, the morrow will prove yet more abundant in labors, in trials of strength, and nerves, and temper. You would tell me what a dreary problem this of "woman's work that is never done" is to your fainting soul; how, try as you may and as you do to be systematic and diligent, something is always "turning up" in the treadmill to keep you on the strain; how you often say to yourself, in bitterness of spirit, that it is a mistake of Christian civilization to educate girls into a love of science and literature, and then condemn them to the routine of a domestic drudge. You do not see, you say, that years of scholastic training will make you a better cook, a better wife or mother. You have seen the time-nay many times, since assuming your present position-when you would have exchanged your knowledge of ancient and modern languages, belles-lettres, music, and natural science, for the skill of a competent kitchen-maid, The "learning how" is such hard work! Labor, too, uncheered by encouraging words from mature housewives, unsoftened by sympathy even from your husband, or your father or brother, or whoever may be the "one" to whom you "make home lovely." It may be that, in utter discouragement, you have made up your mind that you have "no talent for these things."
</p>
<p>
I have before me now the picture of a wife, the mother of four children, who, many years ago, sickened me for all time with that phrase. In a slatternly morning-gown at four in the afternoon, leaning back in the laziest and most ragged of rocking-chairs, dust on the carpet, on the open piano, the mantel, the mirrors, even on her own hair, she rubbed the soft palm of one band with the grimy fingers of the other, and with a sickly-sweet smile whined out-
</p>
<p>
"Now, I am one of the kind who have no talent for such things I The kitchen and housework and sewing are absolutely hateful to me-utterly uncongenial to my turn
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=13"/>
of mind. The height of my earthly ambition is to have nothing to do but to paint on velvet all day!"
</p>
<p>
I felt then, in the height of my indignant disgust, that there was propriety as well as wit in the "Spectator's" suggestion that every young woman should, before fixing the wedding-day, be compelled by law to exhibit to inspectors a prescribed number of useful articles as her outfit-napery, bed-linen, clothing, etc., made by her own hands, and that it would be wise legislation which should add to these proofs of her fitness for her new sphere a practical knowledge of housework and cookery.
</p>
<p>
If you have not what our Yankee grandmothers termed a "faculty" for housewifery-yet are obliged, as is the case with an immense majority of American women, to conduct the affairs of a household, bills of fare included- there is the more reason for earnest application to your profession. If the natural taste be dull, lay to it more strength of will-resolution born of a just sense of the importance of the knowledge and dexterity you would acquire. Do not scoff at the word "profession." Call not that common and unclean which Providence has designated as your life-work. I speak not now of the labors of the culinary department alone; but, without naming the other duties which you and you only can perform, I do insist that upon method skill, economy in the kitchen, depends so much of the well-being of the rest of the household, that it may safely be styled the root-the foundation of housewifery. I own it would be pleasanter in most cases, especially to those who have cultivated a taste for intellectual pursuits, to live above the heat and odor of this department. It must be very fine to have an efficient aide-de-camp in the person of a French cook, or a competent sub-manager, or an accomplished head-waiter who receives your orders for the day in vour boudoir or library, and executes the same with zeal
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=14"/>
and discretion that leave you no room for anxiety or regret Such mistresses do not need cookery-books. The few-and it must be borne in mind that in this country these are 
<emph rend="italic">very</emph> few-born in an estate like this would not comprehend what I am now writing ; would not enter into the depths of that compassionate yearning which moves me as I think of what I have known for myself in the earlier years of my wedded life, what I have heard and seen in ether households of honest intentions brought to contempt; of ill-directed toil; of mortification, and the heavy, wearing sense of inferiority that puts the novice at such a woful disadvantage in. a community of notable managers.
</p>
<p>
There is no use in enlarging upon this point. You and I might compare experiences by the hour without exhaust-big our store.
</p>
<p>
"And then"-you sigh, with a sense of resentment upon you, however amiable your disposition, for the provocation is dire-"cookery-books and young housekeepers assistants, and all that sort of thing, are such humbugs!- dark lanterns at best-too often Will-o'-the-wisps."
</p>
<p>
My dear, would you mind handing me the book which lies nearest you on the table there? "Dickens?" Of course. You will usually find something of his in every room in this house-almost as surely as you will a Bible-It rests and refreshes one to pick him up at odd times, and dip in anywhere. Hear the bride, Mrs. John Rokesmith, upon our common grievance.
</p>
<p>
"She was under the constant necessity of referring for advice and support to a sage volume, entitled 'The Complete British Family Housewife,' which she would sit consulting, with her elbows upon the table, and her temples in her hands, like some perplexed enchantress poring over the Black Art. This, principally because the Complete British Housewife, however sound a Briton at heart, was by no
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=15"/>
means an expert Briton at expressing herself with clearness in the British tongue, and sometimes might have issued her directions to equal purpose in the Kamtchatkan language."
</p>
<p>
Don't interrupt me, my long-suffering sister! There is more of the same sort to come.
</p>
<p>
"There was likewise a coolness on the part of 'The Complete British Housewife' which Mrs. John Rokesmith found highly exasperating. She would say, 'Take a salamander,' as if a general should command a private to catch a Tartar. Or, she would casually issue the order, Throw in a handful' of something entirely unattainable. In these, the housewife's most glaring moments of unreason, Bella would shut her up and knock her on the table, apostrophizing her with the compliment-'O you ARE a stupid old donkey! Where am I to get it, do you think?'"
</p>
<p>
When I took possession of my first real home, the prettily furnished cottage to which I came as a bride, more full of hope and courage than if I had been wiser, five good friends presented me with as many cookery-books, each complete, and all by different compilers. One day's investigation of my menage convinced me that my lately-hired servants knew no more about cookery than I did, or affected stupidity to develop my capabilities or ignorance. Too proud to let them suspect the truth, or to have it bruited abroad as a topic for pitying or contemptuous gossip, I shut myself up with my "Complete Housewives," and inclined seriously to the study of the same, comparing one with the other, and seeking to shape a theory which should grow into practice in accordance with the best authority. I don't like to remember that time! The question of disagreeing doctors, and the predicament of falling between two stools, are trivial perplexities when compared with my strife and failure.
</p>
<p>
Said the would-be studious countryman to whom a mischievous
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=16"/>
acquaintance lens "Webster's Unabridged Dictionary" as an entertaining volume, "I wrastled, and I wrastled, 
<emph rend="italic">and</emph> I wrastled with it, but I couldn't get up much of an interest."
</p>
<p>
My wrestling begat naught save pitiable confusion, hope less distress, and a three-days' sick headache, during which season I am not sure that I did not darkly contemplate suicide as the only euro escape from the meshes that girt me. At the height--or depth-of my despondency &#38; friend, one with a great heart and steady brain, came to my rescue, Her cheerful laugh over my dilemma rings down to me now, through all these years, refreshingly as it then saluted my ears
</p>
<p>
"Bless your innocent little heart!" she cried, in her fresh, gay voice, "Ninety-nine out of a hundred cook-books are written by people who never kept bouse, and the hundredth by a good cook who yet doesn't know how to express herself to the enlightenment of others. Compile a receipt-book for yourself. Make haste slowly. Learn one thing at a time, and when you have mastered it, 'make a note on it,' as Captain Cuttle says-never losing sight of the principle that you 
<emph rend="italic">must do it in order to learn how."</emph>
</p>
<p>
Then she opened to me her own neatly-written "Manual"-the work of years, recommending, as I seized it, that I should commence my novitiate with simple dishes.
</p>
<p>
This was the beginning of the hoard of practical receipts I now offer for your inspection. For fifteen years, I have steadily pursued this work, gleaning here and sifting there, and levying such remorseless contributions upon my friends that I fear the sight of my paper and pencil has long since become a bugbear. For the kindness and courtesy which have been my invariable portion in this quest, I hereby re turn hearty thanks. For the encouraging words and good wishes that have ever answered the hint of my intention to
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=17"/>
collect what had proved so valuable to me into a printed volume, I declare myself to be yet more a debtor. I da not claim for my compend the proud pre-eminence of the "Complete American Housewife." It is no boastful system of "Cookery Taught in Twelve Lessons," And I should write myself down a knave or a fool, -were I to assert that a raw cook or ignorant mistress can, by half-a-day's study of my collection, equal Soyer or Blot, or even approximate the art of a half-taught scullion.
</p>
<p>
We may as well start from the right point, if we hope to continue friends. You must learn the rudiments of the art for yourself. Practice, and practice alone, will teach you certain essentials. The management of the ovens, the requisite thickness of boiling custards, the right shade of brown upon bread and roasted meats-these and dozens of other details are hints which cannot he imparted by written or oral instructions. But, once learned, they are never forgotten, and henceforward your fate is in your own hand.  You are mistress of yourself, though servants leave. Have faith in your own abilities. You 
<emph rend="italic">will</emph> be a better cook for the mental training you have received at school and from books. Brains tell everywhere, to say nothing of intelligent observation, just judgment, a faithful memory and orderly habits. Consider that you have a profession, as I said just now, and resolve to understand it in all its branches. My book is designed to help you. I believe it will, if for no other reason because it has been a faithful guide to myself-a reference beyond value in seasons of doubt and need. I have brought every receipt to the test of common sense and experience. Those which I have not tried myself were obtained from reliable housewives-the best I know. I have enjoyed the task heartily, and from first to last the persuasion has never left me that I was engaged in a good cause. Throughout I have had you,"my dear sister, present
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=18"/>
before me, with the little plait between your brows, the wistful look about eye and mouth that reveal to me, a words could not, your desire to "do your best,"
</p>
<p>
"In a humble home, and in a humble way," I hear you add, perhaps: you "are not ambitious;" you "only want to help John, and to make him and the children comfortable and happy."
</p>
<p>
Heaven reward your honest, loyal endeavors! Would you mind if I were to whisper a word in your ear I don't care to have progressive people hear?-although progress is a grand thing when it takes the right direction. My dear, John and the children, and the humble home, make your sphere for the present, you say. Be sure you fill it- 
<emph rend="italic">full!</emph> before you seek one wider and higher. There is no better receipt between these covers than that. Leave the rest to God. Everybody knows those four lines of George Herbert's, which ought to be framed and hung up in the work-room of every house :-
</p>
<p>
"A servant, with this clause,<lb/> Makes drudgery divine;<lb/>Who sweeps a room as for Thy laws<lb/> Makes that and th' action fine."
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the sainted poet knows-in that land where drudgery is one of the rough places forever overpast, and work is unmingled blessing-to how many sad and striving hearts those words have brought peace ?
</p>
<p>
And by way of helping John, not only by saving money and preparing palatable and wholesome dishes for his table, but by sparing the wife he loves many needless steps and much hurtful care, will you heed a homely hint or two relative to the practice of your art? Study method, and economy of time and strength, no less than of materials. I take it for granted that you are too intelligent to share in the vulgar prejudice against labor-saving machines. A
<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=19"/>
raisin-seeder costs a trifle in comparison with the time and patience required to stone the fruit in the old way. A 
<emph rend="italic">good</emph> egg-beater is a treasure. So with farina-kettles, syllabub churns, apple-corers, potato-peelers and slicers, clothes-wringers and sprinklers, and the like. Most of these are made of tin-are therefore cheap and easily kept clean. Let each article have its own place in the closet and kitchen, to which restore it so soon as you have done using it. Before undertaking the preparation of any dish, road over the receipt carefully, unless you are thoroughly familiar with the manufacture of it. Many excellent housewives have a fashion of saying loftily, when asked how such things are made-"I carry all my receipts in my head. I never wrote out one in my life."
</p>
<p>
And you, if timid and self-distrustful, are smitten with shame, keep your receipt-book out of sight, and cram your memory with ingredients and measures, times and weighty for fear Mrs. Notable should suspect you of rawness and inefficiency. Whereas the truth is, that if you have a, mind worthy of the name, its powers are too valuable to bo laden. with such details. Master the general principles, as I said just now, and for particulars look to your marching-orders. Having refreshed your memory by this reference, pick out from your household stores, arid set in convenient order, within reach of your hand, everything you will need in making ready the particular compound under consideration. Then take your stand in the midst-or sit, if you can. It is common sense-oftentimes a pious duty, to take judicious care of your physical health. I lay it down as a safe and imperative rule for kitchen use-<emph rend="italic">Never stand when you can do your work as well while sitting.</emph> If I could have John's ear for a minute, I would tell him that which would lead him to watch you and exercise wholesome authority in this regard.
</p>
<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=20"/>
<p>
Next, prepare each ingredient for mixing, that the bread, cake, pudding, soup? or ragout may not be delayed when half finished because the flour is not sifted, or the "shortening" warmed, the sugar and butter are not creamed, the meat not cut up, or the herbs not minced. Don't begin until you are ready; then go steadily forward, "without haste, without rest," and think of what you are doing.
</p>
<p>
"Dickens again?"
</p>
<p>
Why not, since there is no more genial and pertinent philosopher of common life and every-day subjects? To quote, then:-
</p>
<p>
"It was a maxim of Captain Swosser's," said Mrs. Badger, "speaking in his figurative, naval manner, that when you make pitch hot, you cannot make it too hot, and that if you have only to swab a plank, yon should swab it as If Davy Jones were after you. It appears to me that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well ay the nautical profession."
</p>
<p>
"To all professions" observed Mr. Badger. "It was admirably said by Captain Swosser; beautifully said!"
</p>
<p>
But it will sometimes happen that when you have heated your pitch, or swabbed your deck, or made your pudding according to the lights set before you, the result is a failure. This is especially apt to occur in a maiden effort. You have wasted materials and time, and suffered, moreover, acute demoralization-are enwrapped in a wet blanket of discouragement, instead of the seemly robe of complacency. Yet no part of the culinary education is more useful, if turned to proper account, than this very discipline of failure. It is a stepping-stone to excellence-sharp, it is true, but often sure. You have learned how 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> to do it right, which is the next thing to success. It is pretty certain that yon will avoid, in your second essay, the rock upon which you have split this time. And, after all, there are few failure
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=21"/>
which are utter and irremediable. Scorched soups and custards, sour bread, biscuit yellow with soda, and cake heavy as lead, come under the head of "hopeless," They are absolutely unfit to be set before civilized beings and educated stomachs. Should such mishaps occur, lock the memory of the attempt in your own bosom, and do not vex or amuse John and your guests with the narration still less with visible proof of the calamity. Many a partial failure would pass unobserved but for the clouded brow and earnest apologies of the hostess. Do not apologize except at the last gasp! If there is but one chance in ten that a single person present may not discover the deficiency which has changed all food on the table to dust and gravel-stones to you, trust to the one chance, and carry off the matter bravely. You will be astonished to find, if you keep your wits about you how often even your husband will remain in blissful ignorance that aught has gone wrong, if you do not tell him. You know so well what should have been the product of your labor that you exaggerate the justice of others' perceptions. Console yourself, furthermore, with the reflection that yours is not the first failure upon record, nor the million-and-first, and that there will be as many tomorrows as there have been yesterdays,
</p>
<p>
Don't add to a trifling 
<emph rend="italic">contretemps</emph> the real discomfort of a discontented or fretful wife. Say blithely, if John note your misfortune- "I hope to do better another time," and do not be satisfied until you have redeemed your pledge. Experience and your quick wit will soon teach you how to avert impending evils of this nature, how to snatch your preparations from imminent destruction, and, by ingenious correctives or concealments, to make them presentable. These you will soon learn for yourself if you keep before you the truism I have already written, to wit, that few failures are beyond repair.

Never try experiments for the benefit of invited guests nor, when John is at home, risk the success of your meal upon a new dish. Have something which you know he can eat, and introduce experiments as by-play. But do not bo too shy of innovations in the shape of untried dishes. Variety is not only pleasant, but healthful. The least pampered palate will weary of stereotyped bills of fare. It is an idea which should have been exploded long ago, that plain roast, boiled, and fried, on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, cod-fish on Friday, with pork-and-beans every Saturday, are means of grace, because economical. And with this should have vanished the prejudice against warmed-over meals-or 
<emph rend="italic">r&#233;chauff&#233;s,</emph> as our French friends term them. I have tried, in the following pages, to set forth the attractions of these, their claims to your attention as being savory, economical, nourishing, and often elegant, In preparing these acceptably, everything depends upon your own taste and skill. Season with judgment, cook just enough and not a minute too long, and dish nicely. The recommendation of the eye to the palate is a point no cook can afford to disregard. If you can offer an unexpected visitor nothing better than bread-and-butter and cold ham, he will enjoy the luncheon twice as much if the bread be sliced thinly and evenly, spread smoothly, each slice folded in the middle upon the buttered surface, and piled symmetrically ; if the ham be also cut thin, scarcely thicker than a wafer, and garnished with parsley, cresses, or curled lettuce. Set on mustard and pickles ; let the table-cloth and napkin be white and glossy; the glass clear, and plate Binning clean; and add to these accessories to comforts bright welcome, and, my word for it, you need fear no dis-satisfaction on his part, however epicurean may be his tastes. Should your cupboard be bare of aught more substantial than crackers and cheese, do not yield to dismay
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=23"/>
Split the crackers (if splittable), toast the inside lightly, and butter while hot. Grate your cheese into a powdery mound, garnishing the edges of the plate. If you have no beverage except water to set before him, let this be cool, and pour it out for him yourself, into an irreproachable glass. A dirty table-cloth, a smeared goblet, or a sticky plate, will spoil the most luxurious feast. A table well set is half-spread.
</p>
<p>
I have not said one-tenth of that which is pressing upon my heart and mind, yet I fear you may think me trite and tedious. One suggestion more, and we will proceed to the details of business.
</p>
<p>
I believe that, so far as care can avail in securing such a result, my receipts are accurate. But in the matter of seasoning and other minor details, consult your judgment and John's taste. Take this liberty with whatever receipt you think you can improve. If I chance to find in your work-basket, or upon the kitchen dresser, a well-thumbed copy of my beloved "Common Sense," with copious annotations in the margin, I shall, so far from feeling wounded, be flattered in having so diligent a student, and, with your permission, shall engraft the most happy suggestions upon the second edition.

<p>
In looking over this book the reader will notice certain receipts marked thus-. I do not claim for these greater merit than should of right be accorded to many others. I merely wish to call the attention of the novice to them as certainly safe, and for the most part simple. Every one thus marked has been tried by myself; most of them are in frequent, some in daily use, in my own family.
</p>
<p>
My reason for thus singling out comparatively a small number of receipts from the rest, is the recollection of my own perplexities--the loss of time and patience to which I have been subjected in the examination of a new cookery-book, with an eye to immediate use of the directions laid down for various dishes. I have often and vainly wished for a finger-board to guide me in my search for those which were easy and sure, and which would result satisfactorily. This sort of directory I have endeavored to supply, taking care, however, to inform the reader in advance that, so far as I know, there is not an unsafe receipt in the whole work.
</p>
<p>
Of course it was not necessary or expedient to append the above sign to plain "roast and boiled," which are in common use every-where.

<p>
THE base of your soup should always be uncooked meat. To this may be added, if you like, cracked bones of cooked game, or of underdone beef or mutton; but for flavor and nourishment, depend upon the juices of the meat which was put in raw. Gut this into small pieces, and beat the bone until it is fractured at every inch of its length. Put them on in cold water, without salt, and heat very slowly. Do not boil fast at any stage of the operation. Keep the pot covered, and do not add the salt until the meat is thoroughly done, as it has a tendency to harden the fibres, and restrain the flow of the juices. Strain-always through a cullender, after which clear soups should be filtered through a hair-sieve or coarse bobbinet lace. The bag should not be squeezed.
</p>
<p>
It is slovenly to leave rags of meat, husks of vegetables and bits of bone in the tureen. Do not uncover until you are ready to ladle out the soup. Do this neatly and quickly, having your soup-plates heated beforehand.
</p>
<p>
Most soups are better the second day than the first, unless they are warmed over too quickly or left too long upon the fire after they are hot. In the one case they are apt to scorch; in the other they become insipid.

<p>
6 qts. of <ingredient>water.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
The <ingredient>stock</ingredient> must be prepared the day before the soup is needed. Put the <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>bones</ingredient> and all, with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in a close vessel, and set it where it will heat gradually. Let it boil very slowly for six hours at least, only uncovering the pot once in a great while to see if there ia danger of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> sinking too rapidly. Should this be the case, replenish with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> talcing care not to put in too much. During the seventh hour, take off the soup and set it away, still closely covered, until next morning. About an hour before dinner, take out the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> which you can use for mince-<ingredient>meat,</ingredient> if you wish; remove the cake of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the surface of the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> set the soup over the fire, and throw in a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to bring up the scum. When this has been skimmed carefully off, put in your vegetables. These should be:-
</p>
<p>
<list align="center"><item>2 <ingredient>carrots.</ingredient></item><item>3 <ingredient>turnips.</ingredient></item><item>Half a head of white <ingredient>cabbage.</ingredient></item><item>1 pt. green <ingredient>corn</ingredient> -or dried Shaker <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> soaked over night.</item><item>1 <ingredient>head celery.</ingredient></item><item>1 qt. <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient></item></list>
<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=34"/>
These should be prepared for the soup by slicing them very small, and stewing them in barely enough <ingredient>water</ingredient> to cover them, until they break to pieces. Cook the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> by itself in two waters-throwing the first away. The only exception to the general dissolution, is in the case of a single <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> which should likewise be cooked alone and whole, until thoroughly done? and set aside to cool, when the rest of the vegetables, with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which they were boiled, are added to the soup. Return the pot to the fire with the vegetables and <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> and boil slowly for half an hour from the time ebullition actually begins. Strain without pressing, only shaking and lightly stirring the contents of the cullender. The vegetables having been added with all their <ingredient>juices</ingredient> already cooked, much boiling and squeezing are not needed, and only make the soup cloudy. Cut the reserved <ingredient>carrot</ingredient> into dice and drop into the clear liquor after it is in the tureen,-also, if you like, a handful of <ingredient>vermicelli,</ingredient> or <ingredient>macaroni</ingredient> which has been boiled tender in clear <ingredient>water.</ingredient>

Some use only <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>white pepper.</ingredient> Others like with this a few blades of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> and boil in the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> a handful of <ingredient>sweet herbs.</ingredient> And others fancy that, in addition to these, a glass of brown <ingredient>sherry</ingredient> imparts a flavor that renders it peculiarly acceptable to most palates.

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading">BOILED <ingredient>CODFISH.</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">(Fresh)</emph></purpose> Lay the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> slightly salted, for half an hour before it is time to cook it. Wipe it dry and put it into the <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-kettle with <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover it, in which has been dissolved a little <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Let it boil quite briskly A piece of <ingredient>cod</ingredient> weighing three pounds will be cooked in half an hour from the time the <ingredient>water</ingredient> fairly boils, if put in without a cloth. But by far the better plan is, when the <ingredient>cod</ingredient> hag been wiped free of the <ingredient>salt and water,</ingredient> to wrap it in a clean linen cloth kept for such purposes. The cloth should be dredged with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> to prevent sticking. Sew up the edges in such a manner as to envelop the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> entirely, yet have but one thickness of the cloth over any part. The wrapping should be fitted neatly to the shape of the piece to be cooked. <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> cooked thus will require twice as long to boil as when put into the <ingredient>water</ingredient> without such protection; but the flavor is better preserved, and when unwrapped, it will not present the sodden appearance and crumbling grain that disfigure most boiled <ingredient>fish.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Have ready a <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> prepared thus:-
</p>
<p>
To one gill <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> add as much <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and when it is scalding-hot, stir in-leaving the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-pan on the fire-two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> a little at a time, that it may melt without oiling, a tablespoonful of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> previously wet with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and, as this thickens, two beaten <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> and when, after one good boil, you withdraw it from the fire, add a dozen <ingredient>capers,</ingredient> or pickled <ingredient>nasturtium seeds,</ingredient> or, if you prefer, a spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in which <ingredient>celery-seeds</ingredient> have been steeped. Put the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> into a hot dish, and pour the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> over it. Some serve in a <ingredient>butter</ingredient>-boat ; but I fancy that the boiling <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> applied to the steaming <ingredient>fish</ingredient> imparts a richness it cannot gain later. Garnish
<pb n="51" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=49"/>
with sprigs of parley and circles of <ingredient>hard-boiled eggs,</ingredient> laid around the edge of the dish.

<p>
This is a useful receipt for country housekeepers who can seldom procure fresh <ingredient>cod.</ingredient> <ingredient>Salt mackerel,</ingredient> prepared in the same way, will well repay the care and time required, so superior is it to the Friday's dish of <ingredient>salt fish,</ingredient> as usually served.
</p>
<p>
Should the cold <ingredient>fish</ingredient> left over he used for <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-balls-as it should be-it will be found that the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> which has soaked into it while hot has greatly improved it.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>CODFISH</ingredient> BALLS.</purpose> Prepare the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> precisely as for boiling whole. Cut in pieces when it has been duly washed and soaked, and boil twenty minutes. Turn off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and cover with fresh

Plainer <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-cakes may be made of the <ingredient>cod</ingredient> and <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>  alone, moulded round like <ingredient>biscuit.</ingredient> In any shape the dish is popular.
</p>
<p>
It gives me great pleasure to recommend the desiccated <ingredient>cod-fish</ingredient> put up in boxes by the Boston and Philadelphia <ingredient>Salt Fish</ingredient> Company. The <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is already cooked and shred, and the housekeeper is thus saved the only disagreeable part of the process of malting this delightful breakfast relish-the boiling and the unsavory odor arising therefrom, as well as the care of soaking and picking out the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> The balls prepared from the desiccated <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are every whit equal in flavor to those made of the home-cooked, and can be ready at half-an-hour's notice. The cost is not more-perhaps less, than when one buys the <ingredient>cod</ingredient> in bulk? <ingredient>bones</ingredient> and all.

Be sure that the contents of the kettle are boiling when transferred to the cans that they are not allowed time to cool in the transit, that the elastic on the can is properly adjusted, and the top screwed down tightly, and success is certain. I would call the attention of those who are fond of the potted spiced <ingredient>salmon,</ingredient> sold at a high price in gro cery-stores, to this receipt for making the same luxury at home.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">PICKLED <ingredient>SALMON.</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">(<ingredient>Salt.</ingredient>)</emph></purpose> At certain seasons of the year fresh <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> cannot be procured, even by the dwellers in cities, while those who live in the country sometimes do not see it from one year's end to the other. But dried <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> can always be had in any tolerably well-kept grocery, and a very nice relish prepared from it.
</p>
<p>
Wash the <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> in two or three waters, rubbing it lightly with a coarse cloth to remove the <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-crystals. Then soak over night in tepid <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Exchange this in the morning for ice-cold and let the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> lie in the latter for three hours. Take it out, wipe dry, and cut in strips as directed in the foregoing receipt. Drop these, when all are ready, in a saucepan of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> placed alongside of a kettle of <ingredient>pickle</ingredient> prepared as for fresh <ingredient>salmon.</ingredient> Beside these have your air-tight jars, covers laid in readiness, and when the <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> has boiled five minutes--fairly boiled, not simmered--<ingredient>fish</ingredient> out the pieces with your wire spoon, pack rapidly into your can; fill up with the boiling <ingredient>pickle</ingredient> from the other kettle, and seal instantly. In two days, the pickled <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> will be fit for use, and is scarcely distinguishable from that made of fresh <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> It has the advantage of being always procurable, and of comparative cheapness, and in the country is a valuable stand-by in case of unexpected supper company.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">To BOIL A <ingredient>LOBSTER.</ingredient></purpose> Choose a lively one -- not too large, lest he should be tough. Put a handful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> into a pot of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and having tied the claws together, if your <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-merchant has not already skewered them, plunge him into the prepared bath. He will be restive under this vigorous hydropathic treatment; but allay your tortured sympathies by the reflection that he is a cold-blooded animal, destitute of imagination, and that pain, according to some philosophers, exists only in the imagination. However this may bo, his suffering will be short-lived. Boil from half an hour to an hour, as his size demands. When done, draw out the scarlet innocent, and lay him face downward, in a sieve to dry When cold split open the body and tail, and crack the claws to <ingredient>extract</ingredient> the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> throwing away the "lady-fingers" and the <ingredient>head.</ingredient> <ingredient>Lobsters</ingredient> are seldom served without dressing, up on private tables, as few persons care to take the trouble of preparing their own salad after taking their seats at the board.

If you doubt this, pour a little of the liquor from the pickled <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> put up by your obliging <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-dealer into a bell-metal kettle. I tried it once, and the result was a liquid that matched the clear green of Niagara in hue. I cannot compare it justly with anything else.

Poultry should never be eaten in less than six or eight hours after it is killed ; but it should be picked and drawn as soon as possible. There is no direr disgrace to our Northern markets than the practice of sending whole dead fowls to market. I have bought such from responsible poultry-dealers, and found them uneatable, from having remained undrawn until the flavor of the craw and intestines had impregnated the whole body. Those who are conver-uaoit with the habit of careful country housewives, of keeping
<pb n="83" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=81"/>
up a fowl without food for a day and night before kill ing and dressing for their own eating, cannot but regard with disgust the surcharged crops and puffy sides of those sold 
<emph rend="italic">by weight</emph> in the shambles. If you want to know what you really pay for poultry bought in these circumstances, weigh the offal extracted from the <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> by your cook, and deduct from the market weight, "But don't you know it actually poisons a <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> to lie so long undressed?" once exclaimed a Southern lady to me. "In 
<emph rend="italic">our</emph> markets they are offered for sale ready picked and drawn, with the <ingredient>giblets</ingredient>- also cleaned-tucked under their <ingredient>wings.</ingredient>"
</p>
<p>
I know nothing about the poisonous nature of the entrails and crops. I do assert that the custom is unclean and unjust. And this I do without the remotest hope of arousing my fellow-housekeepers to remonstrance against established usage. Only it relieves my mind somewhat to grumble at what I cannot help. The best remedy I can propose for the grievance is to buy live <ingredient>fowls,</ingredient> and, before sending them home, ask your butcher to decapitate them.; the probabilities being greatly in favor of the supposition that your cook is too "tinder-hearted" to attempt the job.
</p>
<p>
One word as to the manner of roasting <ingredient>meats</ingredient> and <ingredient>fowls.</ingredient> In this day of ranges and cooking-stoves, I think I am speaking within bounds when I assume that not one housekeeper in fifty uses a spit, or even a tin kitchen, for such purposes. It is in vain that the writers of receipt-books inform us with refreshing 
<emph rend="italic">na&#239;vet&#233;</emph> that all our <ingredient>meats</ingredient> are baked, not roasted, and expatiate upon the superior flavor of those prepared upon the English spits and in old-fashioned kitchens, where enormous wood-fires blazed from morning until night. I shall not soon forget my perplexity when, an inexperienced housekeeper and a firm believer in all "that was writ" by older and wiser people, I stood before my <ingredient>neat</ingredient> Mott's "Defiance," a fine <ingredient>sirloin of beef</ingredient>
<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=82"/>
ready to be cooked on the table behind me, and read from my Instruction-book that my "fire should extend at least eight inches beyond the roaster on either side!" I am not denying the virtues of spits and tin kitchens-only regret-ting that they are not within the reach of every one. In view of this fact, let me remark, for the benefit of the unfortunate many, that, in the opinion of excellent judges, the practice of roasting <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in close ovens has advantages. Of these I need mention but two, to wit, the preservation of the flavor of the article roasted, and the prevention of its escape to the upper regions of the dwelling.
</p>
<p>
The directions hereafter given touching roasting will apply either to turnspit, "kitchens," or ovens.

Fill the body with this <ingredient>water,</ingredient> shake well, empty it out, and rinse with <ingredient>fair water.</ingredient> Then prepare a dressing of <ingredient>bread-crumbs,</ingredient> mixed with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet marjoram,</ingredient> and wet with <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> You may, if you like, add the beaten <ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> A little chopped <ingredient>sausage</ingredient> is esteemed an improvement when well incorporated with the other ingredients.

the body of the <ingredient>turkey,</ingredient> and sew it up with strong thread, This and the <ingredient>neck</ingredient>-string are to be removed when the <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> is dished. In roasting, if your fire is brisk, allow about ten minutes to a pound; but it will depend very much upon the <ingredient>turkey's</ingredient> age whether this rule holds good.

If yon roast in an oven, and lay the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> in the pan, pub in with it a teacup of <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient> Many roast always upon a grating placed on the top of the pan. In that case the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> steams the underpart of the <ingredient>fowl,</ingredient> and prevents the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> from drying too fasts or cracking. Roast to a fine brown, and if it threaten to darken too rapidly, lay a sheet of <ingredient>white paper</ingredient> over it until the lower part is also done.

<p>
Stew the chopped <ingredient>giblets</ingredient> in just enough <ingredient>water</ingredient> to cover them, and when the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is lifted from the pan, add these, with ihe <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which they were boiled, to the <ingredient>drippings;</ingredient> thicken with a spoonful of <ingredient>browned flour,</ingredient> web with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to prevent lumping, boil up once, and pour into the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient>-boat.

This pudding, which the cook who introduced it into my family persisted in calling "<emph rend="italic">Auction</emph> pudding," is very palatable and popular, and not so rich as would be thought from the manner of baking. It should be a yellow-brown when done.

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>BEEF-STEAK.</ingredient></purpose> It is not customary to fry <ingredient>beef-steaks</ingredient> for people who know what really good cookery is. To speak move plainly, a <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">killed</emph> by heat and swimming in <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> is a culinary solecism, both vulgar and indigestible.
</p>
<p>
Cut the <ingredient>steak</ingredient> thick, at least three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and if you cannot get tender <ingredient>meat</ingredient> for this purpose, it is best to substitute some other dish for it. But since tender <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is not always to be had, if the piece you have purchased is doubtful, lay it on a clean cloth, take a blunt heavy carving-knife, if you have not a <ingredient>steak</ingredient> mallet,
<pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=98"/>
and hack 
<emph rend="italic">closely</emph> from one end to the other; then turn and repeat the process upon the other side. The knife should be so dull you cannot cut with it, and the strokes not the sixtieth part of an inch apart. Wipe, but not wash, and lay on a buttered gridiron over a clear fire, turning very often as it begins to drip. Do not season until it is done, which will be in about twelve minutes, if the fire is good and the cook attentive. Rub your hot chafing-dish with a split raw <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> lay in the <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> on both sides, and put a liberal lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> upon the upper. Then put on a hot cover, and let it stand five minutes to draw the <ingredient>juices</ingredient> to the surface before it is eaten. If you have neither chafing-dish nor cover, lay the <ingredient>steak</ingredient> between two hot platters for the same time, sending to table without uncovering. A gridiron fitting 
<emph rend="italic">under</emph> the grate is better than any other. If a gridiron is not at hand, rub a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> upon the bottom of a hot, clean frying-pan, put in the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> set over a bright fire, and turn frequently. This will not be equal to <ingredient>steak</ingredient> cooked upon a gridiron, but it is infinitely preferable to the same fried.
</p>
<p>
I shall never forget the wondering distrust with which my first cook, a sable "professional," watched me when I undertook to show her how to prepare a <ingredient>steak</ingredient> for the third breakfast over which I presided as mistress of ceremonies. And when, at the end of twelve minutes, I removed the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> "rare and hot," to the heated dish in readiness, her sniff of lofty contempt was eloquent as indescribable.
</p>
<p>
"Call dat 
<emph rend="italic">cooked!</emph> Folks 'bout here would 'a had dat <ingredient>steak</ingredient> on by day-break!"
</p>
<p>
A remark that has been recalled to my mind hundreds of times since at the tables of so-called capital housewives.
</p>
<p>
The best-nay, the only pieces for <ingredient>steak</ingredient> are those known as porter-house and <ingredient>sirloin.</ingredient> The former is the more highly esteemed by gourmands; but a really tender <ingredient>sirloin</ingredient> is more

Cover tightly and stew very slowly for six hours; then set in the oven with the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> about it, and brown half an hour, basting frequently.
</p>
<p>
If you roast the round, do not remove the cover, except to baste (and this should be done often), until fifteen minutes before you draw it from the oven. Set away with the muslin band still about it, and pour the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> over the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
When cold, lift from the <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> - which, by the way, will be excellent <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> for yoar soup-<ingredient>stock,</ingredient> - cut the stitches in the muslin girdle, and remove carefully and send the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> to table, cold, garnished with <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> and

<hd align="center" size="larger">PORK.</hd>
<p>
At the South, where, in spite of the warm climate, the consumption of pork is double that of the North, the full-grown hog is seldom represented by any of his parts at the table, fresh or pickled, unless it be during killing-time; then fresh spare-ribs, chine, and steak, with other succu-lent bits, are welcome upon the choicest bills of fare. The rest of the animal-ham, shoulders, and middlings-is consigned to the packing-barrel, and ultimately to the smoke-house. But, in cool weather, "shoat"-<emph rend="italic">i. e.</emph>, pig under six months of age-is abundantly displayed in market, and highly esteemed by all classes. The meat is fine and sweet, and, unless too fat, nearly as delicate as that of chicken-a very different looking and tasting dish from the gross, oleaginous joints and "chunks" offered for sale in many other regions as "nice young pork." Those of my readers who can command "shoat" are to be heartily congratu-lated. Those whose butchers dispense only portions of the mature porker will do well, in my opinion, if they rarely admit him to their families before he has been salted, and been thereby purged of many unwholesome properties. Few stomachs, save those of out-door laborers, can digest the fresh meat of a two or three, or even one year old hog. This is the truthful, but, to unaccustomed ears, offensive name for him at the South and West, where his qualities and habits are best known.
</p>
<p>
The parts of a properly dissected hog are the hams, shoulders, griskin or chine, the loin, middlings, spare-ribs, head, feet, liver, and haslet. The choice portions are hams, shoulders, and, for roasting, the loin. All hogs should be kept up and well fed for three weeks, at least, before they are killed; their styes be frequently cleaned, and furnished with abundance of water, renewed every day. Sir Grunter
<pb n="129" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=127"/>
would be a more cleanly creature if he were allowed more extensive water privileges. If it were possible--and in the country this may sometimes be done--to build his pen on the bank of a running stream, he would speedily redeem his character from the stain cast upon it by the popular verdict, and the superior quality of the meat repay the thoughtful kindness of his owner. It is a disgrace to humanity, hardly second to the barbarities of swill-milk manufactories, this compulsory filth of any domestic animal, Those who, like myself, have been loathing witnesses of the pig-pens upon the premises of well-to-do farmers--the receptacles of the vilest slops and offal, never cleaned except during the yearly removal of manure from barnyard to field--cannot marvel at the growing prejudice against pork in all its varieties that pervades our best classes. We feed the hog with the offscourings (this is literal) of house, garden, and table; bed him in mire, and swell him with acetous fermentation, not to say active de-composition, and then abuse him for being what we have made him. I am persuaded--and wiser people than I declare--that hog-scrofula and cholera, and the rest of the train of fleshly ills that are the terror of pork-raisers, have, one and all, then root in this unseemly inhumanity. Eschew fresh pork we may, but we cannot dispense with hams, shoulders, and, most valuable of all to the cook, lard and pickled pork. Real sausage, porcine and home-made, is still sweet and pleasant to the unpampered palate; and of roast pig, the gentlest and most genial of English essayists did not disdain to become the eulogist. In memory of his usefulness, in belief of the healthfulness which should be his birthright, and the safeguard of his consumers, let us treat Bristle well--I do not say philosophically, but sensibly and kindly.
</p>
<p>
A pig should not be allowed to eat anything for twenty-
<pb n="130" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=128"/>
four hours before he is killed. After he is butchered, great care should be exercised to keep the pork from tainting; it spoils more readily, when fresh, than any other meat. Cook all kinds of pork thoroughly. When underdone it is not only unpalatable, but exceedingly unwholesome.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>ROAST PIG.</ingredient></purpose> A month-<ingredient>old pig,</ingredient> if it be well-grown and plump, is best for this purpose. It is hardly possible that any lady-housekeeper will ever be called upon to do the butcher's work upon the bodies of full-grown <ingredient>hogs,</ingredient> or even "shoat"-a task that requires the use of hatchet or cleaver. It is well that she should know how to clean and dress the baby <ingredient>pig,</ingredient> which is not larger than a Thanksgiving <ingredient>turkey.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
As soon as it is really cold, make ready a large boiler of scalding <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Lay the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for fifteen minutes; then, holding it by the hind <ingredient>leg,</ingredient> plunge it into the <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and shake it about violently until you can pull the hair off by the handful. Take it out, wipe it dry, and with a crash cloth or whisk broom rub the hair off, brushing from the tail to the <ingredient>head,</ingredient> until the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> is perfectly clean. Cut it open, take out the entrails, and wash very thoroughly with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> then with <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> to remove any unpleasant odor; next with <ingredient>salt and water.</ingredient> Rinse with <ingredient>fair water</ingredient> and wipe inside. Then wrap in a wet cloth, and keep this saturated with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> until you are ready to stuff it. If these directions be followed implicitly, the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> will be fair and <ingredient>white,</ingredient> as if intrusted to a professional butcher.
</p>
<p>
For <ingredient>stuffing,</ingredient> take a cupful of <ingredient>bread-crumbs,</ingredient> half a chopped <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> two teaspoonfuls powdered <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> three tablespoonfuls melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> a saltspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> half a grated <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> two well-beaten <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Mix all these ingredients, except the <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> together, incorporating them well; moisten with half a cup of warm
<pb n="133" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=131"/>
<ingredient>water</ingredient> (or <ingredient>milk</ingredient>), beat in the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and stuff the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> into his natural size and shape. Sew him up, and bend his fore-<ingredient>feet</ingredient> backward, his hind-<ingredient>feet</ingredient> forward, under and close to the body, and skewering them into the proper position. Dry it well, and dredge with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Put it to roast with a little <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> slightly salted, in the dripping-pan. Baste with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> three times, as the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> gradually warms, afterward with the dripping. When it begins to smoke or steam, rub it over, every five minutes or so, with a cloth dipped in melted <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Do not omit this precaution if you would have the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> tender and soft after it begins to brown. A month-<ingredient>old pig</ingredient> will require about an hour and three quarters or two hours-sometimes longer-to roast, if the fire be brisk and steady.
</p>
<p>
Should you or your guests dislike <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> prepare your <ingredient>stuffing</ingredient> without it. The following is a good receipt for rich and <ingredient>savory force-meat</ingredient> for a <ingredient>pig</ingredient>:-
</p>
<p>
One cup of <ingredient>bread-crumbs,</ingredient> an ounce of <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> a bunch of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> minced fine, teaspoonful of powdered <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> half a glass <ingredient>Madeira</ingredient> or <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> <ingredient>juice of a lemon,</ingredient> two tablespoonfuls melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> a cup of <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-liquor, and two well-beaten <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> For a Christinas <ingredient>pig,</ingredient> it is worth one's while to take the trouble to prepare this <ingredient>stuffing.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
If your <ingredient>pig</ingredient> is large, you can cut off his <ingredient>head</ingredient> and split him down the back before sending to table. Do this with a sharp knife, and lay the backs together. But it is a pity! I have before me now the vision of a <ingredient>pig</ingredient> I once saw served whole on the table of a friend, that forbids me ever to mutilate the innocent before the guests have a chance to feast their eyes upon the goodly picture. He was done to a turn-a rich, even brown, without a seam or crack from <ingredient>head</ingredient> to tail, and he knelt in a bed of deep-<ingredient>green parsley,</ingredient> alternately with bunches of whitish-green
<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=132"/>
<ingredient>celery</ingredient> tops (the inner and tender leaves); a garland of the same was about his <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and in his mouth was a tuft of <ingredient>white cauliflower,</ingredient> surrounded by a setting of curled <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient> Very simple, you see; but I never beheld a more ornamental roast.
</p>
<p>
Skim your <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> well; add a little <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> thicken with brown <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> boil up once, strain, and, when you have added half a glass of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> and half the <ingredient>juice of a lemon,</ingredient> serve in a tureen.
</p>
<p>
In carving the <ingredient>pig,</ingredient> cut off the <ingredient>head</ingredient> first; then split down the back, take off <ingredient>hams</ingredient> and shoulders, and separate the <ingredient>ribs.</ingredient> Serve some of the dressing to each person.
</p>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>LARD.</ingredient></purpose> Every housekeeper knows how unfit for really nice cooking is the pressed <ingredient>lard</ingredient> sold in stores as the " best and cheapest." It is close and tough, melts slowly, and is some-times diversified by fibrous lumps. And ever when <ingredient>lard</ingredient>
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=141"/>
has been "tried out " by the usual process, it is often mixed with so much <ingredient>water</ingredient> as to remind us unpleasantly that it is bought by weight.
</p>
<p>
The best way of preparing the " leaf <ingredient>lard,</ingredient>" as it is called, is to <ingredient>skin</ingredient> it carefully, wash, and lot it drain; then put it, out into bits, into a large, clean tin kettle or bucket, and set this in a pot of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> Stir from time to time until it is molted 5 throw in a very little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> to make the sediment settle; and when it is hot--(it should not boil fast at any time, but simmer gently until clear)--strain through a coarse cloth into jars. Do not squeeze the cloth so long as the clear <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will run through, and when you do, press the refuse into a different vessel, to be used for commoner purposes than the other.
</p>
<p>
Most of the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> in general use is, however, made from the fatty portions of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> lying next the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the <ingredient>hog,</ingredient> and are left for this purpose by the butcher. Scrape from the <ingredient>rind,</ingredient> and cut all into dice. Fill a large pot, putting in a teacupful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to prevent scorching, and melt very slowly, stirring every few minutes. Simmer until there remains nothing of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> but fibrous bits. Remove these carefully with a perforated skimmer; throw in a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> to settle the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and when it is clear, strain through a fine cullender, a sieve, or a coarse cloth. Dip the latter in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> should it become clogged by the cooling <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> Observe the directions about squeezing the strainer. If your family is small, <ingredient>bear</ingredient> in mind that <ingredient>lard</ingredient> keeps longer in small than large vessels. Set away the jats, closely covered, in a cool, dry cellar or store-room.
</p>
<p>
In trying out <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> the chief danger is of burning. Simmer gently over a steady fire, and give it your whole atten-tion until it is done. A moment's neglect will ruin all, Stir very often--almost constantly at the lust--and from the bottom, until the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is thrown in to sottle it, when
<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=142"/>
withdraw to a less hot part of the fire. Bladders tied over <ingredient>lard</ingredient> jars are the best protection; next to these, <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> and outside of this, cloths dipped in melted <ingredient>grease.</ingredient>

<p>
LAYING to your conduct the line and plummet of the Golden Rule, never pay a visit (I use the word in contra-distinction to "call") without notifying your hostess-elect of your intention thus to favor her.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps once in ten thousand times, your friend-be film mother, sister, or intimate acquaintance-may be en-raptured at your unexpected appearance, travelling-satchel in hand, at her door, to pass a day, a night, or a month; or may be pleasantly surprised when you take the baby, and run in to tea in a social way. But the chances are so greatly in favor of the probability that you will upset her house-hold arrangements, abrade her temper, or put her to undue trouble or embarrassment, by this evidence of your wish to have her feel quite easy with you, to treat you as one of the family, that it is hardly worth your while to risk so much in order to gain so little.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Partington has said more silly things than any other woman of her age in this country; but she spoke wisely in declaring her preference for those surprise-parties "when people sent word they were coming." Do not be ashamed to say to your nearest of kin, or the confidante of your school-days-"Always let me know when to look for you, that I may so order my time and engagements as to secure the greatest possible pleasure from your visit." If you are the woman I take you to be-methodical indus-trious, and ruling your household according to just and firm laws of order and punctuality, you need this notice. If you are likewise social and hospitable, your rules are made with reference to possible and desirable interruptions of this nature. It only requires a little closer packing of certain duties, an easy exchange of times and seasons, and
<pb n="155" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=153"/>
leisure is obtained for the right enjoyment of your friend's society. The additional place is set at table; your spare bed, which yesterday was tossed into a heap that both mat tresses might be aired, and covered lightly with a thin spread, is made up with fresh sheets that have not gath-ered damp and must from lying packed beneath blankets and coverlets for may be a month, for fear somebody might happen in to pass the night, and catch you with the bed in disorder. Towels and water are ready; the room is bright and dustless; the dainty dish so far prepared for dinner or tea as to be like Mrs. Bagnet's greens, "off your mind;" John knows whom he is to see at his home-coming; the children are clean, and on the 
<emph rend="italic">qui vive</emph> -- children's instincts are always hospitable. The guest's welcome is half given in the air of the house and the family group before you have time to utter a word. It may Lave appeared to her a useless formality to despatch the note or telegram you insisted upon. She knows you love her, and she would be wounded by the thought that she could ever "come amiss" to your home. Perhaps, as she lays aside her travelling-dress, she smiles at your "ceremonious, old-maidish ways," and marvels that so good a manager should deem such forms necessary with an old friend.
</p>
<p>
If she had driven to your house at nightfall, to discover that you had gone with husband and children to pass several days with John's mother, in a town fifty miles away, and that the servants were out "a pleasuring" in the mistress' absence; if she had found you at home, nursing three children through the measles, she having brought her youngest with her; if you were yourself the invalid, bound hand and foot to a Procrustean couch, and utterly unable even to see her-John, meanwhile, being incapacitated from playing the part of agreeable host by worry and anxiety; if, on the day before her arrival, your chambermaid had
<pb n="156" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=154"/>
gone off in a "tiff" leaving you to do her work and to nurse your cook, sick In the third story; if earlier comers than herself had filled every spare mattress in the house;-if any one of these, or a dozen other ills to which housekeepers are heirs, had impressed upon her the idea that her visit was inopportune, she might think better of your "punctilio."
</p>
<p>
But since unlooked--for visitors will occasionally drop in upon the best regulated families, make it your study to receive them gracefully and cordially. If they care enough for you to turn aside from their regular route to tarry a day, or night, or week with you, it would be churlish not to show appreciation of the favor in which you are held. Make them welcome to the best you can offer at so short a notice, and let no preoccupied air or troubled smile bear token to your perturbation--if you are perturbed. If you respect yourself and your husband, the appointments of your table will never put you to the blush. John, who buys the silver, glass, china, and napery, is entitled to the everyday use of the best. You may have--I hope this is so--a holiday set of each, put away beyond the reach of hourly accidents; but if this is fit for the use of a lord, do not make John eat three hundred and sixty days in the year from such ware as would suit a ditcher's cottage. If your children never see bright silver unless when "there is company," you cannot wonder, although you will be mortified, at their making looking-glasses of the bowls of the spoons, and handling the forks awkwardly. Early impress upon them that what is nice enough for Papa, is nice enough for the President, I have noticed that where there is a wide difference between family and company table furniture, there usually exists a corresponding disparity between everyday and company manners.
</p>
<p>
Especially, let your welcome be ready and hearty when
<pb n="157" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=155"/>
your husband brings home an unexpected guest. Take care he understands clearly that this is his prerogative; that the rules by which you would govern the visits of your own sex are not applicable to his. Men rarely set seasons for their visits. They snatch an hour or two with an old chum or new friend out of the hurry of business-life, as one stoops to pluck a stray violet from a dusty roadside. John must take his chances when he can get. them. If he can walk home, arm in arm, with the school-fellow he has not seen before in ten years, not only fear-lessly, but gladly, anticipatory of your pleasure at the sight of his; if, when the stranger is presented to you, you receive him as your friend because he is your husband's, and seat him to a family dinner, plain, but nicely served, and eaten in cheerfulness of heart; if the children are well-behaved, and your attire that of a lady who has not lost the desire to look her best in her husband's eyes--you have added to the links of steel that knit your husband's heart to you; increased his affectionate admiration for the best little woman in the world. Many a man has been driven to entertain his friends at hotels and club-rooms, because he dared not take them home without permission from the presiding officer of his household. The majority of healthy men have good appetites, and are not disposed to he crit-ical of an unpretending bill of fare. The chance guest of this sex is generally an agreeable addition to the family group, instead of 
<emph rend="italic">de trop</emph>--always supposing him to be John's friend.
</p>
<p>
As to party and dinner-giving, your safest rule is to obey the usage of the community in which you live in minor points, letting common sense and your means guide you in essentials. Be chary of undertaking what you can-not carry through successfully. Pretention is the ruin of bore entertainments than ignorance or lack of money. If
<pb n="158" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=156"/>
you know how to give a large evening party (and think it a pleasant and remunerative investment of time and sev eral hundred dollars)--if you understand the machinery of a handsome dinner-party, and can afford these luxuries, go forward bravely to success. But creep before you walk. Study established customs in the best managed houses you visit; take counsel with experienced friends; now and then make modest essays on your own responsibility, and, insensibly, these crumbs of wisdom will form into a comely loaf. There is no surer de-appetizer--to coin a word--to guests than a heated, over-fatigued, anxious hostess, who betrays her inexperience by nervous glances, abstraction in conversation, and, worst of all, by apologies.
</p>
<p>
A few general observations are all I purpose to offer as hints of a foundation upon which to build your plans for "company-giving." Have an abundance of clean plates, silver, knives, &#38;c., laid in order in a convenient place,--such as an ante-room, or dining-room pantry,--those designed for each course, if your entertainment is a dinner, upon a shelf or stand by themselves, and make your wait-ers understand distinctly in advance in what order these are to be brought on.
</p>
<p>
Soup should be sent up accompanied only by bread, and suck sauce as may be fashionable or suitable. Before din-ner is served, however, snatch a moment, if possible, to inspect the table in person, or instruct a trustworthy factotum to see that everything is in place, the water in the goblets, a slice of bread laid upon a folded napkin at each plate, &#38;c. Unless you have trained, professional waiters, this is a wise precaution. If it is a gentleman's dinner, you can see to it for yourself, since you will not be obliged to appear in the parlor until a few minutes before they are summoned to the dining-room. If there are ladies in the company you must not leave them.
</p>
<pb n="159" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=157"/>
<p>
To return, then, to our soup: It is not customary to offer a second plateful to a guest. When the table is cleared, the fish should come in, with potatoes--no other vegetable, unless it be a salad or stewed tomatoes. Fish is usually attended by pickles and sauces. After a thorough change of plates, &#38;c., came the substantials. Game and other meats arc often set on together, unless the dinner is a very protracted and formal one. Various vegetables are passed to each when he has been helped to meat If wine be used, it is introduced after the fish. Pastry is the first relay of dessert, and puddings may be served from the other end of the table. Next appear creams, jellies, char-lolte-russes, cakes, and the like; then fruit and nuts; lastly coffee, often accompanied with crackers and cheese. Wine, of course, goes around during the dessert--if it flows at all.
</p>
<p>
Evening parties are less troublesome to a housekeeper, because less ceremonious than dinners. If you can afford it, the easiest way to give a large one is to put the whole business into the hands of the profession, by intrusting your order, not only for supper, but waiters and china, to a competent confectioner. But a social standing supper of oysters, chicken-salad, sandwiches, coffee, ice-cream, jellies, and cake, is not a formidable undertaking when you have had a little practice, especially if your own, or John's mother, or the nice, neighborly matron over the way will assist you by her advice and presence.
</p>
<p>
We make this matter of company too hard a business in America; are too apt to treat our friends as the Stras-burgers do their geese; shut them up in overheated quar-ters, and stuff them to repletion. Our rooms would be better for more air, our guests happier had they more liberty, and our hostess would be prettier and more spright-ly were she not overworked before, the arrivals begin, and full of trepidation after they come,--a woman cumbered
<pb n="160" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=158"/>
with many thoughts of serving, while she is supposed to be enjoying the society of her chosen associates. It is so well understood that company is a weariness, that inquiries as to how the principal agent in bringing about an assembly ha. " borne it," have passed into a custom. The tender sympathies manifested in such queries, the martyr-like air with which they are answered, cannot fail to bring to the satirical mind the Chinaman's comment upon the British officers' dancing on ship-board in warm weather.
</p>
<p>
"Why you no make your servants do SO hard work, and you look at dem?"
</p>
<p>
We pervert the very name and meaning of hospitality when we pinch our families, wear away our patience, and waste away our nervous forces with our husbands' money, in getting up to order expensive entertainments for comparative strangers, whose utmost acknowledgment of our efforts in their behalf will consist in an invitation, a year hence it may be, to a party constructed on the same plan, managed a little better or a little worse than ours. This is not hospitality without grudging, but a vulgar system of barter and gluttony more worthy of Abyssinians than Christian gentlefolk.

I once received a letter from the wife of an Eastern man who had removed to the Great West, in which bitter complaints were made of the scarcity of certain comforts- ice-cream and candy among them-to which she had been accustomed in other days. " My hushand shot a fine deer this morning," she wrote, " but I never could endure

The tame rabbit is rarely if ever eaten. The wild hare of the South--in vulgar parlance, "old hare," although the creature may be but a day old--exactly corresponds with
<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=167"/>

<p>
Hares are unfit for eating in the early spring. There is thus much significance in " Mad as a March hare." The real English hare is a much larger animal than that which is known in this country by this name. To speak correctly, all our " old field hares " are wild rabbits.

The large gray squirrel is seldom eaten at the North, but in great request in Virginia and other Southern States. It is generally barbecued, precisely as are rabbits; broiled, fricasseed, or--most popular of all--made into a Brunswick stew. This is named from Brunswick County, Virginia, and is a famous dish--or was--at the political and social picnics. known as barbecues. I am happy to be able to give a receipt for this stew that is genuine and explicit, and for which I am indebted to a Virginia housekeeper.

The real pheasant is never sold in American markets. The bird known as such at the South is called a partridge at the North, and is, properly speaking, the ruffled grouse. The Northern quail is the English and Southern partridge. The wild fowls brought by the hundred dozen from the Far West to Eastern cities, and generally styled prairie-fowls, are a species of grouse. The mode of cooking all these is substantially the same.

"The dressing of the salad should be saturated with oil, and seasoned with pepper and salt before the vinegar is added. It results from this process that there never can be too much vinegar; for, from the specific gravity of the vinegar compared with oil, what is more than useful will fall to the bottom of the bowl. The salt should not be dissolved in the vinegar, but in the oil, by which means it
<pb n="201" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=199"/>
is more equally distributed throughout the salad."-<emph rend="italic">Chaptal, a French chemist.</emph>

The Spanish proverb says, that "to make a perfect salad, there should be a miser for oil, a spendthrift for vinegar, a wise man for salt, and a madcap to stir the in-gredients up and mix them well together."

All <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> salad should be eaten as soon as possible after the dressing is added, else it becomes unwholesome.

This makes the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>  mealy." Mrs. B., whose reputation as a housekeeper and cook is in every kitchen, interposes:- "I have tried both ways. My experience is that <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>  melt into a sort of starchy gruel when boiled in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> The philosophy of the operation is to heat quickly and thor-oughly, and, the instant they are done, to dry ont every drop of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> And -" with a touch of pardonable pride- "we generally have delightful <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> ." This is true, hut remembering that Mrs. A.'s are like snow hillocks, ready to crumble at a breath, I come home and try the <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> plan. My cook, unlike must of her tribe, is too sensible to suppose that she knows everything, and willingly abets me.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>BACON</ingredient> AND <ingredient>CABBAGE.</ingredient></purpose> This, I need hardly say, is a favorite country dish at the South. The old-fashioned way of preparing it was to boil <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> together, and serve, reeking with <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> in quarters, soaking yet more of the essence from the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or middling about which it lay. In this shape it justly earned a reputation for grossness and indigestibility that banished it, in time, from many tables.
</p>
<p>
Yet it is a <ingredient>savory</ingredient> and not unwholesome article of food in winter, if the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> be boiled in two waters, the second being the &quot;pot-liquor&quot; from the boiling <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> Drain thoroughly in a cullender, pressing out every drop of <ingredient>water</ingredient> that will flow, without breaking the tender leaves; and when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is dished, lay the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> neatly about it, and upon each quarter a slice of <ingredient>hard-boiled egg.</ingredient>

When you eat, season with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>MUSHROOMS.</ingredient></purpose><emph rend="italic">Imprimis.</emph>--Have nothing to do with them until you are an excellent judge between the true and false. That sounds somewhat like the advice of the careful mother to her son, touching the wisdom of never going near the <ingredient>water</ingredient> until he learned how to swim--but the caution can hardly be stated too strongly. Not being ambitious of martyrdom, even in the cause of gastronomical enterprise, especially if the instrument is to be a contemptible, rank-smelling fungus, I never eat or cook <ingredient>mushrooms;</ingredient> but I learned, years ago, in hillside rambles, how to distinguish the real from the spurious article. Shun low, damp, shady spots in your quest. The good <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> are most plenty in August and Septemher, and spring up in the open, sunny fields or commons, after low-lying fogs or soaking dews. The top is a dirty <ingredient>white,</ingredient>--<emph rend="italic">par complaisance,</emph> pearl-color,--the underside pink or <ingredient>salmon,</ingredient> changing to russet or brown soon after they are gathered. The poisonous sport all colors, and are usually far prettier than their virtuous kindred. Those which are dead-<ingredient>white</ingredient> above and below, as well as the stalk, are also to be let alone.

<pb n="245" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=243"/>
<p>
Cook a peeled <ingredient>white onion</ingredient> in the pot with your mush rooms. If it turn black, throw all away, and be properly thankful for your escape. It is also deemed safe to reject the mess of wild pottage, if, in stirring them, your silver spoon should blacken. But I certainly once knew a lady who did not discover until hers were eaten and partially digested, that the silver had come to grief in the discharge of duty. It was very dark, and required a deal of rubbing to restore cleanliness and polish; but the poison--if death were, indeed, in the pot--was slow in its effects, since she lived many years after the experiment. It is as well perhaps, though, not to repeat it too often.
</p>
<p>
To re-capitulate.--The eatable ones are round when they first show their <ingredient>heads</ingredient> in a critical world. As they grow, the lower part unfolds and reveals a lining of <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> fringe, while the stalk and top are dirty <ingredient>white.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> is more than twenty-four hours old, or within a few hours after it is gathered, the <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> changes to brown.

<p>
To guess (I do not say determine) whether an egg is good, shut one eye; frame the egg in the hollow of the hand, telescope-wise, and look at the sun through it with the open eye. If you can distinctly trace the outline of the yolk and the white looks clear around it, the chances are in favor of the egg and the buyer. Or, shake it gently at your ear. If addled, it will gurgle like water; if there is a chicken inside, you may distinguish a slight &quot;thud&quot; against the sides of the egg. Or, still again, you may try eggs from your own poultry-yard by putting them into a pan of cold water. The freshest sink first. Those that float are questionable-generally worse.
</p>
<p>
The best plan is to break them. In making cake, or anything that requires more than one, break each over a saucer, that it may be alone in its condemnation, if bad. Reject doubtful ones without hesitation. Yield implicit trust, or none at all.
</p>
<p>
Keep eggs in a cool, not cold place. Pack in bran or salt, with the small end downward, if you wish to use within two or three weeks; and furthermore, take the precaution to grease them well with linseed oil, or wash them over with
<pb n="253" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=251"/>
a weak solution of gum tragacanth or varnish. This excludes the air. Another way is to make some pretty strong lime-water, allowing a pound of lime to a gallon of boiling water. When perfectly cold, fill a large jar with it in which you have packed the eggs, small end downward; lay a light saucer upon the top to keep them under water, and keep in a cool place. Renew the lime-water every three weeks. You may add an ounce of saltpetre to it.
</p>
<p>
Eggs for boiling may be "canned" as follows: So soon as they are brought in from the nests, put two or three dozen at a time in a deep pan; pour scalding water over them; let it stand thirty seconds, and turn it all off. Cover immediately with more scalding water, and repeat the process yet the third time. Wipe dry, and pack in bran or salt when they cool. This hardens the albumen into an air-tight case for the yolk. Of course, you cannot use these eggs for cake or syllabubs, or anything that is prepared with whipped eggs. Pack with the small end down.

Still another is to put them in one of the silver <ingredient>egg</ingredient>-boilers used on the breakfast-table (a covered bowl will do as well); cover them with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and let them stand three minutes. Pour this off, and refill with more, also boiling hot, and leave them in it five minutes longer. Wrap in a napkin in a deep dish, if you have not a regular <ingredient>egg</ingredient>-dish.

<p>
A cool cellar is the best place in which to keep milk if you have no dairy or milk-room. Strain it into broad shallow pans which are lukewarm from recent scalding. You can get them made in one piece with no seams in which sour cream or dirt may lurk unsuspected. Set upon swing shelves, to avoid the possibilities of drowned miccj and keep the cellar dark to save it from flies. In twelve hours skim for the table, anJ, unless you have need of the milk, let it stand twelve hours more for the second rising of cream. Put this into the stone jar or crock in which the cream is kept for churning. Even in butter-making, I have found it a good plan to take off at night the cream clean from the morning churning, instead of letting it stand twenty-four hours, as is the usual custom. The " second rising" will repay one for the additional trouble. Churn as soon as convenient after the cream " loppers " or thickens. If it stand too long, it becomes bitter or musty. The churn should be well scalded and aired between the churn-ings. Scrupulous cleanliness should be the unbending rule of dairy arrangements. All strongly-flavored substances must he kept from the neighborhood of milk and butter. They are ready absorbents, and when they contract odor or
<pb n="264" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=262"/>
taste, never get, rid of it. Have earthen and tin milk-vessels, and never allow them to be put to any other use.
</p>
<p>
Scald the churn, and cool with ice or spring water; pour in the thick cream. Chum rather fast, until the butter-flakes left by the dasher upon the top, show that the end to be gained is near-then more slowly. The motion should always be regular. In warm weather pour a little cold water into the churn, should the butter come slowly. Take it up with the perforated dasher, turning it dexterously just below the surface of the butter-milk, to catch every stray bit. Have ready some clean, 
<emph rend="italic">very </emph><ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> in a deep wooden tray, and into this plunge the dasher when you draw it from the churn. The <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will <ingredient>float</ingredient> off, leaving the dasher free. Having collected every particle, gather behind a wooden <ingredient>butter</ingredient>-shovel and drain off the <ingredient>water</ingredient>-; squeezing and pressing the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> with the shovel. Set in a cool place for an hour to harden-a necessary measure in summer-then work and knead it with a wooden ladle until not another drop of <ingredient>water</ingredient> exudes, and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is like yellow marble in polish and closeness of pores.

<p>
If emminence of importance entitled a subject to preeminence of position, that of which we are now about to speak should have stood foremost in this work. It is not a pleasant thing to think or write about, but it is a stubborn fact that upon thousands of tables, in otherwise comfortable homes, good bread is an unknown phenomenon. I say phenomenon, because it would indeed be a marvellous estrangement of cause and effect were indifferent flour, unskilfully mixed with flat yeast, badly risen and negligently baked, to result in that pride of the notable housekeeper-light, sweet, wholesome bread. I know a household where sour, stiff bread is the rule, varied several times during the week by muffins scented and colored with soda, clammy biscuit, and leathery griddle-cakes; another, where the bread is invariably over-risen, and consequently tasteless, sometimes slightly acid; yet another in which home-made bread is not used at all, because it is &quot;so troublesome and uncertain,&quot; the mistress preferring to feed her family, growing children and all, upon the vari-colored sponges bought at the bakers sponges inflated with sal volatile, flavorless, and dry as chips when a day old, and too often betraying, in the dark streaks running through the interior of the loaf, want of cleanliness in the kneader. Yet these are all well-to-do people, who submit to these abominations partly because they do not know how badly off they are-chiefly because it is their way of doing, and they see no reason for changing. &quot;I have been a housekeeper for thirty years, and have always mixed my bread just so,&quot; retorted a mistress once, when I mildly set forth the advantages of "setting a sponge" over-night. "I put in flour, yeast, and milk if I have it, and give them a good stir; then set the dough down to rise. Our folks don't fancy very light bread. There don't seem
<pb n="270" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=268"/>
to be any substance in it-so to speak. Mine generally turns out pretty nice. It's all luck, after all, about bread."
</p>
<p>
"I'm told you have a receipt for making bread," laughed another to me; "I never heard of such a thing in my life, and I've been keeping house eighteen years. So I thought I'd call and ask you for it-just as a curiosity, you know. I want to see what it is like."
</p>
<p>
I wisely kept 
<emph rend="italic">my </emph>thoughts to myself, and dictated the receipt, which she jotted down in a memorandum-book, laughing all the while at the "excellent joke."
</p>
<p>
" You really use this ?" she demanded, when this wag done.
</p>
<p>
"I do. I have used no other for many years."
</p>
<p>
"And the bread I ate upon your table, the other night, was made according to this?"
</p>
<p>
Again an affirmative answer.
</p>
<p>
"I guess your cook could tell another story," rejoined the skeptic. "You can't make me believe that bread is made by rule. I put my materials together anyhow, and I have as good luck as most of my neighbors."
</p>
<p>
I regarded my visitor as an impertinent simpleton; but I have been amazed, in subsequent years, at finding that her creed is that of hundreds of housewives more or less sensible. "Luck" rules the baking, and upon the shoulders of this Invisible are laid the deficiencies of the complacent cook. Cheap flour and laziness are at the bottom of more mishaps in the bread line than any other combination of circumstances. From the inferior grades of flour, it is possible to make tolerable biscuit, crumpets, and muffins, plain pastry, and very good griddle-cakes. You cannot, by any stress of art, produce excellent bread from poor flour. It is no economy to purchase it for this purpose. It 
<emph rend="italic">is </emph>judicious to lay in two barrels at a time, and to use the best only for the semi- or tri-weekly baking.
</p>
<pb n="271" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=269"/>
<p>
Chiefest then among the conditions to good bread, I place good "family" flour-dry, elastic, and odorless. Whiteness is a secondary consideration, although, to American eyes, this is a recommendation. A little experience will teach you to detect the signs that foretell satisfactory baking-days, and 
<emph rend="italic">vice versa</emph>. If in handling the flour you discern a heaviness like that of ground plaster; if in squeezing a handful tightly you discover that it retains the imprint of palm and fingers, and rolls back into the tray a compact ball or roll; if it is in the least musty, or sour, use it very sparingly in your trial-baking, for the chances are as ten to one that you will head the barrel up again and return it to your grocer.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes new flour can be ripened for use by sifting enough for each baking into a large tray, and exposing it to the hot sun for some hours, or by setting it upon the kitchen hearth for the same time. And it not unfrequently happens that flour improves greatly after the barrel has been open for several days or weeks. It dries out and becomes lighter, more elastic. Next in importance to the quality of the flour is that of the yeast. This should be light in color and lively, effervescing easily when shaken, and emitting an odor like weak ammonia. If dull or sour, it is bad. In cities, it is easiest, perhaps cheapest, to buy yeast from a brewery or bakery, exercising your discrimination as to quality; unless you can satisfy yourself in this regard, you had better make your own. I can confidently recommend the receipts given in this work as easy and safe, having tried them in my own family.
</p>
<p>
Novices in bread-making, and many who should have learned better by long experience, fall into a sad mistake in the consistency of the dough. It should be mixed as 
<emph rend="italic">soft as it can be handled</emph>. Bread will rise sooner and higher, be lighter and move digestible, and keep fresh much
<pb n="272" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=270"/>
longer, if this rule be followed. Stiff bread is close in texture, often waxy to the teeth, and after a day or so become very hard.
</p>
<p>
Set the dough to rise in a moderately warm place, and keep it at an even temperature. There is force in the old lament- "My bread took cold, last night." Cold arrests the process of fermentation. There is a chance, should this occur, that a removal to a more genial atmosphere and careful nursing may cure the congestion, should it be only partial. Too much heat carries forward the work too rapidly. In this case, you will find your dough puffy and sour. Correct the latter evil by dissolving a little soda or saleratus in hot water and working it well in.
</p>
<p>
Knead your bread faithfully and from all sides, until it rebounds like india-rubber after a smart blow of the fist upon the centre of the mass.
</p>
<p>
The oven should not be too hot. If you cannot hold your bare arm within it while you count thirty, it is too quick. Keep the heat steady after the bread goes in. Too much fire at first, and rapid cooling, produce the effect upon the bread which is technically called "slack-baked," 
<emph rend="italic">i. e.</emph>, the inside of the loaf is never properly done. Practice and intelligent observation will, in time, make you an adept in the management of your ovens. If the bread rises rapidly while baking, and the crust begins to form before the lower part of the loaf is baked, cover the top with clean paper until you are ready to brown it.
</p>
<p>
Grate away the burned portions of the crust, should there be such. This is better than chipping with a knife. One of the best bread-makers I know bakes in round pans, each loaf by itself, and grates the whole outer surface, top, bottom, and sides, quickly and lightly, toning down the brown to a uniform and pleasing tint. Tilt your loaves upon the edge, the lower part resting upon the table, the
<pb n="273" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=271"/>
upper supported by the wall or other upright object, and throw a coarse dry cloth over them until they cool This position allows the air to get at all sides, and prevents "sweating." A tin bread-box is best, with a cloth at bottom and enwrapping the loaves.

Various brands of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> are so unequal with respect to the quantity of gluten they contain, that it is impossible to give any invariable rule on this subject. It will be safe, however, to sift two quarts and a pint, if you have set the potato sponge; two quarts for the plain. This will make two good-sized loaves. Make a hole in the middle of the heap, pour in the risen sponge (which should be very light and seamed in many places on the top), and work down the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into it with your hands. If too soft, add more <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> If you can mould it at all it is not too soft. If stiff rinse out the bowl in which the
<pb n="278" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=276"/>
sponge was set with a little <ingredient>lukewarm water,</ingredient> and work this in. When you have it in manageable shape, begin to knead, Work the mass into a ball--your hands having been well <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed from the first ; detach it from the tray, and lift it in your left hand, while you sprinkle <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the right thickly over the bottom and sides of the tray. Toss back the ball into this, and knead <ingredient>hard</ingredient>--always toward the centre of the mass, which should be repeatedly turned over and around, that every portion may be manipulated. Brisk and long kneading makes the pores fine and regular. Gaping holes of diverse sizes are an unerring tell-tale of a careless cook. Spend at least twenty minutes--half an hour is better--in this kind of useful gymnastics. It is grand exercise for arms and chest. This done, work the dough into a shapely ball in the centre of the tray, sprinkle <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over the top; throw a cloth over all and leave it on the kitchen-table to rise, taking care it is not in a draught of cold air. In summer, it will rise in four or five hours-in winter, six are often necessary. It should come up steadily until it at least trebles its original bulk and the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed surface cracks all over. Knead again for ten or fifteen minutes. Then, divide it into as many parts as you wish loaves, and put these in well-greased pans for the final rising. In a large household baking, it is customary to mould the dough into oblong rolls, three or four, according to the number of loaves you desire, and to lay these close together in one large pan. The second kneading is done upon a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed board, and should be thorough as the first, the dough being continually shifted and turned. Set the pans in a warm place for an hour longer, with a cloth thrown over them to keep out the air and dust. Then bake, heeding the directions set down in the article upon <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in general. If your ovens arc in good condition, one hour should bake the above quantity of <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> But here again experience must be
<pb n="279" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=277"/>
your guide. Note carefully for yourself how long a time is required for your first successful baking, as also Low much dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> you have worked into your sponge, and let these data regulate future action. I have known a variation of two quarts in a large baking, over the usual measure of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> I need not tell yon that you had better shun a brand that requires such an excessive quantity to bring the dough to the right consistency. It is neither nutritious nor economical. When you make out the loaves, prick the top with a fork.
</p>
<p>
Do not make your first baking too large. Practice is requisite to the management of an unwieldy mass of dough. Let your trial-loaf be with say half the quantity of sponge and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> I have set down, and increase these as skill and occasion require, carefully preserving the proportions. Seven or eight quarts of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> will be needed for the semi-weekly baking of a family of moderate size.
</p>
<p>
If I have seemed needlessly minute in the directions I have laid down, it is because I wish to be a guide, not a betrayer, and because I am deeply impressed with the worth of such advice as may tend to diminish the number of those who know not for themselves the comfort and delight of eating from day to day, and year to year, good family <ingredient>bread.</ingredient>

I only repeat the declaration of a majority of our best chemists and physicians when 1 say that our American fondness for fine <ingredient>white bread</ingredient> is a serious injury to our health.

It is wholesome, sweet, honest, and should be popular.
</p>
<p>
Prepare a sponge as for <ingredient>white bread,</ingredient> using <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>  or white flour. My rule is to take out a certain quantity of the risen sponge on baking day, and set aside for <ingredient>brown bread.</ingredient> Put into a tray two parts <ingredient>Graham flour,</ingredient> one-third <ingredient>white,</ingredient> and to every quart of this allow a handful of <ingredient>Indian meal,</ingredient> with a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Wet this up with the sponge, and when it is mixed, add, for a loaf of fair size, half a teacupful of <ingredient>molasses.</ingredient> The dough should be very soft. If there is not enough of the sponge to reduce it to the desired consistency, add a little blood-<ingredient>warm water.</ingredient> Knead it diligently and long. It will not rise so rapidly as the <ingredient>white flour,</ingredient> having more "body" to carry. Let it take its time; make into round, comfortable loaves, and set down again for the second rising, when you have again kneaded it. Bake steadily, taking care it does not burn, and do not cut while hot. The result will well repay you for your trouble. It will take a longer time to bake than <ingredient>white bread.</ingredient> Brown <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should not be sifted.

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading"><ingredient>CORN BREAD.</ingredient></purpose> There is a marked difference between the <ingredient>corn-meal</ingredient> ground at the South, and that which is sent out from Northern mills. If any one doubts this, it is not she who has perseveringly tried both kinds, and demonstrated to
<pb n="295" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=293"/>
her own conviction that the same treatment will not do for them. An intelligent lady once told me that the shape of the particles composing the meal was different-the one being round and smooth, the other angular. I am inclined to believe this. The Southern meal is certainly coarser, And the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> made from it less compact. Moreover, there is a partiality at the North for yellow meal, which the Southerners regard as only fit for <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> and cattle-feed. The yellow may be the sweeter, but I acknowledge that I have never succeeded in making really nice <ingredient>bread</ingredient> from it.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> should be purchased in small quantities, except for a very large family. It is apt to heat, mould, and grow musty, if kept long in bulk or in a warm place. If not sweet and dry, it is useless to expect good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or cakes. As an article of diet, especially in the early warm days of spring, it is healthful and agreeable, often acting as a gentle corrective to bile and other disorders. In winter, also, it is always acceptable upon the breakfast or supper table, being warming anil nutritious. In summer the free use of it is less judicious, on account of its laxative properties. As a kindly variation in the routine of fine <ingredient>white bread</ingredient> and baker's rolls, it is worth the attention of every housewife. " John and the children" will like it, if it approximates the fair standard of excellence; and I take it, my good friend-you who have patiently kept company with me from our prefatory talk until now- that you love them well enough to care for their comfort and likings.
</p>
<p>
"My husband is wild about <ingredient>corn bread,</ingredient>" a wife remarked to me not a hundred years ago, " but I won't make it for him; it is such a bother! And if I once indulge him, he will give me no peace."
</p>
<p>
Beloved sister, I am persuaded better things of you. Good husbands cannot be spoiled by petting. Bad ones
<pb n="296" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=294"/>
cannot be made worse-they may be made better. It seems a little thing, so trifling in its consequences, you need not tire further your aching back and <ingredient>feet</ingredient> to accomplish it- the preparation of John's favorite dish when he does not expect the treat-to surprise him when he comes in cold and hungry, by setting before him a dish of hot <ingredient>milk-toast,</ingredient> or a loaf of <ingredient>corn-bread,</ingredient> brown and crisp without, yellow and spongy within, instead of the stereotyped pile of cold slices, brown or <ingredient>white.</ingredient> If he were consulted, he would say, like the generous soul he is-" Don't take one needless step for me, dear," And he would mean it. But for all that, he will enjoy your little surprise-ay! and love you the better for it. It is the "little by little " that makes up the weal and woe of life.
</p>
<p>
May I make this digression longer yet, by telling you what I overheard a husband say to a wife the other day, when he thought no one else was near enough to hear him ? He is no gourmand, but he is very partial to a certain kind of cruller which nobody else can make, he thinks, so well as his little wife. It so chanced that in frying some of these she scalded her hand badly. After it was bandaged, she brought up a plate of the cakes for his luncheon. He looked at them, then at her, with a loving, mournful smile.
</p>
<p>
"I can understand now," said he, " how David felt when his men-of-war brought him the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from the well of Bethlehem."
</p>
<p>
Then he stooped and kissed the injured fingers. Yet he has been married nearly twenty years. I was not ashamed that my eyes were moist. I honored him the more that his were dim.

If you have not used your griddle or waffle-iron for some time, wash it off hard with hot soap and water; wipe and rub well with dry salt. Heat it and grease with a bit of fat salt pork on a fork. It is a mistake, besides being slovenly and wasteful, to put on more grease than is absolutely necessary to prevent the cake from sticking. A piece of pork an inch square should last for several days. Put on a great spoonful of butter for each cake, and before filling the griddle test it with a single cake, to be sure that all is right with it as well as the batter.

The same rules apply to waflles. Always lay hot cakes and waffles upon a hot plate as soon as baked.

<p>
Use none but the best materials for making cake. If you cannot afford to get good flour, dry white sugar, and the best family butter, make up your mind to go without your cake, and eat plain bread with a clear conscience.
</p>
<p>
There are no intermediate degrees of quality in eggs. I believe I have said that somewhere else, but it ought to be repeated just here. They should be, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. A tin whisk or whip is best for beating them. All kinds of cake are better for having the
<pb n="311" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=309"/>
whites and yolks beaten separately. Beat the former in a large shallow dish until you can cut through the froth with a knife, leaving as clear and distinct an incision as you would in a solid substance. Beat the yolks in an earthen-ware bowl until they cease to froth, and thicken as if mixed with flour. Have the dishes 
<emph rend="italic">cool</emph>-not too cold. It is <ingredient>hard</ingredient> to <ingredient>whip whites</ingredient> stiff in a warm room.
</p>
<p>
Stir the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> Cakes often fail because this rule is not followed. Beat these us faithfully as you do the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> warming the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> very slightly if <ingredient>hard.</ingredient> Use only a silver or wooden spoon in this as in other parts of your work. I have heard of silver <ingredient>egg-whip</ingredient> but they are not likely to come into general use; except where the mistress makes all the cake, pudding, etc.
</p>
<p>
Do not use fresh and stale <ingredient>milk</ingredient> in the same cake. It acts as disastrously as a piece of new cloth in an old garment. <ingredient>Sour milk</ingredient> makes a spongy cake; sweet, one closer in grain.
</p>
<p>
Study the moods and tenses of your oven carefully before essaying a loaf of cake. Confine your early efforts to <ingredient>tea</ingredient>-cakes and the like. Jelly-cake, baked in shallow flat this, is good practice during the novitiate. Keep the heat steady, and as good at bottom as hot
</p>
<p>
Streaks in cake are caused by unskilful mixing, too rapid or unequal baking, or a sudden decrease in heat before the cake is quite done.
</p>
<p>
Don't delude yourself, and maltreat those who are to eat your cake, by trying to make <ingredient>soda</ingredient> do the whole or most of the duty of <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Others have tried it before, with unfortunate results. If curiosity tempt you to the experiment, you had better allay it by buying some sponge-cake at the corner bakery.
</p>
<p>
Test whether a coke is done by running a clean straw into the thickest part. It should come up clean.
</p>
<p>
Do not leave the oven door open, or change the cake
<pb n="312" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=310"/>
from one oven to the other, except in extreme cases. If it harden too fast on the top, cover with <ingredient>paper.</ingredient> It should rise to full height before the crust forms.
</p>
<p>
Except for gingerbread, use none but <ingredient>white sugar.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Always sift the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Be accurate in your weights and measures.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">There is no short road to good fortune in cake-making. What is worth doing at all is worth doing well.</emph> There is no disgrace in not having time to mix and bake a cake. You may well be ashamed of yourself if you are too lazy, or careless, or hurried to beat your <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>cream</ingredient> your <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or measure your ingredients.
</p>
<p>
Yet, sometimes, when you believe you have left no means untried to deserve success, failure is your portion. What then?
</p>
<p>
If the cake be uneatable, throw it away upon the first beggar-boy who comes for broken <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and say nothing about it. If streaky or burned, cut out the best parts, make them presentable as possible, and give them to John and the children as a " second-best" treat. Then keep up a brave <ingredient>heart</ingredient> and try again. You 
<emph rend="italic">may</emph> not satisfy yourself in a dozen trials. You certainly 
<emph rend="italic">will</emph> not, if you never make another attempt.
</p>
<p>
Cake should be wrapped in a thick cloth as soon as cool, and kept in tight tin boxes. Do not cut more at a time than you are likely to use, as it is not good when dry. Jelly-cakes are best set away upon plates, cloths wrapped closely about them, and a box enclosing all.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Cream</ingredient> your <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> measure <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>spices,</ingredient> etc., before beginning work. For <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-cake it is best to prepare the materials the day before. Let your icing dry thoroughly before wrapping up the cake.

A few minutes later, throw in more <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and keep adding it at intervals until it is all used up. Beat perseveringly-always with a regular, sweeping movement of the whisk-until the icing is of A smooth, fine, and firm texture. Half an hour's beating should be sufficient, if done well. If not stiff enough, put in more <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> A little practice will teach you when your end is gained. If you season with <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> allow, in measuring your <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> for the additional liquid. <ingredient>Lemon-juice</ingredient> or a very little <ingredient>tartaric acid</ingredient> whitens the icing.

<p>
This method of making icing was taught me by a confectioner, as easier and surer than the old plan of beating the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> first and alone. I have used no other since my first trial of it. The frosting hardens in one-fourth. the time required under the former plan, and not more than half the time is consumed in the manufacture. I have often iced a cake but two hours before it was cut, and found the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> dry all through.
</p>
<p>
Pour the icing by the spoonful on the top of the cake and near the centre of the surface to be covered. If the loaf is of such a shape that the liquid will settle of itself to its place, it is best to let it do so. If you spread it, use a broad-bladed knife, dipped in <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> If it is as thick with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> as it should be, you need not lay on more than one coat. You may set it in a moderate oven fox three minutes, if you are in great haste. The better plan is to

dry in a sunny window, where the air can get at it, and where there is no dust.

The lady from whom I had this admirable receipt was celebrated among her acquaintances for her beautiful and delicious sponge-cake.
</p>
<p>
"Which should always be baked in tins like these," she said to me once, sportively, "or it does not taste just right."
</p>
<p>
The moulds were like a large brick in shape, with almost perpendicular sides. I instantly gave an order for a couple precisely like them, and really fancied that cake baited in them was a little better than in any other form. But you can hardly fait of success if you prepare yours precisely as I have directed, bake in whatever shape you will. Be careful that your oven is steady, and cover the cake with <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> to prevent burning.
</p>
<p>
It is a good plan to line the pans in which sponge-cake is baked with buttered <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> fitted neatly to the sides and bottom.

This is for a large quantity of crullers. Roll out in a thin sheet, cut into shapes with a jagging-iron, and fry in 
<emph rend="italic">plenty</emph> of boiling <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> Test the heat first by dropping in one. It should rise almost instantly to the surface. Crullers and doughnuts soak in <ingredient>fat</ingredient> at the bottom of the kettle. These should be a fine yellow.
</p>
<p>
The most delicious and the nicest-looking crullers I have ever seen were made by the dear old lady from whom I had this receipt. They were as pretty and perfect a picture of their kind as she was of hers.
</p>
<p>
Crullers are better the second day than the first. If the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> becomes so hot that the crullers brown before they puff out to their full dimensions, take the kettle from the fire for a few minutes. Have enough cut out before you begin to fry them, to keep a good supply all the while on the fire. If you undertake the task alone, cut out all before, cooking one.

Use none but the best butter in pastry.
</p>
<p>
"Cooking butter is a good tiling," said a grave epicure to me once, " an admirable thing-in its place, which is in the soap-fat kettle or upon wagon-wheels !"
</p>
<p>
It is certainly out of place in biscuits, cake, or in any substance destined for human palates and stomachs. It is never less in place than in pastry; never betrays its vileness more surely and odiously.
</p>
<pb n="350" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=348"/>
<p>
Butter intended for pastry should be washed carefully in several clear, cold waters, and kneaded while under water, to extract the salt. Then wipe it dry, and lay it in a cold place until you are ready to work it in
</p>
<p>
" Keep cool," is a cardinal motto for pastry-makers. A marble slab is a good thing to roll out paste upon. Next to this, the best article is a 
<emph rend="italic">clean</emph> board of <ingredient>hard</ingredient> wood, which is never used for any other purpose. It is harder to make good pastry in warm weather than cold, on account of the tendency of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and thus render the crust heavy and solid.
</p>
<p>
Few people know what really good pastry is. Fewer still can make it. It has no inevitable resemblance either to putty or leather. It 
<emph rend="italic">is</emph> light, crisp, flaky, goodly to behold--goodlier to the taste.
</p>
<p>
" <ingredient>Pork fat</ingredient> and pies kill more people yearly in the United States than do liquor and <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient>" said a popular lecturer upon conservatism.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps so; but I incline to the belief that bad pastry is answerable for a vast majority of the murders. Not that I recommend pies of any description as healthful daily food -least of all for children. But since they are eaten freely all over our land, let us make them as wholesome and palatable as possible.

<ingredient>water</ingredient> into a stiff dough, working it with a wooden spoon until obliged to make it into a roll or ball with your hands. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> these, and knead the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> into shape with as few strokes as will effect your end. Lay the Lump upon a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed kneading-board and roll it out into a thin sheet, always rolling from you with quick, light action. When thin enough, stick bits of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in regular Jose rows all over the sheet, using a knife for this purpose rather than your hands. Roll up the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> into close folds as you would a sheet of music. Flatten it that your rolling-pin can take hold, and roll out again as thin as before, Baste, roll up and then out, until your <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is gone. It is a good plan to sprinkle the inside of each, sheet with a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> after buttering it, before making it into a roll. Finally, make out your crust; <ingredient>butter</ingredient> your pie-plates, lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> lightly within them, cut it off evenly about the edges after fitting it neatly; gather up the scraps left from cutting, and make into another sheet. If the pies are to have a top crust, fill the plates with <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or whatever you have ready, lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> on this, cut it to fit, and press down the edges to prevent the escape of the <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> with a spoon, knife, or jagging-iron, ornamenting It in a regular figure.
</p>
<p>
Bake in a moderate oven until a light brown. Be particularly careful to have your heat as great at the bottom as at the top, or the lower crust will be clammy and raw.
</p>
<p>
Pastry is always best when fresh.
</p>
<p>
It is well, when you can spare the time, to lay the roll, when all the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is used up, in a very cold place for fifteen minutes or so before rolling it into crust. Indeed, some good housewives let it stand on the ice an hour in hot weather. They say it tends to make it flaky as well as firm.
</p>
<p>
Touch as little with your hards as may be practicable.

I take this opportunity of warning the innocent reader against placing any confidence whatever in <ingredient>dried currants.</ingredient> 1 years ago gave over trying to guess who put the dirt in them. It is always there! gravel-stones lurking under a specious coating of curranty-looking <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> to crucify grown people's nerves and children's teeth; mould that changes to mud in the mouth; twigs that prick the throat, not to mention the <ingredient>legs,</ingredient> <ingredient>wings,</ingredient> and bodies of tropical insects-a curious study to one interested in the entomology of Zante. It is all 
<emph rend="italic">dirt</emph>! although sold to us at 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>currant</ingredient></emph> prices.
</p>
<p>
Wash your <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> therefore, first in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> rolling up your sleeves, and rubbing the conglomerate masses apart, as you would scrub a muddy garment. Drain them in a cullender, and pass them through three more waters-cold now, but cleansing. Then spread them upon a large dish, and enter seriously upon your geological and entomological researches. "Sultanas"-sweet and <ingredient>seed</ingredient>-less-are nearly as troublesome, but their specialty is more harmless, being stickiness and stems.

<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" size="larger">SERVANTS.</purpose> SOME years ago-more than I care to count over-I read a lively little book entitled, "The Greatest Plague of Life." I have forgotten who wrote it, if I ever knew. It was in the form of an autobiography; the heroine called herself, with an amusing affectation of disguise, " Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n," and it was illustrated by George Cruikshank. I read it aloud in my home-circle, and many a hearty laugh we had over the poor lady's perplexities and calamities.
</p>
<p>
Reading the history as a clever burlesque, I suffered
<pb n="371" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=369"/>
no appreciable draught upon my sympathies until time and experience brought me in contact with so many who echoed her plaint, that I could not but recur, now and then, with a half-sad smile, to her sufferings under the rule of Norah, who chased her up-stairs with a carving-knife; with Mary, who drank up the <ingredient>cherry</ingredient>-brandy, filled the bottle with cold weak <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> and kept her pitying employers up all night to pull her through an epileptic fit; with John, who never answered the parlor bell "unless they persewered; " whose Stomach could not <ingredient>bear cold meat</ingredient> at dinner, but rallied bravely under a couple of pounds at supper. There was one nursery-maid who whipped Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n's child, and another who upset the perambulator in the park, and, too much absorbed in the suit of a whiskered Guardsman to note what had happened, went on dragging the carriage upon its side until the baby's cheek was cruelly scarified by the gravel-besides a host of other 
<emph rend="italic">un</emph>worthies set for the distress of Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n's mind, body, and estate.
</p>
<p>
"Douglas Jerrold wrote that book," interrupted a friend at my elbow. "And, 
<emph rend="italic">apropos de bottes</emph>, have you seen Punch's recent article, 'Servantgalism; or, What Shall Be Done With the Missusses?"
</p>
<p>
"The malady in America must <ingredient>bear</ingredient> another name," remarks a lady, gayly. "We have no servants-at least in this region. My cook is forty-seven years old, and my chambermaid a widow, who has buried two children; yet they would be highly affronted were I to speak of them except as 'girls.' It is a generic term that belongs to the class 'who live out,' from sixteen up to sixty. I bad a lesson on this <ingredient>head</ingredient> not a month since. My laundress, who has lived with me six years, was thanking me for a service I had done her brother.
</p>
<p>
"'I'll never forget you for it, mem,' she sobbed. 'I'll bless you for it, on me knees, night and morning.'

"I am glad I have been able to help your friends, Katy," I said. " You have been a faithful servant to me---"
</p>
<p>
She cut my sentence in the middle by walking out of the room-I supposed, to conceal her emotions. I was un-deceived, five minutes later, when her angry tones reached me from the kitchen, the door of which she had left open,
</p>
<p>
"I'll never believe a person has a good <ingredient>heart,</ingredient> or deserves to be called a Christian, who names an honest, respectable girl who tries to do her duty, a servant! ' A faithful servant! ' says she ; ' as if she was a queen and meself a beggar !'"
</p>
<p>
"What did you say to the ungrateful wretch? " asks a listener, indignantly.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing. I went quietly out of hearing, reminded, for the hundredth time, of Solomon's warning, 'Take no <ingredient>head</ingredient> unto all words that are spoken, lest then hear thy servant curse' thee.' I recalled, too, the saying of a mightier than the Royal Preacher: 'Whosoever will be greatest among you, let him be your<emph rend="italic"> servant</emph>.'"
</p>
<p>
"I thought you were one of the favored few who had no trouble with, them," says another housekeeper, sighingly. "There is real comfort,-excuse me, my dear Mrs. Sterling,-but it is refreshing to a wearied soul to know that you have felt some of our tribulations. It seems to me, at times, that there is no other affliction worthy the name when compared with what we endure from the 'Necessary Evil.' I have tried all sorts-the representatives from every nation under heaven, I verily believe-and 
<emph rend="italic">they are all alike!</emph> They will wear me, into an untimely grave yet,"
</p>
<p>
"I wouldn't let them, my dear Martha," replies Mrs. Sterling, with her sunny smile. "If evils, they are surely minor afflictions. And, after all, I imagine 'they' are a good deal like the rest of man and womankind-pretty
<pb n="373" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=371"/>
much as you choose to take them. The truth is, there is no justice in wholesale denunciation of any class. You recollect the Western orator's truism, 'Human nature, Mr. President, nine cases out of ten, is human nature. When I consider the influences under which a majority of our servants have been reared-ignorance, poverty, super stition, often evil example in their homes-my wonder is, not at the worthlessness of some, but that so many are virtuous, honest, and orderly. You will allow that, as a general thing, they are quite as industrious as their mistresses, and control their tempers almost as well. And we make so many mistakes in our dealings with them!"
</p>
<p>
My old friend does not often lecture, but she has something to say now, and forgets herself in her subject.
</p>
<p>
"We err so grievously in our management, that a sense of our failures should teach its charity. Do we understand, ourselves, what is the proper place of a hired 'help' in our families? If it is the disposition of Mrs. Shoddy to trample upon them as soulless machines, Mrs. Kindly makes a sort of <ingredient>elder</ingredient> daughter of her maid; indulges, consults, and confides in her, and wonders, by-and-by, to find herself under Abigail's thumb-her husband and children subject to the caprices of a pampered menial. I never hear a lady say of a valued domestic, 'I could not get along without her,' without anticipating as a certainty the hour when she shall announce, 'There 
<emph rend="italic">is </emph>such a thing as keeping a servant too long.' The crisis comes, then, to Mrs. Kindly. In a moment of desperation she frees her <ingredient>neck</ingredient> from the yoke. Abigail packs her six trunks, having entered Mrs. Kindly's service, seven years before, with her worldly all done up in a newspaper, shakes the dust off the <ingredient>neat</ingredient> Balmoral boots which have replaced her brogans, against the heartless tyrant who sits crying, in her own room up-stairs, over thoughts of how Abigail has been so clean, quick, and
<pb n="374" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=372"/>
devoted to her interests; how she has nursed her a long and dangerous illness, and had the charge of Emma and Bobby from their birth. She has prepared a handsome present for her in memory of all this, and is hurt more than by anything else when she learns that the girl has taken her final departure without even kissing the baby.
</p>
<p>
"It is not strange that the deceived mistress should, from that day, write down Abigail a monster of ingratitude, and forgot the faithful service of years in the <ingredient>smart</ingredient> of wounded feeling; when the truth is that she did the maid more injury by injudicious petting, than the latter could do her mistress had she absconded with all the plate in the house. She has, as might have been expected, proved Abigail's unfitness to be her confidante and co-adviser; but, at the same time, she has filled her <ingredient>brain</ingredient> with notions of her superiority to her fellow-servants, her <ingredient>heart</ingredient> with burnings for the higher station, she can never occupy.
</p>
<p>
"I speak feelingly upon this subject," continues Mrs. Sterling, with a laugh; "for I was once led into this very mistake myself, by the attractive qualities of a young woman who lived with me nine years as seamstress and chambermaid. She was so even-tempered, so sensible, industrious, and respectful, that she gained upon the esteem of us all. One day, while we sat together at work, I told her of some family changes in prospect, prefacing the communication by the remark, 'I want to speak to you of something, Eliza, which you must not mention to any one else at present. The interests of an employer and a servant should be the same.'
</p>
<p>
"Then, very foolishly, I opened up my mind freely on the subject that engaged it. She answered modestly, but intelligently, entering into my plans with such <ingredient>cordial</ingredient> interest and pledges of cooperation, that I went to prepare for a walk, feeling really strengthened and cheered by the
<pb n="375" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=373"/>
talk. At the front door I was met by a letter requiring an immediate reply. Returning to my chamber to lay off my hat and shawl, I heard Eliza talking loudly and gleefully, in the adjoining sewing-room, with the cook, whom she must have called up-stairs through the speaking-tube. You cannot imagine, nor I describe, my sensations at listening, against my will, to an exaggerated account of the interview which had just taken place. Not only my language, but my tones were mimicked with great gusto and much laughter by my late confidante-the phrase 'The interests of the employer and the servant should be the same' occurring again and again, and forming, apparently, the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> of the joke. I was very angry. But for the rule adopted early in my married life, never to reprove a servant when out of humor, I should instantly have ordered the treacherous creature-as I named her--from the house. I sat down instead, to cool off and to think. With reflection, common sense rallied to my aid.
</p>
<p>
"'The girl does well enough in her place, which is that of a hired chambermaid and seamstress,' said this monitor. 'She knew her position, and would have kept it, but for your folly in dragging her up to temporary equality with yourself. You made yourself ridiculous, and she was shrewd enough to see it. Take the lesson to <ingredient>heart;</ingredient> write it out in full for future guidance, and keep your own, counsel.'
</p>
<p>
"Eliza never suspected my discovery. She remained with me until her marriage a year afterward, and we parted upon good terms."
</p>
<p>
I have quoted from my friend at length, because I honor her excellent judgment and mature experience, and because 1 agree so fully with her touching the evil of so-called confidential servants. The principle of acknowledged favoritism is ruinous to domestic comfort, let who may be the
<pb n="376" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=374"/>
object thus distinguished. Rely upon it, my dear lady, at least one-third of home-wrangles and social scandal arises from this cause. Be assured, also, that if you do not perceive the impropriety of lowering yourself to the level of your subordinates, 
<emph rend="italic">they </emph>will, and gauge their behavior accordingly. The connection is an unnatural one, and, like all others of the kind, must terminals disastrously in time. Then the discarded favorite, aggrieved and exasperated, leaves your house to tattle in the <ingredient>ears</ingredient> of some other indiscreet mistress, of your sayings and doings. Show your servant that you respect yourself and her too truly to forget what is clue to hath. Be kind, pleasant, always reasonable and attentive to her needs, willing to hearken to and meet any lawful request. Make her comfortable, and, so far as you can, happy.
</p>
<p>
Excuse one more quotation from Mrs. Sterling, whom, when I was much younger than I am now, I consulted with regard to the just medium between familiarity and austerity.
</p>
<p>
"Remember they are human beings, and treat them as such," she said. "Not that you are likely to reap a large reward in their gratitude, but because it is right, and because you find no exceptions to the practice of the Golden Rule laid down in the Bible. Be faithful in your obedience to the law of kindness. With the return tide you have nothing to do. This is a safe and straight path, I believe it to be also the smoothest. You will be better and more cheerfully served than your neighbor, who, recognizing in every hireling a natural enemy, is always on the defensive."
</p>
<p>
I have found the most serious obstacle to a comfortable pursuance of her safe path, to lie in this same prejudice-rooted by centuries of misunderstandings and caste-wars the belief of necessary antagonism between employers and employed, Mrs. Sterlings Eliza only expressed the pre-
<pb n="377" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=375"/>
vailing sentiment of her class, when she ridiculed her mistress' proposition that their interests ought to he identical. I have failed so often and so signally in the endeavor to impress the merits of this policy upon domestics, that I rarely attempt it now. There is always a suspicion--more or less apparent-that you have a single eye to self-interest in all your regulations and counsels. "What does she hope to gain? What am I in danger of losing?" are the queries that invariably present themselves to the subordinate's mind. The arguments by which your plans are supported are thrown away upon ignorant and illogical listeners-your array of facts totally disbelieved. Your auditor does not say this, but in divers and ingenious ways she contrives to let you know that she is not so silly as to be imposed upon by the specious array of evidence.
</p>
<p>
For how much of this are mistresses responsible? Has this creed of distrust been learned by experience of injustice or exaction, or is it one of the popular prejudices, which are harder to overthrow than sound and well-established principle? Of one thing I am certain: Mistresses and maids would more speedily come to a right understanding of oneness of interest but for the influence exerted over the former by Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Robinson, and Mrs. Brown, who don't allow this, and couldn't think of that, and never heard of the other privilege or immunity being granted to servants. Before they would yield such a point, or submit to one syllable of dictation, they would do all their own work, etc., etc. Poor Mrs. Pliable, listening dumbly and meekly, goes home with a low-spirited sense of her own pusillanimity upon her, and tries to assert her authority and redeem past faults by a sudden tightening of the reins that results in a runaway and general smash-up.
</p>
<p>
Cannot we remember--you and I--my dear reader, that we may sometimes be as nearly right as those who talk more
<pb n="378" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=376"/>
loudly and strongly than we upon domestic economy, laying down rules we never thought of suggesting; splitting into ninths a hair our short-sighted eyes cannot make out when whole, and annihilating our timid objections with a lordly "<emph rend="italic">I</emph> always do so," which is equal to a decree of infallibility? Cannot we make up our minds, once and for all, to be a law unto ourselves in all matters pertaining to our households? Mrs. Jones' rule maybe good for her; Mrs. Robinson's better than any other in her particular case, and Mrs. Brown's best of all for one in her peculiar circumstances; yet any one or all of them bo unsuitable for our use.
</p>
<p>
Avoid talking about your domestic affairs with people whose gossip on these topics is incessant. You are angry when a whiff of some such discussion as enlightened Mrs. Sterling, with regard to our mistake, is wafted to you through the dumb-waiter or register, an accident that will occur while the tones of the plaintiffs are loud and untrained by education or policy. It is mean and unkind-traitorous in fact, you say, for them so to misrepresent and revile you-after all the kindness you have showed to them, too! Bridget, Chloe, or Grutchen, passing the parlor-door and catching the sound of her name as roughly handled, may have her own sensations, and draw her own inferences-<emph rend="italic">being human like yourself</emph>. It is tiresome and vulgar, this everlasting exchange of experiences about "my girl," and "your girl," and everybody else's "girl." It is time sensible women ceased, in this respect, to imitate the fashion of the class they censure, and put down the bootless tattle with a strong will. Order your household, then, so far aright as you can by the help of common sense and grace from on high, and let Mesdames Jones, Robinson, and Brown look to the ways of their own, and expend their surplus energies upon their neighbors' concerns-counting you out.
</p>
<pb n="379" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=377"/>
<p>
(I believe that is slang, but let it stand!)
</p>
<p>
These worthy and fussy housewives act upon the supposition that all "girls" are cast in the same mould. Being human (do nob let us forget that!), the probability is, that there are varieties of the species.
</p>
<p>
But, if the mistresses are led by their associates, the "girl's" "acquaintances" sway her yet more powerfully. Every conscientious, well-meaning housewife knows what a brake is this informal, but terrible "Union" upon her endeavors to improve and really benefit those under her direction. I have been amazed and disgusted at the tyranny exercised by this irresponsible body over the best servants I have ever seen.
</p>
<p>
"We would be hooted at, ma'am, if we didn't give in to them," said one, when I represented how senseless and almost suicidal was the course recommended by these evil advisers. "There's not a girl in town would speak to us if we didn't join in with the rest. It's like a strike, you see-awful upon them as holds back."
</p>
<p>
Do not, then, my discouraged fellow-laborer, imagines that I am ignorant of your trials, your doubts, your disheartening experiences. If I disagree with Mrs. S-k-n-s-t-n and do not pronounce our servants to be the greatest plague of life inclining rather to the belief that-always allowing for human nature and the drawbacks I have enumerated-good mistresses are apt to make good servants, it is in consequence of long and careful study and observation of the practical working of Mrs. Sterling's rule. Like begets like. Pleasant words are more likely to be answered by pleasant than are <ingredient>tart</ingredient> or hasty ones. If you would have your servants respectful to you, be respectful to them. The best way to teach them politeness is by example. It should not cost you an effort to say, "Thank you," or "If you please." The habit exerts an unconscious
<pb n="380" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=378"/>
refining influence upon them, and you dignify instead of degrading your ladyhood by being pitiful and courteous to all. If you can only maintain your position by haughtiness and chilling disregard of the feelings of inferiors, your rank is false, or you unfit to hold it.
</p>
<p>
To begin, then: Be mistreat of yourself. Amid all your temptations to angry or sarcastic speech (and how many and how strong these are, you and I know), curb yourself with the recollection that it is despicable, no less than useless, to say cutting things to one who has no right to retort upon you in kind.
</p>
<p>
"Ma'," says Miss Aurelia in Miss Sedgwick's admirable story, "Live and let Live"-"how can. you let your help be so saucy to you?"
</p>
<p>
Master Julius, who was standing by, took a different view of the matter.
</p>
<p>
"If Ma' doesn't want her help to be 
<emph rend="italic">sarcy </emph>to her," he said, "she hadn't ought to be 
<emph rend="italic">sarcy </emph>to them."
</p>
<p>
Teach your children the like forms of kindly speech and habits of consideration for the comfort and happiness of your domestics, checking with equal promptness undue freedom and the arrogance of station. It is as graceful to bend as it is mean to grovel.
</p>
<p>
Learn not to see everything, and, so soon as you can, put far from you the delusive hope that anybody else-- unless it be dear old John--will ever serve you as well as you would serve yourself. This failure is attributable to some one of the nine-tenths we spoke of just now. She is a prudent housekeeper who can wink at trifling blemishes without effort or parade. There is one tost which has come into my troubled mind hundreds of times on such occasions, calming perturbation into solemnity, and bringing, I hope, charity with humility :-
</p>
<pb n="381" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=379"/>
<p>
"If 
<emph rend="italic">Thou</emph>, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"
</p>
<p>
But if your hold of the rein be gentle, let it also be firm. Never forget that the house is yours, and that you-not hirelings-are responsible for the disposition of the stores purchased with John's money.
</p>
<p>
"I was much amused the other day," said an easy-tempered lady to me, "at a talk that passed under my window between my new cook and one of her visitors.
</p>
<p>
"'And how are ye gitting along?' asked the guest.
</p>
<p>
"'Oh! pretty well-ish, now,' was the reply.' I was a-feard, when I first come, that 
<emph rend="italic">she </emph> would bother me a-trot-ting down into the kitchen so constant. But I give her a hint as how that wasn't the trick of a raal lady, and she's kep' out nicely sence then. You've got to stand up for your own rights in this wurrld, or you'll be trod upon.'"
</p>
<p>
Now, it would be throwing away words to reason with, a woman like that cook, or a mistress might show that in no other department of labor would such a principle be tolerated-that from the Secretary of State down to the scavenger who empties your ash-pan, every employ&#233; who draws wages has an overlooker, to whom he is accountable for the manner in which his work is done and his money earned; and that the fact that she is an ignorant, high-tempered woman is no just cause of exemption. Yet in how many families is this point tacitly yielded, and the mistress admitted upon sufferance to her own kitchen-the room furnished with her money, and in which she hardly dare touch or look at the articles intended for the consumption of her own family?
</p>
<p>
One often hears such remarks as, "It isn't every girl who will stand having the mistress popping in and out while she is at work." When, in any other situation, the very fact of this unwillingness to have the owner of the
<pb n="382" id="comm380"/>
materials used in that work present, would be strong presumptive proof of negligence or dishonesty. The principle is pernicious from beginning to end, and should not be tolerated for an instant.
</p>
<p>
It gives me pleasure to state here, that I know nothing personally of this curious reversal of the rights of employer and domestic. I am inclined to believe, if one-half I hear of other housewives' trials be true, that I have been highly favored among American women. My authority in the kitchen, as in other parts of the household, has never been disputed - in my hearing or presence, that is. I have always met with a cheerful reception below-stairs when I appeared there to direct or share the labors of my cooks; have found them willing to undertake new dishes, and ready to learn my "way," however unlike it might be to their own. As a rule, also,- to which the exceptions have been few and very far between, - those employed by me have been cleanly, industrious, kind-hearted, and respectful; patient under inconveniences, and attentive in sickness. I should not, therefore, do my duty, did I not lift my voice in a plea for charitable judgment, just and generous treatment of a class which, however faulty, have much to do and to endure. Mrs. Skinflint's grocer's account may be less than yours, if you adopt this policy - Mrs. Sharp's coal-cellar be better dusted, and the paint in her attic scrubbed oftener; but I believe, in the long run, you will be the most comfortable in body as in conscience. Your machinery will move with fewer jerks and less friction. Your servants will remain with you longer, and be better-tempered while they stay, if you show that you appreciate the fact of a common humanity; that you owe them duties you are resolved to fulfil during their sojourn under your roof, however mercenary may be their performance of those devolving upon them.

Finally, dear sister, do not add to the real miseries of life by regarding the annoyance of a careless, slothful, or impertinent domestic as a real trouble. Class it with petty vexations which are yet curable as well as endurable, and live above it--a noble, beneficent existence in the love of your fellow-creatures and the fear of GOD--a life that can not suffer perceptible disturbance from such a contemptible rootlet of bitterness as this. It is only the feeble, the inefficient, or the indolent mistress whose peace of mind is dependent upon such casualties as a breeze, a hurricane, or a sudden vacancy in the department of the interior.

<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<hd align="center">BOILED PUDDINGS.</hd>
<p>
You can boil puddings in a bowl, a mould, or a cloth. The mould should have a closely-fitting top and be buttered well-top and all-before the batter or dough is put in.
<pb n="407" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=405"/>
These moulds are usually made with hasps or other fastening. In lack of this, you had better tie down the cover securely. I once boiled a pudding in a tin pail, the top of which I made more secure by fitting it over a cloth floured on the inside, lest the pudding should stick. The experi-ment succeeded admirably, and I commend the suggestion to those who find, after the pudding is mixed, that their mould leaks, or the bowl that did duty as a substitute has been broken, and nothing said to "the mistress" about it. If you use a bowl, butter it, and tie a floured cloth tightly over the top. If a cloth, have it clean and sweet, and flour bountifully on the inside. In all, leave room for batter, bread, rice, and cracker puddings to swell. Tie the string very tightly about the mouth of the bag, which must be made with 
<emph rend="italic">felled</emph> seams at sides and bottom, the better to exclude the <ingredient>water.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
The <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be boiling when the pudding goes in, and not stop boiling for one instant until it is done. If it is in a bag, this must be turned several times, 
<emph rend="italic">under <ingredient>water</ingredient></emph>, to prevent sticking or scorching to the sides of the pot. The bag must also be entirely covered, while the <ingredient>water</ingredient> should not quite reach to the top of a mould. If you use a basin, dip the cloth in <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> before dredging with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the inside.
</p>
<p>
When the time is up, take mould, basin, or cloth from the boiling pot, and plunge 
<emph rend="italic">instantly</emph> into <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> then, turn out without the loss of a second. This will prevent sticking, and leave a clearer impression of the mould upon the contents.
</p>
<p>
Boiled puddings should be served as soon as they are done, as they soon become heavy.
</p>
<p>
Many of the baked puddings I have described are quite as good boiled. As a safe rule, 
<emph rend="italic">double the time of baking if you boil</emph>.

<p>
Have plenty of nice sweet lard in which to fry fritters, and test the heat by dropping in a teaspoonful before you risk more. If right, the batter will rise quickly to the surface in a puff-ball, spluttering and dancing, and will speedily assume a rich golden brown. Take up, as soon as done, with a skimmer, shaking it to dislodge any drops of lard that may adhere; pile in a hot dish, sift sugar over them, and send instantly to the table. Fry as many at a time as the kettle will hold, and send in hot fresh ones while the batter lasts. A round-bottomed saucepan or kettle, rather wide at top, is best for frying them.
</p>
<p>
Use a frying-pan for pancakes; heat it; put in a tea-spoonful or two of lard and run it quickly over the bottom; then pour in a large ladleful of batter-enough to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin sheet. Turn with a tin spatula, very carefully, to avoid tearing it. The frying-pan should be a small one. Have ready a hot dish; turnout the pancake upon, it, cover with powdered sugar, and roll up dexterously like a sheet of paper. Send half a dozen to table at once, keeping them hot by setting the dish in the oven until enough are baked.
</p>
<p>
I am thus explicit in these general instructions to save myself the trouble, and the reader the tedium, of a repetition under each receipt.
</p>
<p>
In olden times it was a boast of notable cooks that they could toss a pancake from the pan out of the top of the chimney with such accuracy of calculation, that it would turn itself on the way back, and settle in its place, ready, like St. Lawrence, to have the other side fried. 
<emph rend="italic">I</emph> never saw a pancake tossed, although in my childish days I saw hundreds fried by the honorable tribe--now so fast passing away--of Old Virginia cooks, I do not advise this acrobatic

<hd align="center">CUSTARDS, BLANC-MANGE, JELLIES, AND CREAMS.</hd>
<p>
A good rule for custard is five eggs to a quart of milk, and a tablespoonful of sugar to each egg, although a. good plain custard can be made with an egg for each cup of milk and four tablespoonfuls of sugar to the quart. Creams and custards that are to be frozen must have at least one-third more sugar than those which are not to undergo this process.
</p>
<p>
In heating the milk for custard, do not let it quite boil before adding the yolks. My plan, which has proved a safe one thus far, is to take the scalding milk from the fire, and instead of pouring the beaten eggs into it, to put a spoonful or two of the milk to 
<emph rend="italic">them,</emph> beating well all the while, adding more and more <ingredient>milk</ingredient> as I mix until there is no longer danger of sudden curdling. Then, return all to the fire and boil gently until the mixture is of the right consistency. From ten to fifteen minutes should thicken a quart. Stir constantly.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Always boil <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and custard in a vessel set within another of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient></emph> If you have not a custard or <ingredient>farina</ingredient> kettle, improvise one by setting a tin pail inside of a pot of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> taking care it does not <ingredient>float,</ingredient> also that the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is not so deep as to bubble over the top. Custards are better and lighter if the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and <ingredient>whites</ingredient> are beaten separately, the latter stirred in at the last.

I have forgotten the patentee's name, and perhaps this is well for him, since truth would oblige me to record an unlucky habit his machine had of getting out of order just when I wanted it to do its best. My earliest recollections of ice-cream are of the discordant grinding of the well-worn freezer among the blocks of ice packed about it-a monotone of misery, that, had it been unrelieved by agreeable associations of the good to which it
<pb n="444" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=442"/>
was "leading up," would not have been tolerated out of Bedlam. For one, two, three, sometimes four hours, it went on without other variety than the harsher sounds of the fresh ice and the rattling "swash" as the freezer plunged amid the icy brine when these were nearly melted; without cessation save when the unhappy operator nodded over his work, or was relieved by another predestined victim of luxury and ennui-a battalion of the laziest juveniles upon the place being detailed for this purpose. I verily believed in those days that the freezing could not be facilitated by energetic action, and used to think how fortunate it was that small darkeys had a predilection for this drowsy employment. 1 shall never forget my amazement at seeing a brisk Yankee housewife lay hold of the handle of the ponderous tin cylinder, and whirl it with such will and celerity, back and forth, back and forth, that the desired end came to pass in three-quarters of an hour.
</p>
<p>
That day has gone by. Time has grown too precious now even to juvenile contrabands for them to sit half the day shaking a freezer under the locust-trees on the old plantation lawn. Machines that will do the work in one-tenth of the time, with one-fiftieth of the labor, are sold at every corner. But, so far as I know, it was reserved for a nice old lady up in the "Jersey" mountains-the tidiest, thriftiest, most cheerful bee I ever knew-to show her neighbors and acquaintances that ice-cream could be made to freeze itself. For five or six years I have practised her method, with such thankfulness to her, and such satisfaction to my guests and family, that I eagerly embrace the opportunity of circulating the good news.

Pour the hot <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to this, little by little, beating all the while; put in the frothed <ingredient>whites,</ingredient> and return to the fire-boiling in a pail or saucepan set within one of <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient> Stir the mixture steadily about fifteen minutes, or until it is thick as <ingredient>boiled custard.</ingredient> Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. When quite cold, beat in the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and the flavoring unless you have used the <ingredient>bean.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Have ready a quantity of ice, cracked in pieces not larger than a <ingredient>pigeon egg</ingredient>-the smaller the better. You can manage this easily by laying a great lump of ice between two folds of coarse sacking or an old carpet, tucking it in snugly, and battering it, through the cloth, with a sledge-hammer or mallet until fine enough. There is no waste of ice, nor need you take it in your hands at all-only gather up the corners of the carpet or cloth, and slide as much us you want into the outer vessel. Use an ordinary old-fashioned upright freezer, set in a deep pail; pack around it closely, first, a layer of pounded ice, then one of <ingredient>rock salt</ingredient>-<emph rend="italic">common, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will not do</emph>. In this order fill the pail; but before covering the freezer-lid, remove it carefully that none of the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> may get in, and, with a long wooden ladle or flat stick (I had one made on purpose), beat the custard as you would batter, for five minutes, without stay or stint. Replace the lid, pack the ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> upon it, patting it down <ingredient>hard</ingredient> on top; cover all with several folds of blanket or carpet, and leave it for one hour. Then remove the cover of the freezer when
<pb n="446" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=444"/>
you have wiped it carefully outside. You will find within a thick coating of frozen custard upon the bottom and sides. Dislodge this with your ladle, which should be thin at the lower end, or with a long carving-knife, working every particle of it clear. Beat again <ingredient>hard</ingredient> and long until the custard is a smooth, half-congealed <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> The smoothness of the ice-cream depends upon your action at this juncture. Put on the cover, pack in more ice and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and turn off the <ingredient>brine.</ingredient> Spread the double carpet over all once more, having buried the freezer out of sight in ice, and leave it for three or four hours. Then, if the wafer has accumulated in such quantity as to buoy up the freezer, pour it off, fill up with ice and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> but do not open the freezer. In two hours more you may take it from the ice, open it, wrap a towel, wrung out in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> about the lower part, and turn out a solid column of <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> firm, close-grained, and smooth as velvet to the <ingredient>tongue.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Should the ice melt very fast, you may have to turn off the <ingredient>water</ingredient> more than twice; but this will seldom happen except in very hot weather. You need not devote fifteen minutes in all to the business after the custard is made. You may go into the cellar before breakfast, having made the custard overnight, stir in the cold <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and flavoring, get it into the freezer and comfortably packed down before John is through shaving, and by choosing the times for your stolen visits to the lower regions, surprise him and the children at a one-o'clock dinner by the most delicious dessert in the world. I have often laughed in my sleeve at seeing 
<emph rend="italic">my </emph>John walk through the cellar in search of some mislaid basket or box, whistling carelessly, without a suspicion that his favorite delicacy was coolly working out its own solidification tinder the inverted barrel on which I chanced to be leaning at his entrance.

If you cannot get dry <ingredient>rock salt,</ingredient> that which settles at the bottom of <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-barrels will do as well. Keep the freezer hidden, from first to last, by the ice heaped over it, except when you have to lift the lid on the occasions I have specified.

<p>
Use none but porcelain, or 
<emph rend="italic">good </emph>bell-metal kettles for <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> and <ingredient>jellies.</ingredient> If the latter, clean thoroughly just before you put in the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> or <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> Scour with sand, then set it over the fire, with a cupful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and a large handful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in it. Let this come to a boil, and scour the whole of the inside of the kettle with it. Do not let your <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> or anything else stand one moment in it after it is withdrawn from the fire; fill the emptied kettle instantly with <ingredient>water</ingredient> and wash it perfectly clean, although you may mean to return the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> to it again in five minutes. By observing these precautions, <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> and <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> made in
<pb n="457" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=455"/>
bell-metal may be rendered as good and wholesome as if the frailer porcelain be used.
</p>
<p>
Use only fine <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> for nice <ingredient>preserves.</ingredient> Moist or dark <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> cannot be made to produce the same effect as dry <ingredient>white.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Do not hurry any needful step in the process of preserving. Prepare your <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> with care, weigh accurately, and allow time enough to do your work well. Put up the <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> in small jars in preference to large, and, when once made, keep them in a cool, dark closet that is perfectly dry. Keep <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> in small stone china jars, or glass tumblers closely covered. You can procure at most china and glass stores, or house-furnishing establishments, metal covers with elastic rims for these, which can be used from year to year.
</p>
<p>
Cover <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> and jams with tissue <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> double and wet with <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> pressed closely to the conserve before you put on the lid, or <ingredient>paste</ingredient> on the thick <ingredient>paper.</ingredient> Examine your shelves frequently and narrowly for a few weeks to see if your <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> are keeping well. If there is the least sign of fermentation, boil them over, adding more <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
If <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> are not so firm after six or eight hours as you would have them, set them in the sun, with bits of window glass over them to keep out the dust and insects. Remove these at night and wipe off the moisture collected on the under side. Repeat this every day until the <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> shrinks into firmness, filling up one cup from another as need re-quires. This method is far preferable to boiling down, which both injures the flavor and darkens the <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient>

<hd align="center" size="larger">CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>
Within a few years canned fruits have, in a great measure, superseded preserves. They are cheaper, more wholesome, and far less difficult to prepare. Attention to
<pb n="474" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=472"/>
a few general rules will insure success to every housekeeper who sensibly prefers to put up her own season's supply of these to purchasing those for double the cost, which are not nearly so good.
</p>
<p>
First, examine cans and elastics narrowly before you begin operations. See that the screw is in order, the can without crack or nick, the elastic firm and closely fitting.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, have the fruit boiling hot when sealed. Have upon, the range or stove a pan in which each empty can is set to be filled after it is rolled in hot water. Lay elastic and top close to your hand, fill the can to overflowing, re membering that the fruit will shrink as it cools, and that a vacuum invites the air to enter; clap on the top without the loss of a second, screw as tightly as you can, and as the contents and the can cool, screw again and again to fit the contraction of metal and glass.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, if you use glass cans (and they are cheapest in the end, for you can use them year after year, getting new elastics when you need them) keep them in a cool, dark place, and dry as well as cool. The light will cause them to fer-ment, and also change the color.

It will only increase the number of cans to be filled, without real advantage to you.

<p>
Use none but the best cider vinegar; especially avoid the sharp colorless liquid sold under that name. It is weak sulphuric acid, warranted to riddle the coat of any stomach, even that of an ostrich, if that bird were so bereft of the instinct of self-preservation as to make a lunch of bright-green cucumber-pickle seven times a week.
</p>
<p>
If you boil pickles in bell-metal, do not let them stand in it one moment when it is off the fire; and see for yourself that it is perfectly clean and newly scoured before the vinegar is put in.
</p>
<p>
Keep pickles in glass or hard stoneware; look them over every month; remove the soft ones, and if there are several of these, drain off and scald the vinegar, adding a cup of sugar for each gallon, and pour hot over the pickles. If they are keeping well, throw in a liberal handful of sugar for every gallon, and tie them up again. This tends to preserve them, and mellows the sharpness of the vinegar. This does not apply to 
<emph rend="italic">sweet</emph> <ingredient>pickle.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Pickle,</ingredient> well made, is better when a year old than at the and of six months. I have eaten <ingredient>walnut pickle</ingredient> ten years old that was very fine.
</p>
<p>
Keep your <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> well covered with <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient>

<p>
If you use ground <ingredient>spices,</ingredient> tie them up in thin muslin bags.

Cover with a stoneware or wooden top; tie stout cloth over this, and keep in a cool, dry place. They will be ready for eating in two months. Examine every few weeks.

<p>
Never buy ground coffee if you can get any other. The mere fact that after they have gone to the expense of the machinery and labor requisite for grinding it, the manufacturers can sell it cheaper per pound than grocers can the whole grains, roasted or raw, should convince every sensible person that it is adulterated with other and less expensive
<pb n="492" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=490"/>
substances. Be that as it may, coffee loses its aroma so rapidly after it is ground that it is worth your while to buy it whole, either in small quantities freshly roasted, or raw, and roast it yourself. You can roast in a pan in the oven, stirring every few minutes, or in the same upon the top of the range. Stir often and roast quickly to a bright brown-not a dull black. While still hot, beat up the white of an egg with a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir up well with it. This will tend to preserve the flavor. Grind just enough at a time for a single making.

If the Maltese cross appears but seldom in the section devoted to drinks, it is because most of my information respecting their manufacture is second-hand. In my own family they are so little used, except in sickness, that I should not dare to teach others, upon my own authority, how to prepare them. Indeed, the temptation I felt to omit many of them reminded me of a remark made, introductory of <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> by one of the "Complete Housewives," who, all five together, drove me to the verge of an attack of congestion of the <ingredient>brain,</ingredient> before I had been a housekeeper for a week. Said this judicious lady:-" <ingredient>Preserves</ingredient> of all kinds are expensive and indigestible, and therefore poisonous. 
<emph rend="italic">Therefore</emph>"-again-" I shall not give directions for their manufacture, except to remark that barberries stewed in <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> are economical, and a degree less hurtful than most others of that class of compounds."
</p>
<p>
Then I reflected that I might, upon the same principle, exclude all receipts in which <ingredient>cocoanut</ingredient> is used, because it is rank poison to me; while a dear friend of mine would as soon touch arsenic as an <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> A large majority of the beverages I have named are highly medicinal, and deserve a place in the housekeeper's calendar on that account. Many, so far from being hurtful, are beneficial to a weak stomach or a system suffering under general debility. 
<emph rend="italic">None which contain <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> in any shops should be used daity, much less semi- or tri-daily by a well person</emph>.

This principle reduced to practice would prove the preventive ounce which would cure, all over the land, the need for Temperance Societies and Inebriate Asylums.

The sick-chamber should be the most quiet and cheerful in the house-a sacred isle past which the waves of domestic toil and solicitude glide silently. This is not an easy rule to obey. Whoever the invalid may be, whether the mother, father, or the sweet youngling of the flock, the foundations of the household seem thrown out of course while the sickness lasts. You may have good servants and kind friends to aid you, but the hitch in the machinery is not to be smoothed out by their efforts. The irregularity does not annoy you ; you do not notice it if the attack bo severe or dangerous. All other thoughts are swallowed up in the all-absorbing ever-present alarm. You count nothing an inconvenience that can bring present relief, or possible healing to the beloved one; disdain for yourself rest or ease while the shadow hangs above the pillow crushed by the helpless head. But when it passes, when the first transport of thankfulness has subsided into an abiding sense of safety, the mind swings back to the accustomed pivot, and your eyes seem to be suddenly unbound. You find, with dismay, that the children have run wild, and the comfort of the whole family been neglected during your confinement to the post of most urgent duty; with displeasure, that the servants have, as you consider, taken advantage of your situation to omit this task, and to slur over that;-in fine, that nothing has been done well, and so many things loft altogether undone, that you are "worried out of your mouses"-a phrase that too often signifies, out of your temper.
</p>
<p>
And it is just at this juncture-when you are called to fifty points of attention and labor at once, and are on the verge of despair at the conglomeration worse conglomerated arising before you ; fidgetting to pick up dropped stitches in
<pb n="504" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=502"/>
the web you were wont to keep so even-that the invalid becomes most exacting. "Unreasonable," you name it to yourself, even though it be John himself who calls upon you every third minute for some little office of loving-kindness; "who wants to be amused and fed and petted, and made generally comfortable as if he were a six-months-old baby; who never remembers that you must be wearied out with warning and anxiety, and that everything below-stairs is going to destruction for the want of a balance-wheel. The better he loves you the more apt is he to fancy that nobody but you can do anything for him; the more certain to crave something which no one else knows how to prepare. And when you. have strained muscle and patience a 
<emph rend="italic">little </emph>further to get it ready, and with prudent foresight made enough to last for several meals, it is more than probable that his fickle taste will suggest something entirely different for "next time." "Just for a change, you know, dear. One gets so tired of eating the same thing so often!"
</p>
<p>
He might be more considerate-less childish-you think, turning away that he may not see your change of countenance. When you have taken so much pains to suit him exactly! It is harder yet when he refuses to do more than taste the delicacy you hoped would tempt him.
</p>
<p>
"It is very nice, I suppose, my love," says the poor fellow, with the air of a martyr. "But it does not taste right, somehow. Maybe the children can dispose of it. If I had a <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> ice, or some <ingredient>wine jelly</ingredient> such as my mother used to make, I am sure I could relish it, I always did detest sick peoples' diet!"
</p>
<p>
If he is very much shaken as to nerves, he will be likely to say, " 
<emph rend="italic">messes</emph>."
</p>
<p>
"I am fairly wild!" said a loving wife and mother, and
<pb n="505" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=503"/>
thrifty housekeeper, to me one day, when I called to see her.
</p>
<p>
She had just nursed her husband and three children through the influenza. All had been down with it at once. That form of demoniacal possession is generally conducted upon the wholesale principle. One of her servants had left in disgust at the increased pressure of work; the weather was rainy, blowy, raw; the streets were muddy, and there was no such thing as keeping steps and halls clean, while the four invalids were cross as only toothache or influenza can make human beings.
</p>
<p>
"I am fairly wild!" said the worthy creature, with tears in her eyes. "I cannot snatch a minute, from morning until night, to put things straight, and yet I am almost tired to death! I was saying to myself as you came in, that I wouldn't try any longer. I would just sit still until the dirt was piled up to my chin, and 
<emph rend="italic">then I would get upon the table!</emph>"
</p>
<p>
How often I have thought of her odd speech since I sometimes with a smile-more frequently with a sigh. But with all my pity for the nurse and housekeeper, I cannot conceal from myself-I would not forget, or let you forget for a moment-the truth that the sick one is the greater sufferer. It is never pleasant to be laid upon the shelf. The resting-place-falsely so-called-is hard and narrow and uneven enough, even when the tramp of the outer world does not jar the sore and jaded frame; when there is no apparent need for the sick person to be upon his feet, and for aught that others can see, or he can say, he might just as well stay where he is for a month or two. But when, the rack of pain having been removed, the dulled perceptions of the mind re-awaken to sensitiveness, and there comes to his ear the bugle-call of duty-sharp, imperative;-when every idle moment speaks to him of a slain opportunity,
<pb n="506" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=504"/>
and the no longer strong man shakes his fetters with piteo as cries against fate, do not despise or be impatient with him. He is feverish and inconsiderate and capricious because he is not himself. You see only the poor wreck left by the demon as he tore his way out of him at the Divine command. Gather it up lovingly in your arms, and nurse it back to strength and comeliness. The sick should always be the chief object of thought and care with all in the household. If need be, let the dirt lie chin-deep every-where else, so long as it is kept out of that one room. There be jealous in your care that nothing offends sight and smell.
</p>
<p>
There should be 
<emph rend="italic">no </emph>smell in a sick-chamber. To avoid this, let in the air freely and often. Cologne-water will not dispel a foul odor, while disinfectants are noisome in themselves. Bathe the patient as frequently and thoroughly as prudence will allow, and change his clothing, with the bed-linen, every day. Do not keep the medicines where he can see them, nor ever let him witness the mixing of that which he is to swallow. So soon as his meals are over, remove every vestige of them from the room. Even a soiled spoon, lying on table or bureau, may offend his fastidious appetite. Cover the stand or waiter from which he eats with a spotless napkin, and serve his food in your daintiest ware.
</p>
<p>
My heart softens almost to tearfulness when I recall the hours, clays, weeks, I have myself spent in the chamber of languishing, and the ingenuity of tenderness that, from my babyhood, has striven to cheat the imprisonment of weariness and make me forget pain and uselessness. The pretty surprises daily invented for ray entertainment; the exceeding nicety with which they were set out before me; the loving words that nourished my spirit when the body was faint unto death, these are events, not slight incidents, in
<pb n="507" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=505"/>
the book of memory. When I cease to be grateful for them or to learn from them how to minister unto others of the like consolation, may my heart forget to beat, my right hand lose her cunning!
</p>
<p>
Do not ask your charge what he would like to eat to day. He will, of a surety, sicken with the effort at selection, and say, " Nothing! " But watch attentively for the slightest intimation of a desire for any particular delicacy, and if you are assured that it cannot hurt him, procure it, if you can, without letting him guess at your intention. Feed him lightly and often, never bringing more into his sight than he may safely eat. A big bowl of broth or jelly will either tempt him to imprudence, or discourage him. "Am I to be burdened with all that?" cries the affrighted stomach, and will have none of it. While he is very weak, feed him with your own hand, playfully, as yon would a child, talking cheerily of something besides his food, and coaxing him into taking the needed nutriment as only a "wife and mother can, or as nobody but John could beguile you to effort in the same direction.
</p>
<p>
Study all pleasant and soothing arts to while away the tune, and keep worry of every kind away from him. A trifle at which you can laugh will be a burden to the enfeebled mind and body, and he has nothing to do but lie still and roll it over until it swells into a mountain. When he can be removed without danger let him have his meals in another room, changing the air of each when he is not in it. Every one who has suffered from long sickness knows the peculiar loathing attendant upon the idea that all food is tainted with the atmosphere of the chamber in which it is served, and if eaten in bed, tastes of the mattress and pillows. The room and all in it may be clean, fresh, and sweet, but the fancy cannot be dismissed. And it is to humor than to reason with most sick fancies.
</p>

<p>
A hired nurse is a useful, often a necessary thing, but while you are upon your feet, and mistress of your own house, delegate to no one the precious task of catering for the dear sufferer. It is an art in itself. I hope a practical knowledge of it will be taught in Women's Medical Colleges, when they are an established "institution" with us.
</p>
<p>
I wish it were proper to record here the name of one of the kindest and best family physicians I ever knew, who had charge of my not very firm health during my girlhood. He owed much-I suppose no one ever knew really how much-of his success in his practice to his tact and skill in devising palatable and suitable nourishment for his patients. I well remember the childish, pleasure with which I would hear him say when the violence of the attack had passed- "Now, my dear child, we must begin with kitchen physic!" and the glow of amused expectation with which I used to watch him, as, with an arch show of mystery, he would beckon my mother from the room to receive his "prescription ;" the impatience with which I awaited the result of the conference, and the zest with which I ate whatever he ordered.
</p>
<p>
If I could have persuaded him to manage this department of my work, it would win for me the degree of M.D, with a new meaning-Mistress of Dietetics.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">THE NURSERY.</purpose> </p>
<p>All food intended for infants should be very thoroughly cooked. The numerous varieties of farinaceous substances- biscotine, farina, rice-flour, arrowroot, etc., however nourishing may be their properties when rightly prepared, are harsh and drastic when underdone. Unless you have a nurse whom you know for yourself to be faithful and experienced, always superintend the cooking of baby's food. It can do no harm--it may prevent much--if you examine it every day to see that it is right as to quality and quantity. Do not aim at variety in this branch of your profession. Confine a child under three years of age to a very limited bill of fare. His stomach is too delicate an organ to be tampered with. Let milk--scalded or boiled, as a rule--be the staple, mixed with farina, barley, or something of the sort. Let him munch Graham bread and light crackers freely. Remove far from him hot bread and griddle-cakes.</p>
<pb n="523" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=521"/><p>
When he has cut his carnivorous teeth, Nature says--" This creature wants meat." And Nature's supply is seldom in advance of the demand. If he did not need what the teeth are designed to chew, you may be sure they would not be given him. Grant him the novel food sparingly and with discretion as to kind. Rare beef and well-boiled mutton, tender roast or boiled chicken and turkey are safe. Withhold fried meats of every description. Do not let him touch veal or pork in any shape. Mince the meat very finely to save his digestive apparatus all unnecessary work. Mealy old potatoes<emph rend="italic">--never</emph> new or waxy--young onions, boiled in two waters; fresh asparagus, green peas, and dry sweet potatoes should suffice for vegetables, with, of course, rice and hominy. For dessert, once in a while, a simple custard, a taste of home-made ice-cream, rice and farina puddings, Graham hasty pudding; the inner part of a well-roasted apple, and, in their season, ripe peaches and apples, will not harm him, taken in moderation, if he be well and strong.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Pare the fruit always.</emph> The skin of an apple is as bad for him as a bit of your kid gloves would be; that of a grape more indigestible than sole-leather Raisins--"skins and all"--are unfit for anybody to eat. Pulp and pits, they are poisonous for baby. Ditto, pickles, pastry, and preserves. Ditto, moat kinds of cake and all sorts of fruit puddings.

Give him light suppers, and put him to bed early in a dark room. He will not grow better in a glare of artificial light than will your camellias and azalias.
</p>
<p>
Always see for yourself that his last waking thoughts are pleasant; that he shuts his eyes at peace with the world and in love with you; that his feet are warm, his stomach easy, and his body not overloaded with blankets and quilts; also, that the nursery is clean and freshly aired. These are better prescriptions for sound slumber than all the old

<hd align="center">CHINA AND GLASS.</hd>
<p>
There are few of the minor crooks in the lot of the careful housewife that cause her more anxiety and more discouragement than the attempt to teach domestics how to wash up dishes.
</p>
<pb n="530" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=528"/>
<p>
"I've heard that Mrs. --- is very 
<emph rend="italic">exact</emph> about some things, such as washing up dishes and the likes of that!' said a woman to me, with an affected laugh, having called to apply for the then vacant position of cook in my kitchen. She had high recommendations, a whine engrafted upon her native brogue, and spoke of me in the third person--a trick of cheap (and bogus) gentility that tries my nerves and temper to the very marrow of my spine. "I was a-saying to myself, as I came along, that Mrs.--- must have been 
<emph rend="italic">very</emph> onlucky in her girls if she had to ache them how to wash up dishes. I always thought that was one of the things that came 
<emph rend="italic">kinder nat'ral</emph> to every cook."
</p>
<p>
"Mrs.---'s" experience goes to prove that the wrong way of doing this must "come natural" to the class mentioned, and that Nature is mighty in woman. The fact that the right way is 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> to pile unrinsed dishes and plates in a big pan with a loose bit of soap on top, and pour lukewarm water over all; then with a bit of rag to splash said water over each separately, and make another pile of them upon the kitchen-table, until the last is drawn, reeking with liquid grease, sticky and streaming, from the now filthy puddle of diluted swill; then to rub them lightly and leisurely with one towel--be they many or few--is as difficult of comprehension to the scullionly mind as would be a familiar lecture upon the 
<emph rend="italic">pons asinorum.</emph>
</p>
<p>
Yet the right and only neat method is so simple and easy! Rinse the greasy plates, and whatever is sticky with sugar or other sweet, in hot water and transfer to a larger pan of 
<emph rend="italic">very</emph> hot. Wash glass first; next silver; then china--one article at a time, although you may put several in the pan. Have a mop with a handle; rub upon the soap (over which the water should have been poured) until you have strong suds; wash both sides of plate and saucer, and wipe 
<emph rend="italic">before putting it out of your hand.</emph> Draining leaves
<pb n="531" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=comm&#38;PageNum=529"/>
which can be felt by sensitive finger-tips, if not seen. If china is rough to the touch, it is dirty. Hot, clean suds, a dry, clean towel, and quick wiping leave it bright and shining. Roll your glasses around in the water, filling them as soon as they touch it, and you need never crack one. A lady did once explain the dinginess of her goblets to me by saying that she was "afraid to put them in hot water. It 
<emph rend="italic">rots</emph> glass and makes it so tender! I prefer to have them a little cloudy." This is literally true--that she said it, I mean. Certainly not that a year's soak in hot water could make glass tender.

It is the design to present in this Library a series of works by the host authors of the day, the leading characteristics of which shall be elevation and purity of tone, and entire freedom from every thing in the remotest degree demoralizing. A broad page, large and clear type, will make the succcessive volumes thoroughly readable, and occasionally they will be carefully illustrated.

</p>
<p>
"And now we have from another popular novelist a cookery book, whereof our house-keeper (this literary recorder is not a bachelor) speaks most enthusiastically. She says that simplicity and clearness of expression, accuracy of detail, a regard to economy of material, and certainty of good results, are requisites in a useful receipt-book for the kitchen, and Marion Harland has comprehended all these. That she has by experience proved the unsatisfactor of housekeepers' helps in general is shown by the arrangement of her book. She has appended a star to such recipes as, after having tried them herself, she can recommend as safe and generally simple. Such a directory will be a great help to one who goes to the book for aid in preparing a pleasant and savory meal without much experience in cooking. The language is so simple, find the directions so plain, that a reasonably intelligent cook might avail herself of it to vary her manner of preparing even ordinary dishes. The introduction to the book should be printed as a tract and put in every house. The simple advice for the management of servants, the general directions at the head of each department of cooking, and the excellent pages on the sick-room, make as complete an aid to housekeepers as can well be desired." 
<emph rend="italic">-Harper's Monthly.</emph>
</p>
<p>
"In the hands of the author, whose name is well known in another department of literature, the subject has been treated with thoroughness and skill, showing that a little common sense may be as successful in the concoction of a toothsome viand as in the composition of a romance."<emph rend="italic">-N.Y. Daily Tribune.</emph>

"It inspires us with a great respect for the housewifery of a literary lady, and we cannot err in predicting for it a wide popularity."

<p>
"The recipes are clearly expressed, easy to follow, and not at all expensive. The suggestions about household affairss are chic. On a test comparison with three other cook-books, it comes out ahead upon every count. Beyond this
