<hd align="center">PREFACE<lb/>
TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</hd>
<p>ALMOST every foreigner who visits this country remarks with astonishment the almost universal neglect of that art upon which, more than any thing else, depends the health and comfort of a people; and by many scientific men have most of the prevalent diseases of this country, especially the dyspepsia, been ascribed to the hurried, crude and unwholesome manner in which our food is prepared; of latter years, more attention has been paid to cooking; but the handmaiden of that parent art, confectionary, is still neglected and unknown, yet it is of little less importance than the graver branch referred to. Confectionary is the poetry of epicurism it throws over the heavy enjoyments of the table the relief of a milder indulgence, and dispenses the delights of a lighter and more harmless gratification of the appetite. The dessert, properly prepared, contributes equally to health and comfort; but "got up" as confectionary too often is, it is not only distasteful to a correct palate, but is deleterious and often actually poisonous.</p>
<p>In introducing to the American public the modes by which the table of hospitality may be enriched and 
 
<pb n="iv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=4"/>

adorned, we have consulted every authority, French or English, within our reach; but the basis of our little work is to be found in Read's Confectioner, a late London publication.</p>
<p>Having for many years been connected with the oldest, most extensive and successful confectionary establishment in the country, we have been enabled to make from our own experience many important modifications and to introduce many additional receipts, particularly in relation to the various articles of luxury which the bounty of our soil and climate render almost exclusively American.</p>
<p>The volume has thus been increased in size, and we trust improved in value.</p>
<p>Trusting that our efforts to advance the popular knowledge of the art which has for many years engaged our attention, may meet with approbation, we present the result of our labours to a candid and indulgent public.</p>

<hd align="center">PREFACE<lb/>
TO THE ENGLISH EDITION.</hd>
<p>MUCH as there has been written in Cookery Books on the art of Confectionary, there are few, very few works on the subject now extant which are practically written, and these are difficult to be obtained, even at high prices; and, having been published some years since, they do not contain any of the modern improvements, or articles which have been introduced within these few years. The object of the present Treatise is to supply this deficiency, and to convey instruction in as plain and concise a manner as possible to the inexperienced, or young apprentices, that they may be enabled to learn their business more efficiently than many masters can or will instruct them in it.</p>
<p>The style and character of the present work will be found quite different from anything which has preceded it. In the part relating to Sugar-boiling I have endeavoured to show the causes of the effects which take place at the different stages, with the uses to which each of the processes is applied. The deficiency on Hard Confectionary which occurs in all other works will be found amply supplied in this. In the proportions for medicated lozenges I have preferred those pharmacop&#x0153;ias to those used by the trade, as being more likely to contain the true quantities of the different drugs which should compose them. It is from this source that they were originally derived, as at one time they formed no inconsiderable part of pharmacy; but they are now only made by confectioners.</p>
<p>The Section on Ices I have endeavoured to render as plain and intelligible as possible, and although I have given general as well as definite rules for the mixture of each sort, yet the last cannot at all times be implicitly followed, but must be modified or altered with respect to the flavouring matter so as to suit the taste of the employer or the parties for whom they are intended; this should always be most scrupulously attended to, if it is wished to give satisfaction as no fixed rules can be given which will admit of their being made to please all persons.</p>
<p>The business of confectionary is divided into several branches, some of them being quite distinct and separate from each other. The branch known as Hard Confectionary is literally the whole of the business, according to the strict meaning of the word, which is derived from the French words <emph rend="italic">confitures</emph>--comfits, things crusted 
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=6"/>

over with dry sugar; and <emph rend="italic">confiturier</emph>--confectioner, a maker or seller of comfits or other sweetmeats. The other branches are the Ornamental and Soft Confectionary. The latter relates to everything connected with the oven, or all sorts of cakes and soft biscuits, and more particularly to the preservation of fruits; the other, as the name implies, to every description of ornaments necessary for the decoration of the table. Hard Confectionary still remains a distinct branch or trade of itself; in fact, many persons' sole occupation is the making of lozenges and comfits, termed pan-work. Some also combine with these the different articles connected with sugar-boiling and preserving. The latter are in general blended together, and mostly practised by cooks and pastry-cooks; but the chief business of a confectioner is alone connected with the ornamental department, and everything necessary for the dessert.</p>
<p>I have thought it requisite to mention this specifically, so as to prevent the occurrence of errors which parents and guardians of families often fall into respecting the nature of the business, and also with regard to the capacity of the child which they intend should be brought up to it. I have heard many say, "Never mind; he is a stupid fool, and may do very well to make cakes." If making <emph rend="italic">cakes</emph> were the sole object he would have to accomplish, <emph rend="italic">perhaps he might do</emph> very well; but even this requires more ingenuity than is generally considered; and if the welfare of the child is studied, so as to enable him to obtain his livelihood in a respectable manner, they must find some means of enabling him to acquire a considerable deal more knowledge than is general with a common-place education, to enable him to compete with the talent at present in the labour-market. The person adapted for this business should be neat and cleanly in his habits, of a lively and ingenious mind, have a quick conception of design, a delicate taste, with a general knowledge of architecture, mythology, and the fine arts; for they are as requisite in the construction of a Pi&#232;ce Mont&#233;e, or an allegorical subject to embellish the table, as to an architect or sculptor in the construction of an expensive building or monument. I do not mean to infer that his information must be so extensive, or that he will be required to make the tour of Italy, Rome, and Greece, to study the original masters; but let him take Nature for his guide; and if he possess the rudiments or principles of the art of design, he cannot fail, with a little attention and perseverance, to become an adept in the higher or ornamental branches of his business.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">THE CONFECTIONER.</hd>
<section class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">SECTION I.--CONFECTIONARY.</hd>
<p>AS SUGAR is the basis or ground-work of the confectioner's art, it is essentially necessary that the practitioner should carefully study and observe the difference in its qualities, the changes which it undergoes or effects when combined with other articles in the process of manufacture, and also the different forms which it assumes by itself at various stages. Without this knowledge, a man will never become a thorough and efficient workman, and it can only be acquired by practice and experience.</p>
<p>The first process which it undergoes in the hands of the confectioner, is that of clarification. It is conducted on the same principle as the refining of sugar, although not carried out in every particular.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Clarification of Raw Sugar.</purpose>

--For every six pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> required to be clarified, take one quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the <ingredient>white of an egg,</ingredient> and about half a teacupful of <ingredient>bullock's blood.</ingredient> Less than a pint will be sufficient for 112 pounds; but if a very fine, transparent, and colourless syrup is required, use either <ingredient>charcoal,</ingredient> finely powdered, or <ingredient>ivory black,</ingredient> instead of the blood. Put the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and whisk it to a froth, then add either of the other articles mentioned, and the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> place the pan containing the ingredients on the stove-fire, and stir them well with a <implement>spatula,</implement> until the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is dissolved, and is nearly boiling. When the ebullition commences, throw in a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to check it; this causes the coarser parts to separate more freely, by which means the whole of the impurities attach themselves to the clarifying matter used; continue this for about five minutes, using about one pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to every six pounds of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or more, until you consider the whole of the dross is discharged, and there remains a fine clear syrup. Then place it by the side of the stove, and carefully remove with a <implement>skimmer</implement> the scum which has formed on the top: it may also be taken off as it rises, but I find the best method is to let it remain a short time after it is clarified before it is removed, otherwise, if you take it off as it rises, part of the syrup is also taken with it. When either <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> or black is used, it must be passed through a <implement>filtering-bag</implement> made of thick flannel, in the shape of a cone, having a hoop fastened round the top to keep it extended, and to which strings are sewn that it may be tied or suspended in any convenient manner: what runs out at first will be 
 
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=14"/>

quite black; return this again into the bag, and continue doing so until it runs fine and clear.</p>
<p><variation>If a little <ingredient>lime,</ingredient> about a spoonful, or any other <ingredient>alkali</ingredient> is added to the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> &amp;c., it will neutralize the acid which all raw <ingredient>sugars</ingredient> contain, and they will be found to stand much better after they have been manufactured, by not taking the damp so soon. This is not generally done by the trade, but it will be found beneficial if practised.</variation></p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">To clarify Loaf Sugar.</purpose>

--This is clarified by mixing the <ingredient>whites of eggs</ingredient> with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> without any other assistance, for having been previously refined, it does not require those auxiliaries again to separate the coarser parts, unless it is of an inferior quality, or an extra fine syrup, as for bon-bons and other fancy articles, is required. <variation>When it is necessary to have a very fine sparkling grain, in that case break your lump into small pieces and put it in a <implement>preserving-pan,</implement> with a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to dissolve it, in which has been mixed the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> and <ingredient>powdered charcoal,</ingredient><ref target="n1" height="superscript">*</ref> as for raw sugar, following those instructions already given. After the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has been drained from the bag, pass some <ingredient>water</ingredient> through to take off any which may be left in the <ingredient>charcoal,</ingredient> which you use for dissolving more <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient></variation></p>
<p>The scum should always be reserved, when <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> or black is not used, to mix with the articles of inferior quality.</p>
<p>The best refined loaf sugar should be white, dry, fine, of a brilliant sparkling appearance when broken, and as close in texture as possible. The best sort of brown has a bright, sparkling, and gravelly look. East India sugars appear finer, but to not contain so much saccharine matter, yet they are much used for manufacturing the best sort of common sweetmeats, when clarified, instead of <ingredient>loaf sugar.</ingredient></p>
</recipe>

<ednote>The following note appears at the bottom of page 14 in the original text.</ednote>
<p size="smaller" id="n1">*Charcoal varies in its qualities, according to the wood from which it is prepared. That made from porous woods, such as the willow, alder, &amp;c., is the best for clarifying liquids; animal charcoal, or bone black, is also equally good, on account of its light and porous nature; that made from hard woods is only fit for fuel, as it does not possess the clarifying and decolouring properties like that made from the more soft and porous woods. When newly prepared, or if it has been kept free from air, it has the property of absorbing all putrid gases; "it is also capable of destroying the smell and taste of a variety of animal and vegetable substances, especially of mucilages, oils, and of matter in which extractive abounds; and some articles are said to be even deprived of their characteristic odour, by remaining in contact with it, as valerian, galbanum, balsam of Peru, and musk. The use of charring the interior of <implement>water-casks,</implement> and of wrapping charcoal in cloths that have acquired a bad smell, depend upon this property. None of the fluid menstrua with which we are acquainted have any action whatever, as solvents, upon carbon."--<emph rend="italic">Paris's Pharmacologia.</emph></p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Degrees of boiling Sugar.</emph>--This is the principal point to which the confectioner has to direct his attention; for if he is not expert in this particular, all his other labour and knowledge will be useless: it is 
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=15"/>

the foundation on which he must build to acquire success in his undertakings.</p>
<p>There are seven essential points or degrees in boiling sugar; some authors give thirteen, but many of these are useless, and serve only to show a critical precision in the art, without its being required in practice; however, for exactness, we will admit of nine, viz.--1. Small thread. 2. Large thread. 3. Little pearl. 4. Large pearl. 5. The blow. 6. The feather. 7. Ball. 8. Crack. 9. Caramel. This last degree derives its name from "a Count Albufage Caramel, of Nismes, who discovered this method of boiling sugar."--<emph rend="italic">Gunter's Confectioner.</emph></p>
<p>In describing the process, I shall proceed in a different manner to other writers on the subject, by classing it under different heads, according to the uses to which it is applied.</p>
<subsection class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">SYRUP.</hd>
<p>Under this head are comprised the degrees from the small thread to the large pearl; for at these points the sugar is kept in a divided state, and remains a fluid of an oily consistency. A bottle which holds three ounces of water will contain four ounces of syrup. The method of ascertaining those degrees, according to the usages of the trade, is as follows:--</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="small thread syrup">Small Thread.</alt></purpose>

--Having placed the <ingredient>clarified syrup</ingredient> on the fire, let it boil a little, then dip the top of your finger in the boiling syrup, and on taking it out apply it to the top of your thumb, when, if it has attained the degree, on separating them a small ring will be drawn out a little distance, about as fine as a hair, which will break and resolve itself into a drop on the thumb and finger.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="large thread syrup">Large Thread.</alt></purpose>

--Continue the boiling a little longer, repeat the same operation as before, and a larger string will be drawn.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="little pearl syrup">Little Pearl.</alt></purpose>

--To ascertain this degree, separate the finger from the thumb as before, and a large string may be drawn, which will extend to nearly the distance the fingers may be opened.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="large pearl syrup">Large Pearl.</alt></purpose>

--The finger may now be separated from the thumb to the greatest extent before the thread will break.</p>
</recipe>

</subsection>
<subsection class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">CRYSTALLIZATION.</hd>
<p>This takes the degrees of the blow and feather. The particles of the sugar being now brought together within the sphere of their activity, the attraction of cohesion commences, whereby they attach themselves together and form quadrilateral pyramids with oblong and rectangular bases. This is generally, but improperly, termed candy, thereby confounding it with the degrees at which it grains, also termed candy. This certainly seems "confusion worse confounded;" but if things are called by their proper names, many of those seeming difficulties and technicalities may be avoided which tend only to confuse and embarrass the young practitioner, without gaining any 
 
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=16"/>

desired end or purpose. If it were generally classed into the degrees of crystallization, the true meaning and use would at once be explained and understood by the greatest novice.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>The nature and principle of this operation are these. First, as in the case of syrup (the first four degrees), <emph rend="italic">when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has absorbed as much <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> as it is capable of containing in a cold state,</emph> by continuing the boiling, a further portion of the solvent (<ingredient>water</ingredient>) is evaporated, and <purpose><alt synonym1="to crystallize sugar">sugar</alt></purpose>

remains in excess, which, when exposed to a less degree of heat, separates itself, and forms crystals on the surface and sides of the vessel in which it is contained, and also on anything placed or suspended in it. But if it is exposed too suddenly to the cold, or disturbed in its action by being shaken, or if the boiling has been continued too long, the crystals will form irregularly by the particles being brought in too close contact, and run too hastily together, forming a mass or lump.</p>
<p>To obtain this part in perfection, the boiling should be gradual, and continued no longer than till a few drops let fall on a cold surface show a crystalline appearance, or after being removed from the fire a <emph rend="italic">thin</emph> skin will form on the surface. It should then be taken from the fire and placed in <emph rend="italic">a less hot but not cold</emph> place, and covered or put into a stove or <implement>hot closet</implement> to prevent the access of cold air. A few drops of <ingredient>spirits of wine,</ingredient> added when the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has attained the proper degree, will conduce to a more perfect crystalline form, scarcely attainable by any other means, as it has a great affinity with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> thereby causing the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to separate itself more freely. It must be used with caution, as too much will cause it to grain.</p>
</recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">To ascertain the Degree of the Blow.</emph>--Continue the boiling of the sugar, dip a <implement>skimmer</implement> in it and shake it over the pan, then blow through the holes, and if small bubbles or air-bladders are seen on the other side, it has acquired this degree.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">The Feather.</emph>--Dip the <implement>skimmer</implement> again into the sugar, and blow through the holes as before, and the bubbles will appear larger and stronger. Or if you give the <implement>skimmer</implement> a sudden jerk, so as to throw the sugar from you, when it has acquired the degree, it will appear hanging from the <implement>skimmer</implement> in fine long strings.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<hd align="center">CANDY.</hd>
<p>Sugar, after it has passed the degree of the feather, is of itself naturally inclined to grain, that is to candy, and will form a powder if agitated or stirred: for as the boiling is continued, so is the water evaporated until there is nothing left to hold it in solution: therefore that body being destroyed by heat, which first changed its original form to those we have already enumerated, as this no longer exists with it, it naturally returns to the same state as it was before the solvent was added, which is that of minute crystals or grains, being held together by the attraction of cohesion, unless, as before stated, they are separated by stirring, &amp;c.</p>
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=17"/>

<p>The sugar being evaporated by boiling from the last degree, leaves a thin crust of crystals round the sides of the pan, which shows it has attained the candy height; and this crust must be carefully removed, as it forms, with a damp cloth or sponge, or the whole mass will candy if suffered to remain. To prevent this is the chief desideratum, all further proceedings for which specific rules will be given in their proper places.</p>
<p>The remaining degrees can be ascertained after the following manner:--</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">The Ball.</purpose>

--Provide a jug of clean <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and a piece of round stick. First dip in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then in the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and again in the <ingredient>water;</ingredient><ref target="n2" height="superscript">*</ref> take off the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> which has adhered to it, and endeavour to roll it into a ball between the finger and thumb in the <ingredient>water:</ingredient> when this can be done, it has attained the desired degree. If it forms a large hard ball which will bite hard and adhere to the teeth when eaten, it is then termed the large ball, <emph rend="italic">et contra.</emph></p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">The Crack.</purpose>

--Follow the directions given for the ball. Slip the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> off from the stick, still holding it in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then press it between the finger and thumb; if it breaks short and crisp, with a slight noise, it is at the crack.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Caramel.</purpose>

--To obtain this degree it requires care and attention, and also to be frequently tried, as it passes speedily from the crack to the caramel. Try it as before directed, and let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> be quite cold, or you will be deceived. If on taking it off the stick it snaps like glass, with a loud noise, it has attained the proper degree; it will also, when it arrives at this point, assume a beautiful yellow colour; after this it will speedily burn, taking all the hues from a brown to a black; therefore, to prevent this, dip the bottom of the pan into a pail of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as soon as it comes to caramel, as the heat which is contained in the pan and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is sufficient to advance it one degree; also be careful that the flame of the fire does not ascend round the sides of the pan, which will burn it.</p>
</recipe>

<p>In boiling sugar, keep the top of the pan partially covered from the time it commences boiling until it has attained the ball or crack: the steam which rises, being again thrown on the sides, prevents the formation of the crust or crystals.</p>
<ednote>The following note appears at the bottom of page 14 in the original text.</ednote>
<p size="smaller" id="n2">*This should be performed as speedily as possible.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose><alt synonym1="to prevent boiled sugar from graining">To prevent its graining,</alt></purpose>

add a little of any sort of <ingredient>acid</ingredient> when it is at the crack--a table-spoonful of common <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> four or five drops of <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> or two or three drops of <ingredient>pyroligneous acid:</ingredient> any of these will have the desired effect; this is termed greasing it: but remember that too much acid will also grain it, neither can it be boiled to caramel if there is too much. A little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> added when it first commences boiling will keep it from rising over the pan, and also prevent its graining. About as much <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> as may be laid on a sixpence, and added to seven pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> or equal quantities of <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum</ingredient> in powder, added when 
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=18"/>

it boils, will also keep it from candying. If <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is poured on a slab that is too hot it is very apt to grain; this is frequently the case after several casts have been worked off in rotation; therefore, when you find it inclined to turn, remove it to a cooler spot, if possible, and not handle it any more than is necessary.</p>
</recipe>

<p>Sugar that has been often boiled or warmed is soon acted upon by the atmosphere, whereby it becomes clammy and soon runs, as it is weakened by the action of the fire. Acid causes the same effect.</p>
<p>If it has passed the degree you intended to boil it at, add a little water, and give it another boil.</p>
</subsection>

<section class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">SECTION II.--SYRUPS.</hd>
<p>THESE are either the juices of fruits, or a decoction or infusion of the leaves, flowers, or roots of vegetables, impregnated with a sufficient quantity of sugar for their preservation and retaining them in a liquid state.</p>
<p>A great portion of this class comes more under the notice of the apothecary than the confectioner; but it may now be considered, with lozenges, as a branch of pharmacy in the hands of the latter, the most agreeable of which are now manufactured by him to supply the place of fresh fruits, &amp;c., when out of season, for the making of cooling drinks, ices, &amp;c., for balls and routs.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">General Rules and Observations.</emph>--Two things are essentially necessary to be observed, which are:--the proper methods of making decoctions and infusions. These require some knowledge of the nature and properties of vegetable matter.</p>
<p>The virtues of most plants are extracted by infusion, and this is generally the case with aromatic plants, and those whose properties depend on an essential oil; for, in boiling, the whole of the aroma of the plant is dispersed, and the syrup loses that delicate flavour for which it is prized.</p>
<p>Aromatic herbs, and the leaves of plants in general, yield their virtues most perfectly when moderately dried. Cold water extracts from these in a few hours, the lighter, more fragrant and agreeable parts, and then begins to take up the more ungrateful and grosser. By pouring the same liquor on fresh parcels of the herb, it becomes stronger, richer, thicker, and balsamic.</p>
<p>Those only should be decocted whose principles consist of mucilage, gum, or resin, and require boiling to extract them.</p>
<p>The compact resinous woods, roots and barks, yield their virtues most freely while fresh. Dry, they yield little to cold or moderately warm water, and require it to be boiling. By this process the grosser, more fixed saline and mucilaginous parts are dissolved, the resinous melted out, and the volatile dissipated.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Infusions.</purpose>

--"These are watery solutions of <ingredient>vegetable matter</ingredient> obtained by maceration, either in <ingredient>hot or cold water,</ingredient> with the assistance 
 
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=19"/>

of ebullition. In selecting and conducting the operation, the following general rules should be observed:--</p>
<p>"1st. Infusion should always be preferred before decoction, where the virtues of the vegetable substance reside in volatile oil, or in principles which are easily soluble; whereas, if they depend upon resino-mucilaginous particles, decoction is an indispensible operation.</p>
<p>"2nd. The temperature employed must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, and infusion made with cold is in general more grateful but less active than one made with heat.</p>
<p>"3rd. The duration of the process must likewise be regulated by the nature of the substances; for the infusion will differ according to the time in which the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has been digested on the materials; thus the aroma of the <ingredient>plant</ingredient> is first taken up, then in succession the colouring, astringent, and gummy parts.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Decoctions.</purpose>

--"These are solutions of the active principles of <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> obtained by boiling them in <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>"1st. Those principles only should be decocted whose virtues reside in principles which are soluble in <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>"2nd. If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be an injurious process; and if it consists of extractive matter, long boiling, by favouring its oxidizement, will render it insipid, insoluble, and inert.</p>
<p>"3rd. The substances to be decocted should be previously bruised or sliced, so as to expose an extended surface to the action of the <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>"4th. The substances should be completely covered with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and the vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent as much as possible the access of air; the boiling should be continued without interruption, and gently.</p>
<p>"5th. In compound decoctions, it is sometimes convenient not to put in all the ingredients from the beginning, but in succession, according to their hardness, and the difficulty with which their virtues are extracted; and if any aromatic or other substances containing volatile principles, or oxidizable matter, enter into the composition, the boiling decoction should be simply poured upon them, and covered up until cold.</p>
<p>"6th. The relative proportions of different vegetable substances to the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be regulated by their nature. The following general rule may be admitted. Of <ingredient>roots,</ingredient> <ingredient>barks,</ingredient> or <ingredient>dried woods,</ingredient> from two drachms to six to every pint of <ingredient>water:</ingredient> of <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> or <ingredient>flowers,</ingredient> half that quantity will suffice.</p>
<p>"7th. The decoction ought to be filtered through linen while hot, as important portions of the dissolved matter are frequently deposited on cooling; care must also be taken that the filter is not too fine, for it frequently happens that the virtues of a decoction depend upon the presence of particles in a minutely divided state."--<attribution rend="italic">Paris's Pharmacologia.</attribution></p>

<p>All acid syrups ought to have their full quantity of sugar, so as to 
 
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=20"/>

bring them to a consistence without boiling, because the very action of much heat destroys their acidity, and makes them liable to candy and this more particularly holds good where the infusion or juice, &amp;c. has any fragrancy in flavour, because the volatile oil is dissipated by boiling. The same observation is also applicable to those infusions of flowers which give out their colour, and which is necessary to be retained, such as violets, pinks, &amp;c., as boiling injures them.</p>
<p>Those syrups which are made from decoctions, and do not take a sufficient quantity of sugar to bring them to a due consistence without boiling, require to be clarified so as to render them transparent; but this is often an injury, as the whites of eggs take off some of their chief properties with the scum; therefore, the decoction should first be rendered clear by settling or filtering, and the sugar should be clarified and boiled to the height of the feather or ball before the decoction is added, when it must be reduced to the proper degree.</p>
<p>The best and most general method of making syrups is to add a sufficient quantity of the finest loaf-sugar, in powder, with the juice or infusion, &amp;c., stirring it well until a small portion settles at the bottom, then place the pan in a larger one containing water; this is termed the <implement>bain-marie;</implement> put it on the fire, and the heat of the water as it boils will dissolve the sugar; when this has been thoroughly effected, take it off and let it cool; if more sugar is added than the quantity above named, it will separate in crystals, and not leave sufficient remaining in the syrup for its preservation. (See observations on Sugar-boiling). When cold, put it into small bottles, fill them, cork closely, and keep in a dry cool place. Be particularly careful that no tinned articles are used in the making of syrups from the juice of red fruits, as it will act on the tin and change the colour to a dead blue.</p>

The method of doing this is at present not generally known in the trade, and it is kept by many that are in possession of it as a great secret. A sovereign is often paid for this recipe alone. However great the secret may be considered, it is only returning to the first principle in the manufacture of sugar. When the juice is expressed from the canes, it contains a considerable quantity of oxalic acid, which must be destroyed before it will granulate into sugar: for this purpose <ingredient>lime</ingredient> is employed, which has the desired effect; so will it also in this case, but <ingredient>chalk</ingredient> or <ingredient>whitening</ingredient> is most generally used. First dissolve your <ingredient>acid sugar</ingredient> in <ingredient>water;</ingredient> when this is thoroughly accomplished, mix in a sufficient quantity of either of these alkalies in powder to cause a strong effervescence; after it has subsided, pass it through a flannel bag, according to the directions for clarifying sugar. The filtered syrup will be fit to use for any purpose, and may be boiled again to the crack or caramel degrees as well as if no acid had ever been mixed with it.

<hd align="center">SECTION VI.--CHOCOLATE.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Cacao Nuts.</emph>--The cocoa or cacao nut, of which chocolate is made, is the seed of the fruit of a tree common in South America and the West Indies. The seeds of the nuts, which are nearly of the shape of an almond, are found to the number of from thirty to forty in a pod. The pods are oval, resembling a cucumber in shape. The different sorts are distinguished by name, according to the places which produce them, thus,--the cacao of Cayenne, Caraccas, Berbice, and the islands of St. Magdalen and Domingo. These all differ in the size of their almonds or seed, quality and taste. The most esteemed is the large Caraccas, the almond of which, though somewhat flat, resembles the shape of a large bean. The next are those of St. Magdalen and Berbice. The seeds of these are less flat than those of the Caraccas kind, and the skin is covered with a fine ash-coloured dust. The others are very crude and oily, and only fit to make the butter of cacao. The kernels, when fresh, are bitter, and are deprived of this by being buried in the ground for thirty or forty days. Good nuts should have a thin brittle skin, of a dark black colour; and the kernel, when the skin is taken off, should appear full and shining, of a dusky colour, with a reddish shade. Choose the freshest, not worm-eaten, or mouldy on the inside, which it is subject to be.</p>
<p>Equal parts of the cacao of Caraccas, St. Magdalen, and Berbice, mixed together, make a chocolate of first-rate quality; and these proportions give to it that rich and oily taste which it ought to have. That made from the cacao of Caraccas only is too dry, and that from the islands too fat and crude.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="roasting cacao nuts">Roasting.</alt></purpose>

--Take a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> to cover the bottom of an iron pot two or three inches deep, place them on the fire to roast, stirring them constantly with the <implement>spatula</implement> that the heat may be imparted to them equally. A <implement>coffee-roasting machine</implement> would answer for this purpose admirably, taking care not to torrefy them too much, as the oil of the nut suffers thereby, and it becomes a dark brown or black, grows bitter, and spoils the colour of the chocolate. Musty or mouldy <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> must be roasted more than the others, so as to deprive them of their bad taste and smell. It is only necessary to heat them until the skin will separate from the kernel on being pressed between the fingers. Remove them from the fire, and separate the skins. If you have a large quantity, this may be accomplished by putting them in a sieve which has the holes rather large, but not so much as to allow the <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> to pass through; then squeeze or press them in your hands, and the skins will pass through the meshes of the sieve; or, after being separated from the <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> they may be got rid of by winnowing or fanning them in a similar manner to corn. When they are separated, put them again in the fire, as before directed, stirring them constantly until warmed through, without browning. You may know when they are heated enough by the outside appearing shiny

again winnow, to separate any burnt skin which may have escaped the first time.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">The Making of Chocolate.</purpose>

--An iron <implement>pestle</implement> and <implement>mortar</implement> is requisite for this purpose, also a stone of the closest grain and texture which can be procured, and a rolling-pin made of the same material, or of iron. The stone must be fixed in such a manner that it may be heated from below with a pot of burning charcoal, or something similar.</p>
<p>Warm the <implement>mortar</implement> and <implement>pestle</implement> by placing them on a stove, or by means of charcoal, until they are so hot that you can scarcely bear your hand against them. Wipe the <implement>mortar</implement> out clean, and put any convenient quantity of your prepared <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> in it, which you pound until they are reduced to an oily paste into which the <implement>pestle</implement> will sink by its own weight. If it is required sweet, add about one-half, or two-thirds of its weight of <ingredient>loaf sugar</ingredient> in powder; again pound it so as to mix it well together, then put it in a pan, and place it in the stove to keep warm. Take a portion of it and roll or grind it well on the slab with the roller (both being previously heated like the <implement>mortar</implement>) until it is reduced to a smooth impalpable paste, which will melt in the mouth like butter. When this is accomplished, put it in another pan, and keep it warm until the whole is similarly disposed of; then place it again on the stone, which must not be quite so warm as previously, work it over again, and divide it into pieces of two, four, eight, or sixteen ounces each, which you put in moulds. Give it a shake, and the chocolate will become flat. When cold it will easily turn out.</p>
<p>The moulds for chocolate may either be made of tin or copper, and of different devices, such as men, animals, fish, culinary or other utensils, &amp;c.; also some square ones for half-pound cakes, having divisions on the bottom which are <alt synonym1="relieved.">relievoed.</alt> These cause the hollow impressions on the cakes.</p>
<p>The Bayonne or Spanish chocolate is in general the most esteemed. The reason of its superior quality is attributed by some to the hardness of the Pyrenean stone which they employ in making it, which does not absorb the oil from the <ingredient>nuts.</ingredient> They do not use any <implement>pestle</implement> and <implement>mortar,</implement> but levigate their <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> on the stone, which is fixed on a slope; and in the second pounding or rolling the paste is pressed closely on the stone, so as to extract the oil, which runs into a pan containing the quantity of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> intended to be used, and is placed underneath to receive it; the <ingredient>oil of the cacao</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> are then well mixed together with a <implement>spatula,</implement> again mixed with the paste on the stone, and finished.</p>

Place them on sheets of white paper about an inch apart. When the sheet is covered, take it by the corners and lift it up and down, letting it touch the table each time, which will flatten them. Cover the surface entirely with white <ingredient>nonpareils,</ingredient> and shake off the surplus ones. When the drops are cold they can be taken off the paper easily. The bottom of the drops should be about as broad as a sixpence. Some of them may be left quite plain.</p>
</recipe>

<p>Good chocolate should be of a clear red brown. As the colour is paler or darker, so is the article the more or less good. The surface should be smooth and shining. If this gloss comes off by touching, it indicates an inferior quality, and is probably adulterated. When broken, it ought to be compact and close, and not appear crumbly. It should melt gently in the mouth when eaten, leaving no roughness or astringency, but rather a cooling sensation on the tongue. The latter is a certain sign of its being genuine.</p>

<p>A <implement>COPPER comfit-pan</implement> is requisite for this purpose. A bar, having chains at each end, with a hook and swivel in the centre, is attached to it, by which it is suspended from the ceiling or a beam, so as to hang about as high as the breast over a stove or charcoal fire, that the pan may be kept at a moderate heat and at such a distance as to allow it to be swung backwards and forwards without touching the fire or stove. A <implement>preserving-pan,</implement> containing clarified syrup, must be placed by the side of the stove, or over another fire, that it may be kept hot, but not boiling; also a ladle for throwing the syrup into the pan, and a <implement>pearling cot.</implement> This last somewhat resembles a funnel, without the pipe or tube, and having a small hole in the centre with a pointed piece of stick or <implement>spigot</implement> fitted into it, which, being drawn out a little, allows the syrup when placed in it to run out in a small stream. A piece of string tied several times across the centre of the top of the cot, and twisted with the <implement>spigot,</implement> allows it to be drawn out and regulated at pleasure.</p>

--Sift two pounds of <ingredient>seeds</ingredient> in a <implement>hair sieve</implement> to free them from dust, put them into the <implement>comfit-pan,</implement> and rub them well about the bottom with your hand until they are quite warm; have some <ingredient>clarified loaf sugar in syrup</ingredient> and boiled to the small thread; give them a charge by pouring over them about two table-spoonfuls to commence with; rub and shake them well about the pan, that they may take the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> equally, until they are quite dry. Be careful in not making them too wet in the first charges by using too much <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> or they will lie of a lump and get doubled, and you will have difficulty in parting them. It will prevent their sticking together if the hand is passed through them between every swing of the pan, and also add to their smoothness. Do not let the heat under the pan be too strong, or it will spoil their whiteness. Give them four or five charges, increasing the quantity of <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> a little each time, and let each charge be well dried before another is given, dusting them at the last charge with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Sift them in a <implement>hair sieve,</implement> and clean the pan. Put them in again, and give them four or five charges more, with a dust of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> at the last; then sift them and clean the pan. Proceed in this manner until they are one-third of the required size. Put them into the stove or sun to dry until the next day, then clarify and boil some <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to the large thread, keep it warm as before, divide the comfits, and put part of them in the pan, so as not to have too many at one time, for as they increase in size you must divide them into convenient portions, so that you may be enabled to work them properly without encumbering the pan. Give them four or five charges of <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> proceeding in the same manner as before, until they 
 
<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=45"/>

are two-thirds or more of the required size, and stove them until the next day. Continue in this manner with each portion alternately, until they are all done. On the third day, boil the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> to the small pearl, and give eight or ten charges as before, without using <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> so as to finish them, lessening the quantity of <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> each time. Swing the pan gently, and dry each charge well. Put them in the stove for half an hour or an hour after each charge, and proceed alternately with each portion until they are finished, when they should be about the size of peas. Put them in the stove for a day, then smooth them with the whitest <ingredient>loaf sugar in syrup,</ingredient> boiled to the small thread; add two or three table-spoonfuls of dissolved <ingredient>gum Arabic</ingredient> with it to give them a gloss. Give three or four charges with a very gentle heat, the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> being cold and the pan scarcely warm. Work and dry each charge well before another is added: when finished, dry them in a moderate heat. It is the best way, if possible, to dry comfits in the sun, as it bleaches them. If the stove is at a greater heat than the sun in a moderately warm day, which is from 70 to 80 degrees of Fahrenheit, it will spoil their whiteness.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Cinnamon Comfits.</purpose>

--<ingredient>Cinnamon</ingredient> is the bark of a tree, of which there are two sorts. The inferior quality is that usually sold for <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> and is otherwise known as cassia, or <emph rend="italic">cassia lignea.</emph> This breaks short, and has a slimy mucilaginous taste, is thicker, and of a darker colour than the <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> which is the inner bark. This breaks shivery, and has a warm aromatic taste, and is of a reddish colour.</p>
<p>Take one pound of <ingredient>cinnamon bark,</ingredient> and steep it in <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a few hours to soften it; cut it into small pieces about half an inch long, and the size of a large needle. Dry it in the stove. Put your pieces, when dry, into the <implement>comfit-pan,</implement> and pour on them a little <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> as for Scotch caraways, proceeding in the same way until they are one-third the required size. You must not use your hand for these as you would for caraways, as they are liable to break in two. Dry them in the stove, then suspend the <implement>pearling pot or cot</implement> from the bar of the pan or ceiling, so as to hang over the centre of the pan; boil some <ingredient>clarified loaf sugar</ingredient> to the large pearl, and fill the cot; put some of the prepared comfits in the pan, but not too many at a time, as it 
 
<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=46"/>

is difficult to get them to pearl alike. Keep the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> at the boiling point: open the spigot of the <implement>cot</implement> so as to allow it to run in a very small stream, or more like a continued dropping; swing the pan backwards and forwards gently, and keep a stronger fire under the pan than otherwise. Be careful that the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> does not run too fast, and wet them too much, but so that it dries as soon as dropped, which causes them to appear rough. If one cot full of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is not enough, put in more until they are the required size. When one lot is finished put in sieves to dry, and proceed to another; but do not let them lie in the pan after you have finished shaking them. They will be whiter and better if partly pearled one day and finished the next. Use the best <ingredient>clarified sugar</ingredient> to finish them.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XI.--MARMALADES OR JAMS.</hd>
<p>MARMALADE is generally a term applied to a preserve made either of oranges, lemons, apples, pears, quinces, or plums; but I know no difference between marmalades and jams, as they are each of them the pulp of fruits reduced to a consistence, with sugar, by being boiled. If it contains too much sugar it will crystallize, or what is termed candy. The top and sides of the vessel which contains it will be covered with a thin coating of sugar; and if there is not enough in it, or it is not sufficiently boiled, it will soon ferment. Keep them in a cool dry place.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XIII.--FRUITS PRESERVED WITH SUGAR.</hd>
<p><emph rend="bold">WET FRUITS.</emph>--Most of the fruits are first prepared by being blanched, that is, boiled in water; they are then drained and put into boiling syrup, where they remain for a day. The syrup being now weakened with the juice of the fruit, it is poured off, more sugar is added, and it is reduced again to syrup by boiling, and poured hot over the fruit: this is continued until it is fully saturated with sugar, which may be known by the syrup being no longer weakened with the juice of the fruit. Keep them in a dry but not warm place, as too much heat will cause them to ferment, more especially if they are not fully incorporated with sugar; nor in a damp place, or they will become mouldy.</p>
<p>All green fruits require to be greened, so as to bring them to their original colour, for in blanching they assume a yellowish cast: this is probably occasioned by a portion of the alkali being extracted in the 
 
<pb n="57" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=57"/>

boiling. The green colour of fruits and leaves depends upon an excess of alkali; and in proportion as acid or alkali prevails in them, so are they coloured from red to violet, blue, and green; therefore if alkali is added to the water, the colour is retained. This is exemplified in the everyday domestic duties of the cook, who uses soda, potash, or muriate of soda (common salt), in boiling her greens or cabbages. I have here stated the principle on which their colour depends, to show that there is no necessity for green fruits being kept for some time in brass or copper pans, whereby they take up a portion of verdigris, which often proves injurious.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XVI.--ON BOTTLED FRUITS, OR FRUITS PRESERVED WITHOUT SUGAR.</hd>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p>CHOOSE wide-mouthed bottles, which are made for this purpose, let them be clean and perfectly dry; gather the <purpose><alt synonym1="bottled fruit">fruit</alt></purpose>

during dry weather, and fill the bottles if possible on the same day; shake the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> well down by knocking the bottom edge of the bottle on the table; prepare some corks or bungs (which are made for fruit bottles by being cut the contrary way of the grain); pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over them, which will deprive them of any smell or dirt; repeat this a second time, if necessary, letting them remain in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> each time until it is cold; cork the bottles well, and tie them over with wire or string. <variation><attribution>M. Appert</attribution> recommends that they should be luted with a mixture made of <ingredient>fresh slaked lime</ingredient> and <ingredient>soft cheese;</ingredient> this is to be spread on rags and tied over the mouth of the bottle; they are then placed in a <implement>boiler</implement> and <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as far as their mouths; a cover is put on with a piece of linen round it to prevent evaporation, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is then heated to boiling, and is kept at this point until it is considered that the fruit is boiled in their own <ingredient>water</ingredient> or juice; the fire is then withdrawn, and they are suffered to remain in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> for an hour, when it may be drawn off.</variation> The method which I in general pursue is to raise the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to the boiling point, and keep it at this heat for about an hour, according to the nature of the fruit; they are then suffered to remain in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> until it is cold. I find this way generally successful. When they are taken out, cover the mouth of the bottle with melted rosin or bottle wax.</p>
<p>This method is much superior to that of preparing them with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which renders the fruit flat, dead, and insipid, the whole of the flavour of the fruit being imparted to the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> except when bottled very green, when it does not lose it so much.</p>
<p><variation>A method I have tried with pretty good success, is to obtain the fruit before it is ripe, bottle it, and fill the bottles with <ingredient>cold spring water,</ingredient> in which are dissolved some <ingredient>oxymuriate of <alt synonym1="potash,">potass,</alt></ingredient> cork them close, and cover the mouths with rosin. <ingredient>Plums</ingredient> done in this way had the natural bloom on them. I found these were better than those done in a similar manner by heat. A few bottles of them fermented. After the fermentation was over I corked them close, and in six months I opened some, when they had a smell like wine, and were not so flat as those which were well preserved by heat, and filled with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> these certainly look well to the eye, but they are only fit to be used for large pies, when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be made into a syrup with <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and put in with it.</variation></p>
<p>The first method, which is the same as Appert's, or nearly so, is decidedly the best; it retains the natural flavour, and may be used for any purpose it is required, it being as good as fresh fruit.</p>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p><purpose><alt synonym1="bottled fruit pulp" synonym2="bottled fruit juice">The pulp or juice of fruits may also be preserved</alt></purpose>

in the same way; if the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is not ripe enough to pulp, put it into a jar, and stop it close, place it in a kettle of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> heat it until it boils, and let it continue at this point for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; take it out and pass the pulp through a <implement>hair-sieve;</implement> bottle, and finish as before.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p>This method of <attribution>M. Appert's</attribution> is not altogether original, but was anticipated by the experiments of Mr. Boyle. A system somewhat on the same principle has been practised by many in the trade for years, which is this. The <purpose><alt synonym1="bottled fruit">fruit</alt></purpose>

is bottled and carefully corked, the bottles are then placed on the top of the oven, where they are suffered to remain for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, according to the temperature, which is generally from 120&#176; to 140&#176; Fahrenheit's thermometer. At one place I ascertained the heat during the process, and it averaged 130&#176;. Another system practised is that of heating the bottles in a cool oven.</p>
</recipe>

<p>The principle endeavoured to be accomplished is to destroy the small portion of oxygen contained in the bottle after being corked, by converting it into carbonic acid gas; but some other unknown agent must be produced, as this may be done without heat, which the fermentation of the fruit would cause by itself; for, according to the experiments of Hildebrand, had the oxygen of the atmosphere remained unaltered, it would have caused putrefaction; for he found that oxygen mixed with a small quantity of azote, promoted putrefaction more than pure oxygen. He found that hydrogen gas was the greatest preservative, nitrous next, and after this carbonic. These experiments were tried on meat, but they may be equally applicable in respect to fruit, when the auxiliary produced by heat is not definitely known.</p>
<p>Fruit should always be bottled and boiled on the same day it is gathered; for the longer the fruit lies together the more it sweats; fermentation commences, which is accelerated in the bottles by heat, and there is great danger of their bursting.</p>
<p>All decayed or bruised fruit should be carefully excluded, and that should be preferred which is not quite ripe.</p>
<p>When finished, the bottle should be kept in a cool dry place.</p>

<p>[THERE is no article of the dessert kind that deserves a more elevated position than well-made ices, as well for their intrinsic merit as for the agreeable <emph rend="italic">go&#251;t</emph> which they impart to a well-got-up entertainment.</p>
<p>Philadelphia has for a long time enjoyed a pre-eminent reputation in the manufacture of these delicious compounds; the rage however for <emph rend="italic">cheap</emph> articles, without a due regard to their merits, has made sad inroads into the business; and, in order to accommodate this spirit of retrenchment, ignorant pretenders have consented to the base practice of making inferior articles, which they palm off on the unwary under the specious guise of economy. With these persons it is a custom to use three-fourths milk and only one-fourth of the legitimate article, cream, and, in order to procure a sufficient body, to intermix boiled flour, arrowroot, or potatoe flour; also to flavour with tartaric acid instead of fresh lemons, tonquin bean instead of vanilla, and inferior fruits when the best only should be used.</p>
<p>We mention these facts in order to caution young beginners against any such fatal mistakes. The best ingredients should <emph rend="italic">always</emph> be used. Obtain your cream invariably fresh from a dairyman who is tenacious of his reputation, and who is known to produce a pure rich article; <emph rend="italic">it cannot be too good,</emph> and if not used immediately should be kept in ice until wanted. Good cream cannot be had (even where large quantities are used) for a less price than twenty cents per quart. Use cream entirely, and on no account mingle the slightest 
 
<pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=70"/>

quantity of milk, which detracts materially from the richness and smoothness of the ices. Always use the finest flavoured to be obtained, and follow implicitly the following very copious directions, and you will be certain to be rewarded by a fine article, of which you may well be proud:]</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Utensils requisite for making.</emph>--1st. Pewter pots of various sizes, suitable to the quantity of mixture intended to be frozen. Tin or zinc will not answer the purpose, as it congeals the mixture too quickly without allowing it a sufficient time to become properly incorporated, and forms it in lumps like hailstones.</p>
<p>2d. Half pint, pint, pint and a half, and quart moulds, and some in the form of fruits made to open in the centre with a hinge: these also require to be made of the same material.</p>
<p>3d. Ice pails. These should be adapted to the size of the pots, about the same depth, and eight or ten inches more in diameter; if about even greater, it is immaterial, the depth being the principal consideration, for the deeper it is the greater caution is required to prevent the salt from entering the mixture; for as the ice dissolves, the pot descends, and the water runs under the cover, which, being salt, spoils the contents; neither have you a sufficient basis whereon the pot rests so as to mix your creams, &amp;c., with the <implement>spatula;</implement> consequently, half your exertions are lost by its constant sinking when you apply the least effort to scrape it from the sides. There should be a hole near the bottom, with a cork fitted into it, so as to be drawn at pleasure, that the water may be allowed to run off when there is too much.</p>
<p>4th. The <implement>spatula.</implement> This is an instrument somewhat resembling a gardener's <implement>spade;</implement> it should be made of stout copper and tinned, the blade being about four inches long by three in width, round at the end, and having a socket to receive a wooden handle; this is for scraping the cream, &amp;c., from the sides of the pot as it freezes, and for mixing it.</p>
<p>5th. Either a large <implement>mortar</implement> and <implement>pestle,</implement> or a strong box and mallet for pounding the ice.</p>
<p>6th. A <implement>spade</implement> wherewith to mix the ice and salt together, fixing your pails, &amp;c.</p>
<p>7th. A tin case or box, with a kind of drawer fitted to it so as to be drawn out at pleasure, and having shelves or divisions; this is for keeping the ices in the form of fruits, after they are finished, until required for the table.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">To freeze Ices.</purpose>

--This is accomplished through the medium of <ingredient>ice.</ingredient> Of itself it does not contain sufficient frigorific power to congeal a liquid body to the required consistence without an auxiliary; the usual one employed is that of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> As a general rule, take about two pounds to every six pounds of ice, which I think will be nearly the quantity required. I cannot state precisely, as it is the custom to mix it by guess; but note, the freezing quality depends on the 
 
<pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=71"/>

quantity of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> which is used, consequently, the more there is mixed with the ice the quicker are the creams, &amp;c., frozen.</p>
<p>Pound a sufficient quantity of ice small, and let some <ingredient>salt</ingredient> be well mixed with it; place the pot containing the mixture in a pail, which you fill (the latter) with pounded ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> as far as the lid; strew a handful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the top of the ice, let it remain a few minutes until you have similarly disposed of others, as three or four may be done at a time if required, then whirl them round briskly by means of the handles for five minutes, take off the lids one at a time, and with the <implement>spatula</implement> stir or carry the unfrozen part well round the sides, turning the pot also with the left hand; continue this for two or three minutes, which serves to soften what has already frozen, as well as helps to freeze the remaining portion; then scrape it from the sides, put on the lids, whirl round again briskly, as before directed, repeating the same operations every four or five minutes. As it forms into consistence, do not spare your labour in well working or mixing it together when you scrape it down, so as to make it perfectly smooth and free from lumps, for the smoothness of your ice depends on this operation; continue to freeze until the whole is well set. Ice when well frozen should be about the consistence of butter, tough to the feel, of a good colour, and without any lumps in it. Those which contain too much <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> cannot be frozen to the degree required, and those which have too little freeze hard, and feel short and crisp, like compressed or frozen snow, which arises from having too many watery particles in it, by the excess of either <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk</ingredient> according to the nature of your ice. In either case it may be ascertained when you commence freezing, by the first coat which is formed round the sides. It should then be altered by either adding more <ingredient>cream</ingredient> or <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with <ingredient>juice, or pulp of fruit,</ingredient> or other <ingredient>flavouring matter</ingredient> in proportion, as the case may be, if too rich, and <emph rend="italic">vice vers&#226;,</emph> by the addition of more syrup, &amp;c., when poor; but at all times the necessity of altering them should be avoided, as the component parts cannot be so perfectly blended together, without considerable extra labour, as if they were properly mixed at the commencement.</p>
<p>During the time of freezing, or after the creams, &amp;c., are moulded and set up, if there is too much <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the pail, the frigorific power is lessened; a little increases it, as at first it is only a solution of the <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> but as the ice dissolves and mixes with it, it decreases; therefore, when it comes to the top drain it off, and fill up with fresh <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice.</p>
<p>When the ices are properly frozen, take out the pots, drain off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> empty the pail, again replace them and fill them with fresh <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice, as before; then spread the creams over the sides of the pot, when they are ready for use, if they are intended to be served in a shop or by glassfulls. Should it be required for moulds, line the bottom with a piece of paper, before you put it on; if there is no impression or figure on the top, you may cover that also with paper; in filling them press it well in, so as to fill every part; leave a little projecting

above the surface to form the top, which you put on; pack the moulds in a pail, and fill the vacancies with pounded ice well mixed with plenty of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> strew a handful also on the top.</p>
<p>Ices should be moulded from half an hour to an hour before they are required to be served.</p>
<p>When you want to turn them out, wash the mould well in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> that no <ingredient>salt</ingredient> may remain on it; take off the bottom and top, and the ice will come out easily.</p>
<p><variation>For <purpose>fruit moulds,</purpose>

fill each with either <ingredient>cream or water ice</ingredient> of the same kind as that which you would represent, and for the better resemblance to nature, preserve the stone with the stalk and leaves of each, which put in their proper places, allowing the leaves to project outside; close the mould, wrap it in paper, and place it in <ingredient>ice</ingredient> as others; when you want to turn them out, wash the shape in <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to take off the paper, and be careful that you do not injure the leaves, as they will often be found frozen to it; dip it again in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> open it and take out the ice, which you colour to nature with <implement>camel's-hair pencils</implement> and <ingredient>liquid colour</ingredient> (see Colours); the down or bloom is represented by dusting it with <ingredient>dry colour</ingredient> in powder, tied in a small thin muslin bag, or by means of a dry <implement>camel's-hair pencil;</implement> line the shelves of the case with paper or vine leaves, and put in the fruit as it is finished; let the case be surrounded with <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as for moulds.</variation></p>

<p>Ices may be divided into three classes, viz: cream, custard, and water. These derive their names from the basis of which they are composed, the flavouring matter mixed with it giving the other definition; thus we say, raspberry cream and raspberry water; but custard ices are not so particularly defined as the others by the basis, and either only receives the name of the flavour given to it, or as that of cream.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Cream Ices.</emph>--These are composed entirely of pure fresh cream, with the juice or pulp of fruit either fresh or preserved, and syrup or sugar so blended together as the taste of one may not predominate over that of another; but if either is in excess it should be that of the fruit.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XX.--ON ESSENCES.</hd>
<p>THE essences or essential oils sold for general use are or ought to be obtained by distillation; but for many purposes they may be obtained equally as good, and, in some cases, superior, without. As these are often adulterated with olive or nut oils, or with spirits of wine, the fixed oils may be detected by pouring some of the suspected essence on a piece of clean writing paper, and holding it before the fire; the quantity of fixed oil it contains will remain, leaving a greasy mark, whereas the pure essential oil will evaporate without leaving any appearance; if spirits of wine be added, pour a little water or oil of turpentine into the adulterated sample, and it will turn milky, as the two will not unite without producing this effect. It is often sophisticated with the oil of turpentine, which is the lightest of all essential oils; in this case, rub a drop over the hand and hold it by the fire, when it may be recognized by the smell, or if burnt it will give out a dense black smoke.</p>
<p>Rectified spirits of wine dissolve the volatile oil and resin of vegetables (their taste and smell most frequently reside in these), whilst water acts on the saline and mucilaginous parts. Proof spirit, which is a mixture of both these, extracts all their virtues, and through this we are enabled to obtain the essence or tincture of any vegetable, of superior quality to that generally sold, and at considerably less expense. The essential oil of lemons or oranges is obtained by rubbing off the yellow rind on the rough surface of a piece of loaf sugar, which is much superior for flavour to that produced by any other means. Scrape off the sugar after it has imbibed the oil, and dry it in a gentle heat, put it into small glazed pots, and tie them over with bladder; it will keep any length of time unimpaired. The same observation holds good as regards all fruit whose flavour or essential oil resides in its peel.</p>

In many establishments, where quantities of peel are thrown away, the cost of this would be comparatively trifling, compared with the price of the inferior oil generally sold.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="cake decoration">On piping Cakes, Bon-bons, &amp;c.</alt></purpose>

--This is a method of ornamenting wedding, twelfth-cakes, and other articles with icing, by means of small pipes or tubes; these are most generally made with writing-paper folded in the form of a cone, in the same manner as a grocer makes up his papers for small lots of sugar, tea, &amp;c. The tube is filled with <ingredient>icing,</ingredient> made as for cakes, the base of the cone, or the place where it was filled, is turned down to prevent the sides opening, and the escape of the icing; the point is then cut off with a sharp knife or scissors, so as to make a hole sufficiently large to form the icing, when squeezed or pressed out, in a thread of the required size, and which will either be fine or coarse according to the length of the point which is cut off. If the hole at the point of the cone is not perfectly straight when the icing is pressed out, it will form a spiral thread, which is very inconvenient to work with. Stars, borders, flowers, and different devices, are formed on cakes after they are iced, the execution of which depends on the ability and ingenuity of the artist. Baskets, Chinese and other temples, &amp;c., are formed on moulds by these means, first giving them a coating of <ingredient>white wax,</ingredient> which is brushed over them after it is melted, and when cold, the icing is formed on it like trellis-work; when finished, the mould is warmed, and the icing easily comes off. Some of the pipes which are used cannot be formed with paper, as the tape and star-pipes, which are made of tin, having a bag fastened to them in a similar manner to that generally used for dropping out Savoy biscuits, macaroons, &amp;c., only much smaller, the point of the tin tube of the one being fluted to form a star, and in the other it is flat, so that when the icing is forced or squeezed through, it comes out in a broad thin sheet, like a piece of tape. I employ a set of pipes made of tin, with small bags fastened to them; these are of different dimensions; the orifice of the round ones commences at the size of a common pin, and the tape pipes from 
 
<pb n="85" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=85"/>

a quarter to half an inch in width. I find these much better than paper ones, as the trouble and time which is lost in constantly making new ones is amply repaid by the others, as they are not very expensive and are always ready for use. These pipes should be in the hands of the confectioner what the pencil or brush is to the painter,--capable of performing wonders with men of genius. Some of the bon-bons, which may be seen in the shops, are proofs of what I assert; and many things are so cleverly done, that many persons would believe that they were either formed in a mould or modelled. I have not space to enlarge further on this subject, but much more might be given in explanation; therefore the artist must be guided by his own genius and fancy.<ref target="n6" height="superscript">*</ref></p>

<p><emph rend="italic">On the Construction of Assiettes and Pi&#232;ces Mont&#233;es.</emph>--To be a proficient in this part requires a general knowledge of the fine arts, particularly the principles of architecture; for without this, however well your piece may be finished with regard to workmanship, it still remains a dull, heavy, unmeaning mass, having no proportion nor a particle of true design in it. I have seen many pieces, and some in the principal shops, with these defects, although otherwise well executed. My limits will not allow me to enter into the details necessary to illustrate this part, therefore the artist must refer to books on the subject; but in the absence of these it is best to work from some correct drawing, which, with the few notes I shall subjoin, may serve for general purposes.</p>
<p>There are many prevailing styles or orders of architecture, as the Egyptian, Grecian, Roman, Saxon, Norman, Gothic, &amp;c. The Gothic is the most beautiful, being pointed, and is generally used for cathedrals and churches. The Norman is plain and simple, with semi-circular arches. The Saxon is after the same style, into which are introduced some ornamental workings. The Egyptian is more flat and square, embellished with hieroglyphics. In the Grecian and 
 
<pb n="88" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=88"/>

Roman architecture there are five orders, viz., Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite; and a building may be denominated Ionic, Corinthian, &amp;c., merely from its ornaments. The number of columns, windows, &amp;c., may be the same in either order, but varied in their proportions. The height of the columns in each is,--for the Tuscan, seven times its diameter; Doric, eight; Ionic, nine; Corinthian, ten; Composite, ten. The Tuscan is quite plain, without any ornament whatever; the Doric is distinguished by the channels and projecting intervals in the frieze, called tryglyphs; the Ionic by the ornaments of its capital, which are spiral, and called volutes; the Corinthian by the superior height of its capital, and its being ornamented with leaves, which support very small volutes; the Composite has also a tall capital, with leaves, but is distinguished from the Corinthian by having the large volutes of the Ionic capital. The Grecian and Roman orders differ in some respects as to the style of each, but for particulars refer to works on the subject. These orders are adopted for buildings, with various modifications, in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>The Chinese have a peculiar kind of style, which needs no description, as it is generally represented in this country on our delft ware, &amp;c. The Swiss style, which is something of the Gothic, is very well adapted for pi&#232;ces mont&#233;es, as well as the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders, they being more light and elegant.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">On Modelling.</emph>--This art is most important to the confectioner. It is not so difficult to accomplish as is generally supposed; it only requires patience and perseverance, with a close attention to the proportions and orders of nature. A few modelling tools, and facility in handling the paste, is all that is requisite to become an expert modeller. The form of the body must first be made with the fingers, the more minute parts with the tools and a pair of scissors; the last is very useful for dividing the fingers on the hands and the toes of a human figure. The proportions necessary to form it are these:--the whole length of a human being is six times the length of his feet, eight times of his head (that is, from the crown to the chin), ten times of his face, or the distance from the crown to the mouth; the thumb is as long as the nose or the biggest joint of the middle finger; the fore finger is shorter than the third, and the little finger is shorter than the third by one joint; the width of the wrist is as long as the thumb, end about a quarter; this varies; the ear is also the length of the nose, its breadth half its length; the arm is three times the length of the head, or four faces; the leg, from the knee-joint to the bottom of the foot, measures two heads and a-half; the foot, which is one-sixth of the human stature, if divided into three parts, will contain first the toes from the top of the large one to the lowest joint of the little one; next the middle of the foot, and lastly the heel and instep. There is also a slight difference between the proportions of a male and female. In infancy and very early youth the form is very much alike in both sexes. The head is oval, very much extended backwards, with the forehead and top of the head comparatively flat; the jaw-bones are short and have little depth; the bones of the nose are short and flat; in the male subject, the elevation of the frontal sinuses at the eyebrows, which characterizes the male head, is wanting; and the neck is very small in proportion to the head. In old age the cheeks and mouth fall in, because of the wasting of the teeth; the nose and chin approach each other; the fat is absorbed, and the muscles shrink, which covers the surface with wrinkles; and in time, the bones too are wasted, and the figure bends beneath its own weight. With these directions proceed to model the human figure, referring to anatomical plates for the position of the muscles, &amp;c. When the figure is complete, proceed to dress it in any style or costume you may fancy, making it from the same paste, and colouring it, giving the figure any attitude you may think proper, but always prefer the graceful, avoiding the stiff and awkward. The modelling of animals and birds is on the same principle, the wings of the latter

being pushed or cut in moulds or <implement>pasteboards.</implement> Flowers are mostly done with cutters in the form of the leaf of the flowers you would wish to represent; form the calyx in a mould, and fasten it on a piece of wire; fix the leaves on the calyx to imitate nature, and colour them accordingly.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XXII.--ON COLOURS.</hd>
<p>MANY of the colours prepared for use in this art come more properly under the denomination of dyes, alum and cream of tartar being used as a mordant; and many of them are prepared in the same manner as for dyeing. One of the principal colours requisite for the confectioner's use is coccinella, or cochineal. The sorts generally sold are the black, silver, foxy, and the granille. The insect is of two species, the fine and the wild cochineal; the fine differs from the wild in size, and is also covered with a white mealy powder. The best is of a deep mulberry colour, with a white powder between the wrinkles, and a bright red within. A great deal of adulteration is practised with this article, both at home and abroad; it is on this account that persons prefer the silver grain, because it cannot be so well sophisticated. Good cochineal should be heavy, dry, and more or less of a silvery colour, and without smell.</p>

In case the carmine has not separated properly, add a few drops of a <ingredient>solution of tin,</ingredient> or a <ingredient>solution of green vitriol,</ingredient> which is <ingredient>tin</ingredient> dissolved in <ingredient>muriatic acid,</ingredient> or the following may be substituted:--one ounce and a half of <ingredient>spirit of nitre,</ingredient> three scruples of <ingredient>sal-ammoniac,</ingredient> three scruples of <ingredient>tin</ingredient> dissolved in a bottle, and use a few drops as required. When the carmine has settled, decant off the clear which is liquid rouge. The first sediment is Florence lake, which remove, and dry the carmine for use. This preparation is by far superior to the first, for in this the same colour is obtained as before, which is the liquid rouge, the other and more expensive parts being invariably thrown away. The carmine can be obtained by the first process, as can be seen if the whole is poured into a clear bottle and allowed to settle, when the carmine will be deposited in a layer of bright red near the bottom.

<hd align="center">SECTION XXIII.--DISTILLATION.</hd>
<p>THIS art is of great importance to a confectioner, as it enables him to make his own oils, waters, and spirits for liqueurs and ratafias instead of purchasing at a high rate those vile adulterations which are often sold.</p>
<p>The still or apparatus for distilling consists of a <implement>cucurbit,</implement> which is a copper pot or <implement>boiler,</implement> and contains the wash, dregs, or infusions to be distilled. A cover, with a large tapering neck or pipe in the centre, is fixed on, and a continuation of small pipe, made either of tin 
 
<pb n="95" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=95"/>

or pewter, of several feet in length, is bent into a spiral form, and termed the worm. This is placed in a tub containing water, which is fastened on to the end of the neck. The joints or crevices are luted, to prevent evaporation, with a paste made of linseed meal, or equal portions of slacked lime or whitening, flour and salt, moistened with water, and spread on rags or pieces of bladder, when it is applied to the joints and crevices. The water in the tub where the worm is should be kept quite cold, except in distilling oil of anise-seeds; and for this purpose a tap or cock should be placed about half-way down the tub, that the top of the water may be drawn off when it is warm. Again fill it with cold water, and keep coarse cloths dipped in cold water to put round the alembic or still in case it should boil too fast. It is by these means that the steam or vapour which rises with the heat is condensed, and runs out at the end of the pipe in a small stream. If the operation is well conducted, it should never exceed this. When the phlegm arises, which is a watery insipid liquor, the receiver must be withdrawn, for if <emph rend="italic">a drop</emph> of it should run in, it must be cohobated, that is, re-distilled, as it will thicken the spirit and spoil the taste.</p>
<p>The still should not be filled above three parts full, to prevent it rising over the neck, should it happen to boil violently, as in this case it would spoil what is already drawn, which must be re-distilled.</p>
<subsection class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">ON ESSENTIAL OILS.</hd>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p>To obtain these from <ingredient>plants</ingredient> or <ingredient>peels,</ingredient> the articles should be infused for two or three days, or even longer, in a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> until it has fully penetrated the pores of the materials. For this purpose <ingredient>roots</ingredient> should be cut into thin slices, <ingredient>barks</ingredient> reduced to a coarse powder, and <ingredient>seeds</ingredient> slightly bruised; those of soft and loose texture require to be infused two or three days, the harder and more compact a week or two, whilst some tender <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> and plants require to be distilled directly. After the solvent has fully penetrated, distil it with an open fire; that is, a fire under the still like a common <implement>washing copper,</implement> which immediately strikes the bottom. Regulate the fire so as to make it boil as speedily as possible, and that the oil may continue to distil freely during the whole process; for the longer it is submitted to an unnecessary heat without boiling, a greater portion of the oil is mixed with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> than there would otherwise be. The oil comes over the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and either sinks to the bottom or swims on the top, according as it is lighter or heavier than that fluid. What comes over at first is more fragrant than that towards the end, which is thicker, and should be re-distilled by a gentle heat, when it leaves a resinous matter behind.</p>
<p>All <purpose>essential oils,</purpose>

after they are distilled, should be suffered to stand some days in open bottles or vessels, loosely covered with paper to keep out the dust, until they have lost their disagreeable fiery odour, and become quite limpid: put them into small bottles, and keep them <pb n="96" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=96"/>

quite full in a cold place. The light oils pass over the swan neck of the common still, but the heavier ones will not so readily, therefore a large low head is preferable; the heavier oils are those from <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> <ingredient>allspice,</ingredient> <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> &amp;c., or such as contain a portion of resin.</p>
<p>Some plants yield three times as much oil, if gathered when the flowers begin to fall off,--as <ingredient>lavender;</ingredient> others when young, before they have sent forth any flowers,--as <ingredient>sage;</ingredient> and others when the flowers begin to appear,--as <ingredient>thyme.</ingredient></p>
<p>All fragrant <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> yield a large portion of oil when produced in dry soils and warm summers. <ingredient>Herbs</ingredient> and <ingredient>flowers</ingredient> give out a larger quantity of oil after they have been partly dried in a dry shady place. Four pounds of the <ingredient>leaves of the dried mint</ingredient> yield one ounce of oil, but six pounds of fresh leaves only three drachms and a-half. This oil is more fine and bright when rectified--that is, re-distilled.</p>
<p>After the distillation of one oil, the worm should be carefully cleansed, by passing a little <ingredient>spirit of wine</ingredient> through it, before another is proceeded with.</p>
</recipe>

<p>A great quantity of oil is wasted by confectioners when they preserve their lemon and orange peels by boiling them in open vessels instead of a still; what is saved by this means alone would soon repay the expense of the apparatus.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">DISTILLED WATERS.</hd>
<p>These are obtained in a similar manner to the oils, with a high narrow-necked still, and differ from them by the oil being retained or united with the water. Plants for this purpose should be gathered fresh on a dry day, as the water drawn from them in this state is more aromatic when they are dry; for the oil is mixed with an aqueous fluid in the plant, which concretes and separates in drying.</p>
<p>Herbs should be bruised and steeped for a day in about three times their quantity of water when green, but considerably more when dry; but at all times sufficient water should be added that some may be left to prevent the herbs or flowers being burnt to the bottom of the still. After all the water is drawn, the distillation should continue so long as any taste or smell of the ingredients comes over; and the fire should be so regulated that the water may run in a small continued stream.</p>
<p>If a superior article is required, it must be re-distilled by a gentle heat, with the addition of a little pure spirit (about one-twentieth part) which has not got any bad smell.</p>

<hd align="center">SPIRITS FOR LIQUEURS.</hd>
<p>Spirits and alcohol are obtained by the distillation of fermented articles. The peculiar taste of each depends on the essential oil of the article from which it is prepared being held in solution: therefore, by knowing the nature of its oil, alcohol may be made to imitate any desired spirit. A few drops of nitric ether added to malt spirit will impart to it the flavour of cognac brandy; and two scruples of benzoic acid, mixed with one quart of rum, will give it the taste of arrack. Brandy is generally recommended for the use of the confectioner in making spirits for liqueurs, but a superior article may be made with less expense from rectified spirits of wine, or pure spirit which has neither taste nor smell, as the spirit afterwards drawn will only have the flavour of the articles with which it is required to be impregnated. Rectified spirits may be obtained from the dregs of beer, cider, ale or wine, suitable for any purpose, as well as from brandy.</p>
<p>Spirits rise in the still with less heat than watery infusions, therefore it is best to distil by means of the <implement>bain-marie,</implement> that is, by the still being placed in another vessel containing water. This method is more safe, as it prevents accidents, and the articles from being burnt.</p>
<p>Common spirits may be deprived of their impurities by mixing them with an equal quantity of water, and distilling them by a gentle heat, or in a water-bath. Continue the operation until the phlegm arises, which will appear milky and is of a nauseous taste. A great quantity of the oil which it retained will remain in the water. If the spirit was very impure, a second rectification may be necessary, as before. A very pure and tasteless spirit may be obtained by mixing with the spirit, after rectification, one-fourth of its weight of pure dry salt of wormwood or tartar. Let it stand a little time in a <emph rend="italic">gentle heat,</emph> and distil in the <implement>bain-marie.</implement> A small portion of alum being added 
 
<pb n="98" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=98"/>

prevents any of the salt being brought over with the spirit. The result is pure alcohol. It may be reduced to proof spirit by mixing twenty ounces of alcohol with seventeen of water, by weight.</p>

<hd align="center">SECTION XXV.--THE STOVE OR HOT CLOSET.</hd>
<p>THIS is a useful and indispensable appendage in confectionary; it is generally constructed like a cupboard in the recess of a wall. The walls or sides should be composed of bricks, or wood lined with tin or sheet iron, to retain the heat, with pieces of wood nailed or fastened in the sides, about four inches asunder, to form a groove for trays or boards to rest on, which is necessary for the drying of lozenges, comfits, bon-bons, &amp;c.; there should also be a few strong shifting shelves made either of small bars of round iron or wood, like a grating, on which candy pots or sieves may be placed; the grooves for these should be so constructed as to be capable of inclination so as to drain off the syrup from the candy pots without taking them from the shelves; the door should be made to shut close, with a small door at the top to let out any excess of heat. I have before remarked that it may be heated by means of many of the modern stoves. At places where the oven is heated with wood, furze, &amp;c., a common iron pot or <implement>crock</implement> with three legs is filled with the live embers, or it may be filled with burning charcoal and covered with wood ashes, which is replenished night and morning, which gives the heat required.</p>

<hd align="center">THE PASTRY-COOK</hd>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">INTRODUCTION.</hd>
<p>WE now come to a very important, because a very difficult, branch of the art of baking, whether exercised as a profession, or by private individuals, namely the manufacturing of what are technically called <emph rend="italic">"fancy goods."</emph> The reader scarcely need be informed, that this term includes all those varieties of baked manufactured eatables, in which such ingredients as sugar, eggs, spice, and butter, are used, with many other not necessary to enumerate here.</p>
<p>It ought to be observed, that the following directions for making the kind of goods alluded to, have been all <emph rend="italic">tested,</emph> and found to be so exceedingly accurate as to proportions, that a deviation in a quantity so small as an egg, or even half an egg, will deteriorate the quality of the article. These directions are not generally known in the trade, and out of the trade they are entirely, we believe, unknown. They will be found, therefore, a valuable acquisition to those ladies who manage their own domestic affairs, and who are in the habit of making little <emph rend="italic">knick-knacks</emph> for their children, or their dessert tables.</p>
<p>Previous to giving the directions in question, it will be necessary for our readers to be made acquainted with the mode of preparing certain articles, which are more or less employed in the manufacturing fancy goods. We are aware that there are many private individuals who would object to use the preparation called "honey-water," as well as that called "prepared treacle," on the ground of their consisting chiefly of drugs. As regards, however, the use of carbonate of ammonia (honey-water), it may be safely affirmed, that there is, in small quantities, nothing unhealthy in it, but on the contrary. The truth however is, the carbonate of ammonia used in biscuits, &amp;c., is volatilized by the heat of baking, and of course it all escapes. Its operation is therefore mechanical, and the only effect it has upon the biscuit is to make it light.</p>
<p>With regard to the article called prepared treacle, which consists of treacle, alum, and pearlash, we have to observe, that alum taken in considerable quantities is decidedly unwholesome, it being of a powerfully astringent nature; but in the very small quantity here 
 
<pb n="104" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=104"/>

prescribed, and considering that treacle is an asperient, and will consequently counteract the effects of the alum, we should say, that there can be no harm in using it. Pearlash, being an alkali, we should consider rather beneficial than otherwise, as it would prevent the treacle of the ginger-bread turning acid on the stomach.</p>
<p>Having made these preliminary observations, we shall at once proceed to give directions for making those preparations used in pastry and fancy goods. The break alluded to in making fancy biscuits, is an instrument similar to that used in manufacturing ship-biscuits, but of course of much smaller dimensions.</p>

<ingredient>butter</ingredient> two pounds twelve ounces, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> one pound twelve ounces, <ingredient>currants</ingredient> five pounds, <ingredient>citron</ingredient> one pound and a-half, <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> six ounces, <ingredient>nutmegs,</ingredient> <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> of equal parts, in powder, two ounces; <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> twenty, <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> half a pint--these proportions allow for the cake being iced. If more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is preferred, the quantity must be the same as the <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> but less is used in this instance, that the cake may be light, and also to allow for the fruit, which would make it too sweet. Double the quantity of <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> may be used if required, as some persons prefer more.</p>
<p>Warm a smooth pan, large enough for the mixture; put in the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and reduce it to a fine cream, by working it about the pan with your hand. In summer the pan need not be warmed, as it can be reduced to a cream without; but in the winter keep the mixture as warm as possible, without oiling the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Add the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and mix it well with the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> until it becomes white and feels light in the hand. Break in two or three <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> at a time, and work the mixture well, before any more is added. Continue doing this until they are all used and it becomes light; then add the <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> <ingredient>peel,</ingredient> <ingredient>spice,</ingredient> and <ingredient>almonds,</ingredient> some or most of these being previously cut in thin slices, the peel having also been cut into small thin strips and bits. When these are incorporated, mix in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> lightly: put it in a hoop with paper over the bottom and round the sides, and placed on a <implement>baking-plate.</implement> Large cakes require three or four pieces of stiff paper round the sides; and if the cake is very large, a pipe or funnel, made either of stiff paper or tin, and well buttered, should be put in the centre, and the mixture placed round it; this is to allow the middle of the cake to be well baked, otherwise the edge would be burnt two or three inches deep before it could be properly done. Place the tin plates containing the cake on another, the surface of which is 
 
<pb n="108" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=108"/>

covered an inch or two thick with sawdust or fine ashes to protect the bottom. Bake it in an oven at a moderate heat. The time required to bake it will depend on the state of the oven and the size of the cake. When the cake is cold, proceed to ice it. (See Icings for Cakes.) Wedding-cakes have generally, first, a coating on the top of <ingredient>almond icing;</ingredient> when this is dry, the sides and top are covered with <ingredient>royal or white icing.</ingredient> Fix on any <ingredient>gum paste or other ornaments</ingredient> whilst it is wet; and when dry, ornament it with <ingredient>piping,</ingredient> <ingredient>orange-blossoms,</ingredient> <ingredient>ribbon,</ingredient> &amp;c.; the surface and sides are often covered with small knobs of <ingredient>white sugar candy</ingredient> whilst the icing is wet.</p>

<hd align="center">OF PASTES IN GENERAL--PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</hd>
<p>[The first grand object for our consideration is the proper method of <emph rend="italic">making paste;</emph> for upon our skill in that important branch of the pastry-cook's art, will the success of our future operations mainly depend. Whenever the paste happens to be ill made, its bad effects will invariably appear in the baking; and if even by chance the colour should turn out tolerably well, it will be still highly unsatisfactory to competent judges; in short, paste thus made will always be heavy, have an unpleasant flavour, and, above all, be very indigestible; and, indeed, it is owing to the general ignorance that prevails respecting its proper amalgamation, that good pastry is so rarely made; and that the number of good family pastry-cooks is so small.</p>
<p>It is much more easy to <emph rend="italic">bake</emph> pastry than to make it. The oven requires care, constant attention, and practice, it is true; but the art of making pastry is quite another thing--an art that admits of no mediocrity--a good memory, taste practice, and dexterity, being absolutely necessary in that branch of the business; for it is really from the manner of mixing the various ingredients of which it is composed that it acquires its good or bad quality.</p>
<p>An indispensable requisite is cleanliness in those who have to prepare elegant viands, and the most scrupulous attention must be paid to delicate management and order. In a pastry-cook these requisitions are absolutely indispensable.</p>

<hd align="center">TO MAKE PUFF PASTE.</hd>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>I shall now endeavour to give directions for the composition of this delicate and elegant kind of paste.</p>
 
<pb n="125" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=125"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Ingredients.</emph>--Twelve ounces of fine-sifted <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> twelve ounces of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> two drachms of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yolks of two eggs.</ingredient></p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Manner of Working.</emph>--Having placed the twelve ounces of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, make a small hole in the middle; in which, put the two drachms of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> the <ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> and nearly a glass of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> and with the ends of the fingers of your right-hand gradually mix in the surrounding <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> adding a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> where necessary, till the paste is of a proper consistence, rather firm than otherwise; then prove it by leaning your hand on the board, and working it for some minutes, when the paste will become soft to the touch, and glossy in appearance.</p>
<p>It is of importance to observe, that this paste should be neither too stiff nor too soft, but of a proper medium; yet it will be better when it is a little too soft than when too stiff.</p>
<p>The same process must be attended to in summer as in winter; though many persons pretend that this kind of paste should be made stiffer in summer than in winter, on account of the difference in the two seasons. As far as regards the hardness of the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> this mode of reasoning has certainly some truth in it; for, inasmuch as the winter is favourable to the work, so does the heat of summer render our operations troublesome and difficult, and prevent them sometimes from having the desired effect, particularly in the making of puff paste.</p>
<p>The reason why summer paste should not be made softer than that made in winter, is this:--if, when the paste is soft, it be buttered, and afterwards placed on ice, as is practised in summer, the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which is a greasy substance, will become quickly congealed by the coldness of the ice; while the paste, which is only a moist body, will scarcely be affected by it; and, consequently, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> being frozen, and the paste soft, it will follow that, in working it, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> not being held by the paste sufficiently firm to unite with it, will break into small pieces; and after having received the two first turns, will appear in small lumps, like large peas. On rolling it again, and placing on the ice, the cold acts with greater force on the small particles of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which quickly become like so many icicles, and the paste, in consequence, will be completely spoiled; for, in baking, these particles of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> melt, and, separating themselves from the paste, render it incapable of uniting with them.</p>
<p>When the paste has been made as above, take three-quarters of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> in pieces, which for twenty minutes has been in a pail of <ingredient>spring water,</ingredient> thoroughly imbued with a few pounds of <ingredient>pounded ice</ingredient> previously well washed; then squeeze and work well in a napkin in order to separate the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from it, and at the same time to render it soft, and above all, of an equal consistence; then as quickly as possible roll the paste on a marble slab, into a square, and placing the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the middle, cover with an equal thickness of paste, by raising the paste over it. After rolling it out two or three feet in length 
 
<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=126"/>

fold it into three parts by doubling one part over the other; after which roll it out again, and fold it once more into three equal parts--now roll it to a greater length, envelope it with a clean linen cloth which has been dusted with some sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--lay this on some finely pounded ice, taking care to have several folds of cloth between the paste and the ice, to prevent the moisture striking through--place on the top of the paste a dish containing some pounded ice--this serves to keep the surface of the paste cool, and also to prevent it becoming soft by the action of the air. After three or four minutes, remove the dish, and turn the paste upside down, instantly covering it a before. This operation should be performed three times in the same manner, and with the same precautions.</p>
<p>Lastly, roll it out two or three times according to what you intend to make of it, and use it as expeditiously as possible, lest the heat of the season should render it too soft to handle, or prevent its having the desired effect in baking.</p>
<p>Thus, in less than half an hour, it is possible to make very fine <purpose>puff paste,</purpose>

having previously everything ready--the ice pounded, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> frozen, and the oven quite hot, otherwise it cannot be done. This is important, as it is sometimes an hour before the oven can be made hot; and therefore the paste should not be begun to be made till the oven is half heated. The following is another method.]</p>

<hd align="center">THE BAKER.</hd>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">INTRODUCTION.</hd>
<p>BAKING, or the art of making bread, is amongst the earliest modes resorted to by the more advanced portions of mankind for the preparation of food. In the early ages, however, loaf or leavened bread was unknown, as it is amongst uncivilized nations to this day. The North American Indians contrive, by pounding their maize, or Indian corn, to make a sort of cake, which they bake by means of hot cinders. This serves them, and, indeed, occasionally the Anglo-Americans, as a substitute for loaf or leavened bread, and may be called unleavened bread. But in some parts of the world bread is not known; in others it may be known, but is not used--as amongst the people inhabiting the vast Pampas on the Rio de la Plata, where scarcely anything is eaten but beef.</p>
<p>Bread may be thus defined;--A nutritive substance made of corn, generally wheat, or other farinaceous or mealy vegetables, ground or reduced into flour or meal, that is, a powder more or less fine, and kneaded or mixed with water, and baked in an oven, upon hot ashes or other grise. This process makes unleavened bread, or, in other words, unfermented bread, or what is now called biscuits. To leavened or fermented bread, that is, the bread generally used in our houses, there must be an addition, yeast, or some other substance which has the property of promoting fermentation.</p>
<p>The origin or etymology of the word bread is not without interest. Horne Tooke says, bread is <emph rend="italic">brayed</emph> grain, from the verb to bray or pound in a <implement>mortar,</implement> the ancient way in which flour was made. The meaning of bread, therefore, is something brayed--brayed wheat, or wheat bread--pease brayed, or bread--oats brayed, or bread, &amp;c. The word bread was spelt differently in different ages; thus we have <emph rend="italic">brede,</emph> breed, &amp;c. Dough, Horne Tooke says, comes from the Saxon word <emph rend="italic">deaw-ian,</emph> to wet, to moisten. <emph rend="italic">Dough,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">dow,</emph> means wetted. The bread, that is, brayed corn or grain, by being wetted becomes <emph rend="italic">dough.</emph></p>
<p>Loaf comes from the Anglo-Saxon word <emph rend="italic">hlif-ian,</emph> to raise, to lift up. 
 
<pb n="129" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=129"/>

Thus, after the bread or brayed corn has been wetted, by which it becomes dough, then follows the <emph rend="italic">leaven,</emph> by which it becomes <emph rend="italic">loaf,</emph> that is, <emph rend="italic">raised.</emph> Leaven is derived from the French word <emph rend="italic">lever</emph> to raise.</p>
<p>Bread, in some countries, is not made entirely of meal, much less of wheaten flour. In many parts of Sweden, the bread is composed partly of the bark of trees, particularly during winter.</p>
<p>In Westphalia, a kind of very coarse black bread is made, of which the peasants bake one large loaf for the whole week. This is divided for use with a saw. It is called pumpernickel, and is sometimes exported. In many parts of Germany, bread is made of grain nearly entire, or but just bruised, which is very coarse, and frequently forms part of the food of horses.</p>
<p>The Romans, before they had acquired the art of baking, were called, either by way of distinction or reproach, the pulse-eating people. According to some authorities, indeed, the earlier nations knew no other use of their meal than to make of it a kind of porridge. Such was the food of the Roman soldiers for several centuries, or at most their skill extended no farther than to knead unleavened dough into cakes or biscuits. Even at present, as has been before intimated, there are many countries where the luxury of bread is unknown.</p>
<p>Loaf-bread is seldom used in the northern parts of Europe and Asia, except by the higher classes of inhabitants. You never see loaves in Sweden, though in the towns rolls are common enough. Gottenburg is a considerable town, containing between twenty and thirty thousand inhabitants. In the year 1812 it was crowded with merchants from all parts of Europe, being at that time the great connecting link between Great Britain and the Continent. Towards the end of that year only, the captain of an English packet ordered a Gottenburg baker to bake for him a quantity of bread, amounting altogether to the value of one pound sterling. The baker was astonished, and in fact confounded, at so great an order, and refused to comply till the captain gave him security that he would carry off and pay for the loaves, declaring that he could never dispose of so great a quantity of bread in Gottenburg, if it were left on his hands. In the country parts of Sweden, nothing in the character of bread is to be met with, excepting rye cakes, which are represented as nearly as hard as flint, and which are only baked twice a year.</p>

<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS ON BAKING.</hd>
<p>Baking, as a business or profession, was never confined to the baking of common bread alone, that is to say, bread in every-day use. A baker we take to mean a person who bakes and prepares any farinaceous substance intended for human food. If this definition be correct, then it will follow that not only loaf-bread baking, biscuit-baking, fancy-bread baking, belong to the business of the baker, but also pastry 
 
<pb n="130" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=130"/>

making and confectionery. We know, indeed, that all these branches are frequently to a certain extent practised by the same individual, and therefore, in a work of this kind, they ought all to be treated of, which we intend to do under separate heads.</p>
<p>The ancients had a great variety of spice bread and sweetmeats, and these, there is every reason to believe, were produced by the persons called bakers; pastry-cooks and confectioners being unknown as separate professions. The Asiatics were exceedingly fond of sweetmeats, and there can be little or no doubt that a similar taste was introduced by them among the Romans, when they were carried to Rome to practise their calling there. The Rhodians, we are told, had a particular kind of bread sweetened with honey, so exquisitely pleasant, that it was eaten with other delicacies after dinner by way of dessert.</p>
<p>The French, who are excellent bakers, have a great variety of breads, and these for the most part have been long introduced into Great Britain. The common bread of that country, or bread for general use, may be divided into three classes:--wheaten bread, made of the finest flour, sometimes called firsts; second, or household bread, made of flour somewhat coarser, called seconds; and brown bread, made of flour called thirds, and sometimes of flour of various degrees coarser than thirds. The coarseness or fineness of flour (supposing the wheat of the same quality) depends upon the dressing, or the separating of the flour from the husks of the wheat, after it has been reduced to a powder. The finest flour is entirely separated from the bran or husks--the other description not entirely so, but the broad bran is removed from the coarsest flour. The writers in many of our celebrated Encyclop&#230;dias say, that "our household bread is made of the whole substance of the grain, without the separation of either the finest flour or the coarsest bran." This is a mistake altogether.</p>
<p>In making pure wheaten loaf bread, no other ingredients should be employed but flour, water, yeast, or some other innocent fermenting matter. Various other ingredients are used, principally by those engaged in making bread for sale. The London bakers employ alum, for the purpose of making bread whiter, &amp;c. Home-baked bread is never so white, even when made from the same flour, as that produced by the public baker; but of this we shall speak when we come to describe the methods of bread-making used by public bakers; at present we shall confine ourselves to bread as made in families for daily use.</p>
<p>The goodness of bread, whether baked at home or abroad, will depend, firstly, upon the quality of the flour employed; secondly, upon the quality of the yeast; and, thirdly, upon the skill and care of the baker. The process of baking, though simple enough, requires some experience on the part of him or her who may undertake to perform it. We need scarcely say, that experience is only to be acquired in one way, and that way is too obvious to need pointing out. To judge

of flour, experience is also necessary; but any one may form a pretty accurate idea whether it is good or bad, by attending to the following directions:--If flour is of a fine white colour, it may be pronounced good, so far as colour is concerned; but if it be brown, it shows that either it was made from bad wheat, or that it has been coarsely dressed--that is, particles of bran, more or less fine, have been left in it. Brown flour, however, may be of a good, sound quality, and fine white flour not so. To judge of flour, take a portion in your hand and press it firmly between your thumb and fore-finger, at the same time rubbing it gently, for the purpose of making a level surface upon the flour. By this means you will be able to ascertain the colour, by observing the pressed and smooth surface; and the act of pressing and smoothing it, will enable you to ascertain these facts. If it feel loose and lively in the hand, it is of good quality; if on the contrary it feels dead or damp, or in other words clammy, it is decidedly bad.</p>
<p>Flour ought to be a few weeks old before it is used; but it will keep good much longer, if kept in a dry place covered over. But it is, perhaps, better to trust to your miller or mealman, who, if you are a good and constant customer, will take care to serve you with good flour for his own sake; for if he employs any tricks, he is sure to be discovered when the bread comes out of the oven.</p>
<p>It has been found by analysis, that wheat flour consists of three principal substances, namely, starch, gluten, and sugar, and a very small portion of albumen; of these, the starch is the most nourishing as food. The gluten resembles animal glue in its tenacious qualities; and its smell, when subjected to a strong heat, is f&#x0153;tid, like burning horn or feathers. It will not ferment in warm water and yeast, but like a piece of flesh will become putrid. Mr. Edlin says, that "this substance is totally different from vegetable matter, but rather resembling animal." The gluten in wheat-flour is the cause of its forming an adhesive paste with water, and of its rising in leaven.</p>
<p>Starch forms the most considerable part of wheat-flour, and there is reason to believe, from so many persons subsisting on potatoes, which contain much starch and no gluten, that it is the most nutritious; but starch cannot be made into bread, because it wants the mucilaginous gluten to give it tenacity, and the saccharine matter, or sugar, to induce fermentation.</p>
<p>From experiments made by Mr. Edlin, it appears that a pound of wheat contains three ounces of bran, ten ounces of starch, six drachms of gluten, and two drachms of sugar; which, with the loss of two ounces in grinding and reducing the flour to starch, make one pound, or sixteen ounces. From this it appears that he did not discover the albumen, which M. Seguin considers the fermenting principle.</p>
<p>Mr. Edlin also ascertained by experiment, that starch, isinglass, and sugar, mixed in proper quantities, and fermented with yeast, will make a light and porous bread.</p>
 
<pb n="132" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=132"/>

<p>Flour-paste may be considered as merely a viscid and elastic tissue, the interstices of which are filled with starch, albumen, and sugar. We know that it is from the gluten that the dough derives its property of rising on the admixture of leaven; the leaven acting on the sweet principle of the wheat, gives rise in succession to the vinous and acetous fermentation, and of consequence to alcohol, acetic, and carbonic acids. The latter gas tends to fly off, but the gluten resists its disengagement, expands like a membrane--forms a multitude of little cavities, which give lightness and sponginess to the bread.</p>
<p>To judge of good yeast, no positive directions can be given. Yeast should always be fresh, and if made from table ale it is better, because less bitter than that made from very strong ale. If the yeast is sour, the dough will not rise. Originally what is called leaven was uniformly employed, and it is now sometimes used as a substitute for yeast. Those who use it, keep a pound or more dough from baking to baking. It is kept in a wooden barrel, or bowl, covered with flour. Before it is fit to use, it must be both stale and sour. Bread made in this way is said to be more digestible, but it is not so pleasant to the taste. Leaven is now only used at sea.</p>
<p>A good oven is necessary for the production of good bread. If the oven be heated, as in country places, by dry wood, furze, or fern, burnt in the oven itself, it ought to be built round, not long, as there will be in the former case a greater equality of heat. The roof should be from twenty inches to two feet high in the centre; the mouth no larger than will be sufficient to admit the bread. But many people who make their own bread send it to be baked at the baker's. We have seen good ovens attached to a stove, and heated by the kitchen fire. These are not sufficiently capacious to contain loaves enough for the consumption of a large family, but they answer the purpose of a small family very well. To save room, it will be necessary, in stove ovens, to bake in tins. Bread thus baked is much more smooth and neat than when baked in the ordinary way; but the pleasant crispness of the crust is wanting.</p>
<p>The ovens used in London and some other large towns are, for the most part, heated by a furnace placed on one side. The heat in these ovens is very equable, and the baker is enabled to keep it up at all times with very little trouble, and with less expense than by the old method.</p>

--An expeditious and simple method<pb n="133" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=133"/>

of making bread for a small family is as follows:--Take half a bushel of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> put all this <ingredient>flour</ingredient> excepting about four pounds into a tub or pan, and in winter place it before the fire to warm. Mix six ounces or half a pound of powdered <ingredient>salt</ingredient> with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--but it would be better to work the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in with the dough. Then take a pint of good fresh <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and well mix it with a sufficient quantity of blood-warm <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Make a deep hole in the middle of the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient>--pour the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> gradually into the hole of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mixing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with your hands till both become well incorporated. Cover this mixture up, and place it near the fire till it has well risen, that is to say, fermented. Then work the other <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into it with your fists, till it becomes a nice, smooth, tough dough. Make this dough into loaves, and bake in an oven properly heated: if too hot, your bread will be burnt outside, and not done inside. It will take from an hour and a half to two hours in baking, but the bread should always remain in the oven half an hour after it has become brown; or, as it is technically called, it will not be soaked through. This is a method we have known to be used with success in many families, though not aware that it ever has been published before.</p>
<p>For large bakings, the following method is best:--</p>
<p><variation>The common way is to put the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a trough, tub, or pan, sufficiently large to permit its swelling to three times the size it at present occupies. Make a deep hole in the middle of the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> For half a bushel of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> take a pint of thick fresh <ingredient>yeast</ingredient>--that is, <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> not frothy--mix it with about a pint of <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> made blood-warm. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> must not be hot. Then gently mix with the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> as much <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as will bring it to the consistence of a thick or stiff batter--pour this mixture into the hole in the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and cover it by sprinkling it over with <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--lay over it a flannel or sack, and in cold weather place it near, not too near, the fire. This is called laying the sponge. When the sponge--or this mixture of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--has risen enough to crack the dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> by which it was covered, sprinkle over the top six ounces of <ingredient>salt</ingredient>--(more or less to suit the taste): mind, the time when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is applied is of great importance. We have seen directions in which we are told to mix the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> The effect of this would be to prevent fermentation, or, in other words, to prevent the sponge from rising. After the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is sprinkled over the sponge, work it with the rest of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and add from time to time <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> (not hot) till the whole is sufficiently moistened; that is, scarcely as moist as pie-crust. The degree of moistness, however, which the mixture ought to possess can only be taught by experience--when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is mixed with the composition, then work it well by pushing your fists into it--then rolling it out with your hands--folding it up again--kneading it again with your fists, till it is completely mixed, and formed into a stiff, tough, smooth substance, which is called dough--great care must be taken, that your dough be not too moist on the one hand, and on the other that every particle of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=134"/>

be thoroughly incorporated. Form your dough into a lump like a large dumpling, again cover it up, and keep it warm to rise or ferment. After it has been rising about twenty minutes, or half an hour, make the dough into loaves, first having shaken a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over the board to prevent sticking. The loaves may be made up in tin moulds, or if it be desired to make it into loaves to be baked without the use of moulds, divide the dough into equal parts, according to the size you wish to have your loaves--make each part into the form of a dumpling, and lay one dumpling, if we may so speak, upon another--then, the oven being properly heated, by means of an instrument called a <implement>peel,</implement> a sort of wooden shovel, put in your loaves, and immediately shut the door as close as possible. A good deal of nicety is required in properly placing the loaves in the oven--they must be put pretty closely together. The <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will take from an hour and a-half to two hours to bake properly.</variation></p>

<hd align="center">ARTIFICIAL YEASTS.</hd>
<p>Previous to entering upon the subject of public baking, by which so large a portion of the people are supplied with their daily bread, it will be necessary to lay before our readers some of the various methods by which yeast is compounded. Of brewers' yeast, or the yeast of ale and beer, we have already spoken, and therefore it will be necessary again to revert to it. Several of the following directions for the preparations of yeast have been long before the public, and some of them the writer has not had an opportunity of testing by experience, but there is no reason to doubt of their efficiency; of the patent yeast, however, now pretty generally used by the public bakers, he can speak with confidence, having witnessed the whole process of making it, and experienced its perfect applicability to the manufacturing of bread. We shall first, however, treat of the mode of preserving brewers' yeast.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Yeast to Preserve.</purpose>

--Take a quantity and work it well with a <implement>whisk,</implement> till it becomes thin; then procure a wooden dish or platter, clean and dry, and with a soft brush lay a thin layer of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> on the dish, and turn the top downwards to keep out the dust, but not the air, which is to dry it. When the first coat is dry, lay on another, and let that dry, and so continue till the quantity is sufficient; by this means, it may soon be made two or three inches thick, when it may be preserved perfectly good, in dry tin canisters, for a long time. When you use it for baking, cut a piece and lay it in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> till it is dissolved, when it is fit for use.</p>

This artificial yeast may now be put into a bottle for use. The great advantage of this yeast is, that it may be made in situations where it is impossible to procure brewers' yeast. The foregoing operation need not be performed but once by the same individual, as the process may be carried on by mixing this <emph rend="italic">artificial yeast,</emph> which was invented by the late <attribution>Mr. Henry,</attribution> with the preceding preparation recommended by Dr. Lettsom, which it will cause to ferment the same as brewers' yeast.</p>
<p><variation>Another artificial yeast is made as follows:--Take half a pound of <ingredient>fine flour,</ingredient> the same quantity of coarse <ingredient>brown sugar,</ingredient> and a quarter of a peck of <ingredient>bruised malt;</ingredient> boil these over the fire for a quarter of an hour, in half a gallon of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then strain the liquor through a sieve into an upright jug, and when cooled to 80 degrees of heat, add one pint of the <ingredient>artificial Seltzer water,</ingredient> or, if procurable, <ingredient>Seltzer water</ingredient> itself, or <ingredient>water impregnated with fixed air</ingredient>--the mixture will soon begin to ferment: it should then be set before the fire, and when ebullition ceases, the yeast will sink to the bottom.

<hd align="center">ALUM, POTATOES, &amp;C.</hd>
<p>These ingredients are now considered indispensable by the London bakers in the manufacturing of second or household bread, that is, the bread in daily use in the metropolis. The effects of alum upon bread are not well understood; but it is generally said to bleach and act as an astringent. Accum says, that "the theory of the bleaching property of alum, as manifested in the panification (making into bread) of an inferior kind of flour, is by no means well understood; and indeed it is really surprising, that the effect should be produced by so small a quantity of that substance, two or three ounces of alum being sufficient for a sack of flour. From experiments in which I have been employed, with the assistance of skilful bakers, I am authorized to state, that without the addition of alum, it does not appear possible to make white, light, and porous bread, such as is used in this metropolis, unless the flour be of the very best quality."</p>
<p>Mr. A. Booth, the lecturer on Chemistry, asserts, that "alum bleaches from the attraction of alumina, one of its constituent parts, to the colouring matter of the flour, and also acts as an astringent on the bread."</p>
<p>If these opinions are to be relied upon, of course the question is settled, as to the indispensability of alum in making London bread. Accum asserts, that he, in conjunction with skilful bakers, has tested the thing by experiments, which prove that alum cannot be dispensed with. For our part, we are inclined to think, that the whiteness of the London bread is owing, in some degree, to the process of baking, a process widely differing from that followed by women in making home-baked bread; which, as we have elsewhere asserted, is never so white or so porous, though made of the same flour, as bakers' bread. Accum, whatever talent he might possess as a chemist, was a fraudulent writer, and therefore his assertions are not to be relied on, as to the experiments which he alleges he had made. We agree with him, however, in his observation, that "the theory of the bleaching property of alum, &amp;c., is by no means well understood."</p>
<p>The quantity of alum used in baking is much less than the public generally imagine, even by the most fraudulent of cheap-bread bakers, and indeed much smaller than many of the bakers themselves imagine. This may appear a strange assertion, and it is probably one never made before in print; but a little explanation will make the point quite clear. It is well known that the bakers are liable to a heavy fine if alum is found on their premises. To avoid this liability as much as possible, they have long been in the habit of buying the 
 
<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=138"/>

alum ready powdered at the druggists, under the appellation of <emph rend="italic">stuff.</emph> The druggists keep this <emph rend="italic">stuff,</emph> which the bakers imagine is unadulterated ground or powdered alum, but which is, in fact, a compound, consisting of one part alum, and three parts of muriate of soda, that is, common table salt. This compound is made by pounding the salt with the alum in a <implement>mortar,</implement> and is kept by the druggists in pound packages, which they sell at twopence each. For this statement we have the authority of several druggists, and the evidence of our own eyes. It may appear extraordinary that the bakers should suffer themselves to be so <emph rend="italic">cheated;</emph> but be this as it may, we believe it to be the fact. It should be recollected, that few bakers are readers, particularly of scientific or medical works. In the fourth edition of Gray's supplement to the Pharmacop&#x0153;ia and Treatise on Pharmacology, under the head of <emph rend="italic">stuff,</emph> this term is thus defined:--"Alum, in small crystals, one pound, common salt three pounds, to mix with flour for baking." We have the evidence of our own senses for knowing, that the respectable bakers of home or household bread do not put more than half a pound or eight ounces of <emph rend="italic">stuff</emph> to a sack of flour; and this stuff, as we have shown on the authority of Gray, only contains one-fourth part, or two ounces, of alum, the remainder being common salt. Some persons, however, will ask for powdered alum, but the druggist, knowing from the quantity required and the appearance of his customer that it is wanted for baking, uniformly serves him with the before-described mixture of salt and alum. This we have frequently seen done. The object of the druggist is profit. It would be scarcely worth his while to sell powdered alum for twopence a pound. Gray, in his book, puts it down at one shilling and sixpence a pound. This is ridiculously too high to sell by the pound, but it is generally charged a penny an ounce. The writer, giving this information to his baker, he exclaimed, "You don't say so!--the infamous rogues--why the rascally druggists cheat us before we can cheat our customers!!"</p>
<p>Such being the case, it seems almost inconceivable, that so small a quantity as two ounces of alum in two hundred and eighty pounds of flour, the weight of a sack, should have any effect in bleaching it; especially when we consider that one hundred parts of alum contain but a fraction more than ten parts of alumina, the only constituent in alum, as we are informed, that possesses the property of bleaching. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that alum, though perhaps not by itself, yet in conjunction with other ingredients, has the effect of whitening the bread. A circumstance occurred, which we have from indisputable authority, of a baker leaving out of his dough, by accident, his usual quantity of <emph rend="italic">stuff,</emph> containing not more than two ounces of alum. The consequence was a batch of brown bread, which he was obliged to sell at half price.</p>
<p>Alum, it is true, is used in small quantities--for the most part in quantities too small to affect the health, perhaps, materially; but still, as it only whitens the bread, and makes it otherwise more pleasing 
 
<pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=139"/>

to the eye, while it deteriorates its wholesomeness, and injures its flavour, one would suppose that the great majority of people would prefer home-baked bread, as it is called, or bread without alum. This, however, they do not do; and there is little probability that they ever will. The Londoners in particular do not like home-baked bread. There have been many instances of persons being induced for the sake of their health to eat it for a time, but they always return to the <emph rend="italic">alumed</emph> bread; and we question whether there is a single baker in the metropolis who sells sufficient home-baked bread to support himself and his family.</p>
<p>Formerly every baker was his own mealman or miller. This is the case now in Glasgow, and in other parts of Scotland. The bakers buy their own wheat, and manufacture it into flour at their own mills, which are held by them as joint-stock proprietors.</p>
<p>It seems to be generally agreed, that alum in bread is detrimental to the health of those who consume it. The fact, however, is, that the bakers eat the same bread as their customers; and it appears very improbable, that there should be a set of men who knowingly poison themselves. The following is Dr. Ure's opinion upon the effects of alum eaten in bread:--</p>
<p>"The habitual and daily introduction of a portion of alum into the human stomach," says Dr. Ure, in his Dictionary of Chemistry, "however small, must be prejudicial to the exercise of its functions, and particularly to persons of a bilious and costive habit. And, besides, as the best sweet flour never stands in need of alum, the presence of this salt indicates an inferior and highly acescent food, which cannot fail to aggravate dyspepsia, and which may generate a calculus diathesis in the urinary organs."</p>
<p>To ascertain whether alum is present in bread, crumble a portion when somewhat stale into cold distilled water; then squeeze the mass through a piece of cloth, and pass the liquid through a paper filter. A limpid infusion will thus be obtained. A dilute solution of muriate of baryta, dropped into the filtered infusion, will indicate by a white cloud, more or less heavy, the presence and quantity of alum.</p>
<p>It is said, that to counteract the costive quality of alum, when consumed in large quantities, the bakers frequently use jalap in the composition of their bread. This we do not believe. Dr. Darwin says, that when much alum is used, it may be distinguished by the eye in the place where two loaves have stuck together in the oven: they break from each other with a much smoother surface than those which do not contain alum. We believe this to be correct;--indeed the bakers say, that this is one of their reasons for using alum.</p>
<p>When the statute was enacted by king John for regulating the price of bread, and during many of the subsequent statutes of assize, the baker was his own manufacturer, purchasing his own corn, and having it ground and separated into flour, pollard, and bran. According to Pownalls work on the assize of bread, which we have no 
 
<pb n="140" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=140"/>

doubt is correct, this flour, or the flour from which the bran and pollard only are separated, was found, from an unvaried series of experiments made from age to age, through the course of many hundred years, to be three-fourths in weight of the whole grain of wheat, taking all sorts of wheats together; and the bread made from this flour has always been decreed the standard of the food of bread corn. But, by insensible degrees, the manufacture of bread became separated into two distinct employments. To this cause Mr. Edlin attributes the custom--the pernicious custom, as he considers it--of making bread from other flour than that we have described, which many persons assert is more wholesome and more nutritious than that made of the finest flour. The miller not considering himself liable to the assize laws, made different kinds of flour, some of which was extremely fine and white. The bread made of this flour was so very white, and pleasing to the eye and palate, that in the course of a few years it got into general use, and the people, particularly the Londoners, refused to buy the bread made of the whole of the grain, except the husks, or coarse and fine bran.</p>
<p>To this circumstance, perhaps, may be attributed the almost universal use of alum in bakers' bread not made of the finest flour; and very little of it is so made, for it is impossible from a second flour, which is the flour generally used, to make bread white without the employment of the bleaching properties of this ingredient.</p>
<p>The assize of bread has been for some time abolished, and the baker is entitled to sell his bread for as much as anybody is willing to give for it. There is very properly still a heavy penalty attached to selling bread short of weight.</p>
<p>Potatoes, called by the bakers <emph rend="italic">fruit,</emph> are used by them for the purpose of aiding the fermentation, and, as they say, for the purpose of improving the appearance of the bread, and not for saving flour. Indeed, in the small quantities in which we have seen them used, not more than seven or eight pounds to two hundred and eight pounds of flour, there can be little or nothing gained by them. Potatoes, however, as well as damaged rice, are no doubt used in large quantities by cheap, fraudulent bakers. We utterly disbelieve the stories about bakers using ground bones to adulterate bread, for this reason--namely, that the expense of making them fit for such a purpose would be much greater than the cost of flour itself.</p>
<p>There are instances on record of convictions having been obtained against bakers for using gypsum, chalk, and pipe-clay, in the manufacture of bread.</p>
<p>Carbonate of ammonia, which is sometimes used by bakers in producing light and porous bread from sour or damaged flour, does not appear to be liable to the same objections as those urged against alum; as the action of the former upon the bread is merely mechanical, no part of this salt remaining in bread after it is baked. During the operation of baking, it causes the dough to swell up into air bubbles, which carry before them stiff dough, and thus it renders the 
 
<pb n="141" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=141"/>

dough porous; the salt itself is at the same time totally volatilized, and not a particle remains in the bread. Carbonate of ammonia, however, has not, like alum, the property of bleaching the bread.</p>
<p>It is said, that the carbonate of magnesia of the shops, when well mixed with flour in the proportion of twenty to forty grains to a pound of flour, materially improves it for the purpose of making bread. It is recommended to be employed when the flour is new, or of a bad quality. Mr. Davy, professor of Chemistry, says, that this substance must be most intimately mixed with the flour, previous to laying the sponge; and gives it as his decided opinion, that not the slightest danger can be apprehended from the use of so innocent a substance, in such small quantities as he recommends.</p>

<hd align="center">METHOD OF MAKING BAKERS' BREAD.</hd>
<p>Having briefly described the utensils of a bakehouse, and having descanted at some length (but not longer, it is hoped, than the importance of the subject requires) upon the ingredients used by public bakers in the manufacture of bread, we shall proceed at once to show the methods they generally employ. We must observe, however, that the first method described was witnessed by Mr. Edlin nearly forty years ago; and the second, which is the mode now generally followed, has been witnessed by the writer himself in all its details.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="baker's bread">The Old Method.</alt></purpose>

--To make a sack of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into bread, the baker bakes that quantity of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and empties it into the <implement>kneading trough</implement>--it is then carefully sifted through a <implement>wire sieve,</implement> which makes it lie lighter and reduces any lumps that may have been formed in it. The next process is to dissolve two ounces of <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> technically <emph rend="italic">stuff,</emph> or some call it rocky, in a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> placed over the fire. This is then poured into the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> and four or five pounds of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> are added to it, with a pailful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> pretty hot, but not too much so. When this mixture, technically <emph rend="italic">liquor,</emph> has cooled to the temperature of about 84&#176;, from three to four pints of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> are mixed in it, and the whole having been strained through the <implement>seasoning sieve,</implement> is emptied into a hole made in the mass of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and mixed up with a portion of it to the consistence of thick batter. Dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is then sprinkled over the top. This is called the <emph rend="italic">quarter sponge,</emph> and the operation is denominated setting. The sponge must then be covered up with sacks or woollen cloths to keep it warm, if the weather be cold.</p>
<p>In this situation it is left three or four hours, when it gradually swells and breaks through the dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> laid upon its surface. Another pailful of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> impregnated with <ingredient>alum</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> is now added and well stirred in, and the mass sprinkled with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and covered up as before. This is called setting <emph rend="italic">half sponge.</emph></p>
<p>The whole is then well kneaded, with about two pailsful of more <ingredient>water,</ingredient> for about an hour, when the dough is cut into pieces with a knife; and to prevent it spreading, pinned or kept at one end of the 
 
<pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=142"/>

trough by a <implement>pin board.</implement> In this state it is left to <emph rend="italic">prove,</emph> as the bakers call it, for about four hours. After the proving process is over, the dough is again well kneaded for about half an hour. It is then removed from the inside of the trough to its lid, where it is cut into pieces, and weighed into the quantities suitable for each loaf.</p>
<p>The operation of moulding the dough can be learnt only by practice. It consists in cutting the masses of weighed dough, each into two equal parts. They are then kneaded either round or long, and one placed in a hollow made in the other; and the union is completed by a turn of the knuckles on the centre of the upper piece. The loaves are left in the oven from one hour and a half to two hours. They are then taken out, and, to prevent their splitting, are turned their bottom side upwards. They are afterwards covered up with a blanket to prevent as much as possible evaporation, by which weight is lost, and the bread becomes dry and unpalatable.</p>
<p><attribution>Mr. Edlin</attribution> has made one mistake in the above account; namely, as regards the time when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum</ingredient> are incorporated with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> These ingredients ought never to be put into the sponge. If they were, the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> would retard the fermentation, and this Mr. Accum as a chemist ought to have known, and not, like many others, have copied and adopted Mr. Edlin's error.</p>
<p>With the exception just alluded to, the foregoing mode of making bread was pursued by the bakers some years ago, and is still practised by some of them; but the following is the process now pursued.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="baker's bread">Modern Method.</alt></purpose>

--Take a peck of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> (about eight pounds) and boil them with their skins on--then mash them in the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> add two or three quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> about the same quantity of <ingredient>patent yeast</ingredient> (as directed to be prepared, page 136), and three or four pounds of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> stir together well, and cover the mixture up close with a sack, and let it stand from six to twelve hours, when it will have become what is called ferment. Then empty a sack of second <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into the trough--some sift it in--and take a little less than one quarter of the sack of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and pin or block it up to one end of the trough with the <implement>pin-board.</implement> Then bring the <implement>seasoning tub</implement> with the <emph rend="italic">ferment</emph> in it to the trough, pour in a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>warm water</ingredient>--in summer, cold--stir up the mixture with the hands, and mash any lumps of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> (fruit) that may be in--next, strain it through a sieve for the purpose of separating the skins of the <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> then pour the mixture liquor into the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> which had been previously pinned or blocked up at one end of the trough, and mix it well into the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the hands--sprinkle a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over the top, and let it stand five or six hours, during which time the sponge will have risen twice. The first rising is suffered to break and go down. In about an hour or so, according to the heat of the bakehouse, the sponge rises a second time, and just as it is about again to break, or when the air escapes by the bursting of the bubbles, a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient> (about three pailsful) to make up the batch is poured into the sponge from the <implement>seasoning tub,</implement> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> having dissolved in it previously 
 
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=143"/>

about four pounds of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and eight ounces of what is called stuff--(some use more than a pound or sixteen ounces of stuff). The liquor ought to be well mixed with the sponge; which being done, the <implement>pin-board</implement> is taken away, and the whole of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is well worked up into one mass, which is blocked up by the <implement>pin-board</implement> to one end, and left about an hour in summer, and two hours in winter, to prove; the vacant part of the trough is then sprinkled with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to prevent the dough from sticking, the <implement>pin-board</implement> is knocked out, and the dough is pitched out of the trough on to the lid of the opposite trough, when it is cut into masses and weighed--technically <emph rend="italic">scaled off.</emph> These masses are then moulded into shape and put aside in a regular manner, to be finally moulded into loaves, taking care to mould those first which were first <emph rend="italic">scaled off.</emph> Previous to the moulding, the oven must be well <emph rend="italic">swabbed out,</emph> or cleaned with the <implement>swabber</implement> or <implement>scuttle,</implement> and the up-sets chalked to prevent the bread sticking to them. They are then placed at the back and on each side of the oven by means of the peel; the long loaves, or the quartern and half-quartern bricks, are put into the oven, packed together as close as possible--the common round bread is also packed close--but the cottage bread must be placed separately, each loaf by itself, or it will not be crusted all round. After placing the loaves in the oven, or, as the bakers say, <emph rend="italic">setting the batch,</emph> which requires a good hand to do properly, an up-set is placed in front of it. The <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> for the next <emph rend="italic">ferment</emph> are put into a tin or iron kettle, generally round, but sometimes in the form of a <implement>fish-kettle,</implement> and placed in the oven to boil. When the <ingredient>potatoes are done,</ingredient> and while they are hot, the ferment for the next batch must be mixed. Twenty-four hours elapse from the mixing the ferment to the time when the bread is taken out of the oven.</p>

<hd align="center">SUBSTITUTE FOR WHEAT-FLOUR BREAD.</hd>
<p>Under this head we intend to treat of the various substitutes which have been used at different times, and in different countries, for bread made of wheat flour. We allude to bread made of rye, barley, oats, peas, beans, buckwheat, maize, farinaceous roots, and of mixed substances, &amp;c. This subject is not without interest, independent of utility, and a work of this kind would scarcely be complete if it were not introduced. We shall enter upon it with few general remarks.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Bread Corn.</emph>--properly so called, of which bread is made in this country, and other civilized nations, comprehends the seeds of all cerealia, or farinaceous grass-like plants, for they all contain a farinaceous or mealy substance of a like nature; and which substance is chiefly composed of starch. The seeds or grain in common use are, first and principally, <emph rend="italic">wheat;</emph> second, <emph rend="italic">rye;</emph> and third, <emph rend="italic">barley.</emph></p>
<p>Wheat is the only grain from which really good, porous, or light bread can be made; but rye and barley are occasionally used, as well 
 
<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=144"/>

as other grain. The bread, however, is of an inferior quality. A sort of bread is also made from <emph rend="italic">oats, maize, rice, millet,</emph> &amp;c.</p>
<p>Rice is said, and no doubt truly, to nourish more human beings than all the other seeds together used as food; and it is by many considered the most nutritive of all kinds of grain. Accum, in the <emph rend="italic">Art of making Bread,</emph> says, that "it has been ascertained, that one part of rice contains as much food and useful nourishment as six of wheat;" an assertion by the way which we are much inclined to disbelieve. But be this as it may, there is no doubt that rice makes a very nourishing and healthy food, notwithstanding the prejudices that prevailed against it, on the unfounded allegation that it caused diseases in the eye. Rice is the principal food of most of the eastern nations, a fact which shows that it is not unhealthy. Rice is not, however, often made into bread without the addition of flour, and when it is, it forms a loaf of very inferior quality.</p>
<p>Maize is frequently employed as bread-corn in America, but it will not by itself make good loaf-bread; but unleavened cakes are made of it, very nutritive and palatable.</p>
<p>Oatmeal is seldom used for making loaf-bread, but is extensively used in the north of Great Britain in making unleavened bread, commonly called oat-cakes. It may be observed here, that the objection to biscuits, oat-cakes, maize-cakes, and other unleavened bread, on the ground of their being unhealthy, and of course not nutritive, appears to be without foundation. There can be no doubt, however, that they are inferior as food to good wheaten loaf-bread.</p>
<p>The seeds of leguminous plants, such as pease and beans, are sometimes used as substitutes for bread-corn. They yield a great deal of meal, which is of a sweetish taste, but it forms a coarse bread, and is generally considered neither palatable nor digestible. Dr. Cullen says, that "on certain farms in his country, upon which the leguminous seeds are produced in great abundance, the labouring servants are much fed upon this kind of grain; but if such servants are removed to a farm upon which the <emph rend="italic">leguminous seeds</emph> are not in such plenty, and they are, therefore, fed with the <emph rend="italic">cerealia</emph> (wheat, barley, &amp;c.), they soon find a decay of strength; and it is common for servants, in making such removals, to insist on their being provided daily, or weekly, with a certain quantity of the leguminous meal." It does not, however, follow, that pease or bean-flower bread would be found generally so nutritive or digestible as wheat-flour bread. A great deal may be attributed to habit, and the laborious employment of farmers' servants in the open air.</p>
<p>All the vegetable substances from which bread is made, contain more or less of <emph rend="italic">starch,</emph> or what is otherwise called amylaceous fecula, and this is the most valuable and nutritive part of all such substances, whether they consist of grain, or roots, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We scarcely need observe, that the potatoe, amongst roots, is the most extensively used as a substitute for bread. In many countries, 
 
<pb n="145" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=145"/>

particularly Ireland, it is almost the exclusive food of the poor. The potatoe contains a great deal of starch.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Rice,</emph> notwithstanding its rough and dry qualities, as a farinaceous vegetable, is capable of being converted into bread, without the addition of any other substance. The Americans, however, make bread of rice by washing it in water till perfectly clean. They then, after the rice has been sufficiently drained, put it into a <implement>mortar,</implement> and reduce it while damp into a sort of powder; it is then completely dried, and passed through a <implement>hair-sieve.</implement> The flour thus obtained, it is said, is then generally mixed with a little Indian corn meal, and boiled into a thickish consistence, which is sometimes mixed with boiled potatoes, and fermented and baked in tins, or pans, in the usual manner. The bread, we are told, made in this way, is light and wholesome--"pleasing to the eye, and agreeable to the taste."</p>
<p>But a sort of bread may be made from rice, without the addition of any other kind of meal. Let a sufficient quantity of rice-flour be put into a <implement>kneading trough,</implement> and at the same time let a due proportion of flour be boiled, into which throw a few handsful of rice in the grain, and boil it till it is broken. This compound will form a thick and viscous substance, which is poured upon the flour, and the whole is kneaded with a mixture of salt and yeast, or other fermenting matter. The dough is then covered with flannel or other cloths to keep it warm, and left to rise. This dough, though firm at first, in the course of fermentation becomes as liquid as soup, and is quite incapable of being worked into loaves, in the usual manner, by the hand. The following is the mode by which this difficulty is surmounted:--The oven is heated while the dough is rising; and it being sufficiently hot, the dough is put into a tin pan, which is covered with a paper, or large leaves. The tin is then placed in the oven, and immediately reversed or turned upside down; the heat prevents the dough from spreading, and, in fact, fixes it in that shape given it by the <implement>stewpan</implement> or box. This bread is said to be "both beautiful and good;" but when it gets stale, it becomes very much deteriorated--as indeed does all bread in which there is rice.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Potatoes,</emph> mixed in various proportions with meal, are frequently employed in the making of bread. The London bakers all use them in greater or less quantities--not, as they say, to save flour, but to assist fermentation. There are various ways in which potatoes may be used with meal in the production of bread,--potatoes alone will not make good bread; the potatoe is not of an adhesive quality, and the bread is not only brown and heavy, but crumbles to pieces. M. Parmentier, to render it more adhesive, mixed with the potatoe-meal a decoction of bran, and sometimes honey and water; either of which, he says, much improved it, by rendering it lighter, better coloured, well tasted, and sufficiently consistent.</p>
<p>He obtained also, he adds, well-fermented bread, of a good colour and taste, by mixing some potatoe pulp with meal of wheat, or potatoe-meal, 
 
<pb n="146" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=146"/>

with the addition of yeast and salt. After repeated trials, he recommends, in times of scarcity, a mixture of potatoes with the meal of wheat, in preference to the meal of any other grain. Where no flour or grain can be obtained, Parmentier recommends the use of bread made from the amylaceous (partaking of starch) powder of potatoes,--potatoe pulp, mixed and fermented, with the addition of honey. Potatoes-meal, when mixed with water, acquires a gluey consistence, but bread made from this and the flour of wheat is never of a good colour. That, however, which is made of a mixture of the pulp with the flour of wheat, is much whiter. Parmentier, we are informed, made bread very much resembling that of wheat, by mixing four ounces of amylaceous powder of potatoes, one drachm of mucilage, extracted from barley, one drachm of the bran of rye, and one drachm of glutinous matter, dried and pounded into powder.</p>
<p>A German writer upon country affairs, of the name of Khyogg, who has obtained the name of the Rustic Socrates, recommends, that potatoes well boiled and carefully peeled should be put into a <implement>kneading-trough,</implement> covered with boiling water, and beaten or bruised till they are converted into a kind of soup, throughout of one consistence. This soup may be mixed with the flour of wheat in the proportion of one-fourth, one-third, and even one-half; and if the flour be of good quality, the bread will be found pleasant, nourishing, and wholesome. This is the principal food of the peasantry in German Lorraine, and the people of that country are remarkable for their healthy, robust, and vigorous constitutions; the young men are tall and handsome, and the country is thickly populated.</p>
<p>In Vogstand and in Saxony, potatoes are prepared for bread by peeling them, grating them very fine, and by putting the pulp into a milk-pail, or some other suitable vessel. It is then mixed with cold water, which is allowed to remain upon the pulp twenty-four hours. The water is then drawn off, and other water added, and again drawn till the water comes off quite pure. The potatoe pulp is then drained through a clean cloth, and then spread upon a plate, or some other surface, till dry. After this, it is reduced to a fine powder, mixed with an equal portion of wheat flour, and made into bread by the usual process.</p>
<p>We have thought it right to lay before our readers the various ways in which it has been recommended to employ potatoes in making bread in times of scarcity; but after all, our own opinion is, that the best and most economical mode of using potatoes is simply to boil them as they do in Ireland, where, it is much to be regretted, they stand instead of all other food to the mass of the population.</p>
<p>Many other substances have been employed in making bread other than those of the flour of farinaceous vegetables, such as wheat, barley, rye, Indian-corn, oats, &amp;c. The latter grain makes an excellent unleavened bread, and is much eaten in Scotland, Lancashire, and several of the northern English counties. It is called oat-cake, and is preferred by many persons to wheaten bread.</p>
 
<pb n="147" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=147"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Bread made of Roots.</emph>--M. Parmentier, late chief Apothecary in the Hotel des Invalides, whose authority we have before quoted, has published numerous and very curious experiments on the vegetables, which in times of scarcity might be used in the subsistence of animals, as substitutes for those usually employed for that purpose. The result of these experiments in the mind of M. Parmentier was, that starch is the nutritive part of farinaceous vegetables, and that the farina of plants was identical with the starch of wheat. The plants from which he extracted this farina are the bryony, the iris, gladiolus, ranunculus, fumaria, arum, dracunculus, mandragora, colchicum, filipendula, helleborus, and the roots of the gramen caninum arvense, or dog grass of the fields.</p>
<p>The mode employed by M. Parmentier to extract the starch, or farina, from these vegetables, was merely bruising and boiling. The roots were cleansed and scraped, then reduced to a pulp, which being soaked in a considerable quantity of water, a white sediment is deposited, which when properly washed and dried will be found to be pure starch. M. Parmentier converted this starch into bread by mingling it with an equal quantity of potatoes reduced to a pulp, and employing the usual quantity of yeast or other leaven. The bread, we are informed, had no bad taste, and was of excellent quality.</p>
<p>From these experiments of M. Parmentier, it appears, that it is chiefly the amylaceous matter or starch of grain that is nutritious; and, that the nutritive quality of other vegetable substances depends in a great measure on the quantity of that matter which they contain. Starch formed into a jelly, and diffused in water, will keep a long time without change.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Ragwort.</emph>--Bread has been made in times of scarcity from the roots of this plant. When ragwort root is first taken out of the ground, it is soft and viscous, but becomes hard in a short time, and may be preserved in that state for years without being at all deteriorated, providing it be kept in a dry, airy place. When this root is ground and reduced to flour, which it may easily be, it has an agreeable nut-like taste. It is said to be easily digested when made into bread, and to be more nutritive and "exhilarating," than wheaten bread. The same properties and effects are attributed to radishes, but we apprehend not truly.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Turnip Bread</purpose>

--is made of <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> mixed with equal quantities of <ingredient>wheat flour.</ingredient> The <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> must be first washed clean, then pared and boiled. Mash them and press the <ingredient>water</ingredient> out of them--at least the greater part. Mix with an equal quantity in weight of <ingredient>coarse meal flour</ingredient>--make the dough in the usual manner, and when risen, form it into loaves, and bake it rather more than ordinary bread; when taken from the oven it will be light and sweet, with a little taste of the <ingredient>turnip.</ingredient> "After it has been allowed to stand," says our authority, "twelve hours, the taste of the <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> is scarcely perceptible, and the smell is quite gone. After an interval of twenty-four hours, it

We are of opinion, however, that it cannot be so good as wheat bread; for, independent of other considerations, <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> do not contain so much starch or nutritive matter as <ingredient>wheat.</ingredient></p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Apple Bread.</purpose>

--A bread said to be very superior to potatoe bread has been made from the use of common <ingredient>apples</ingredient> with meal. Boil one-third of peeled <ingredient>apples;</ingredient> while quite warm, bruise them into two-thirds of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> including the proper quantity of leaven, or <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> knead without <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the juice of the fruit being quite sufficient. When this mixture has acquired the consistency of paste, put it into a vessel to rise for about twelve hours. By this process may be obtained a very sweet bread, full of eyes and extremely light.</p>
</recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">Meslin Bread.</emph>--A good bread is made in many parts of England from what is called meslin, which is a mixture of rye and wheat. This is raised on one and the same ground at the same time, and passes through the processes of reaping, thrashing, grinding, and dressing, in the mixed state.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Salep Bread.</purpose>

--<attribution>Dr. Percival</attribution> recommends the employment of <ingredient>orchis root in powder,</ingredient> or, as it is called, <ingredient>salep.</ingredient> He says, that an ounce of salep, dissolved in a quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and mixed with two pounds of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> two ounces of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and eighty grains of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> produced a remarkably good loaf, weighing three pounds two ounces; while a loaf made of an equal quantity of the other ingredients, without the salep, or powdered orchis root, weighed but two pounds twelve ounces. If the salep be in too large quantities, its peculiar taste will be distinguishable in the bread.</p>
</recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">Oat and Barley Bread.</emph>--The Norwegians, we are informed, make bread of barley and oatmeal baked between two stones. This bread, it is added, improves by age, and may be kept thirty or forty years!! At their great festivals, they use their oldest bread; and it is not unusual, at the baptism of a child, to have bread that was baked at the baptism of the grandfather.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Debretzen Bread.</purpose>

--In some parts of Hungary, Debretzen for instance, they have a peculiar mode of fermenting bread without yeast, by means of a leaven made in the following manner. Two large handsful of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> are boiled in four quarts of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> this decoction is poured upon as much <ingredient>wheaten bran</ingredient> as it will moisten, and to this are added four or five pounds of <ingredient>leaven.</ingredient> When the mass is warm, the ingredients are well worked together, so as to be thoroughly mixed. It is then deposited in a warm place for twenty-four hours, and afterwards divided into small pieces, about the size of hens' eggs, which are dried by being placed upon a board and exposed to dry air, but not to the sun; when dry, they are laid up for use, and may be kept for six months.</p>
 
<pb n="149" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=149"/>

<p>The following is given as the mode by which bread is made from the above-described ferment. For baking six large loaves, six good handsful of these balls are dissolved in seven or eight quarts of <ingredient>warm water</ingredient>--this mixture is poured through a sieve at one end of the <implement>bread-trough,</implement> and after it three quarts of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> the remaining mass being well pressed out. The liquor is mixed up with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> sufficient to form one large loaf; they then strew this mass over with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> the sieve with its contents is put upon it, and the whole is covered up and kept warm and left to rise, or till the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> upon it begins to crack. Fifteen quarts of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> in which six handsful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> have been dissolved, are then poured upon it through the sieve; the necessary quantity of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is added, and the whole is well kneaded together. The dough is then covered up and kept warm for half an hour. It is then formed into loaves which are kept for another half hour in a warm room; and after that they are put into an oven, where they remain for two or three hours according to their size.</p>
<p>There is certainly an advantage in this kind of ferment--which is, its capability of keeping for a long time, and of being made in large quantities. On this account it would be convenient on board of ships, or in the camp of an army.</p>
</recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">Millet Bread.</emph>--Bread made of millet, if eaten when warm, is pretty palatable, but when cold, it becomes dry and crumbly. Besides, though nutritive when boiled, it is not so in bread, but becomes a very powerful astringent. According to Pliny, however, it would appear, that millet was in very general use as food in Italy among the peasantry. "There is no grain," he says, "more heavy, or which swells more in baking." Probably the Italians had some method for counteracting its astringent properties. It is said to be an excellent leaven, and has been recommended for malting.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">The Bread Tree.</emph>--Various substances have been employed in different parts of the world as substitutes for making bread, in the absence of farinaceous or flour-yielding vegetables. The bread tree, or rather the fruit of this tree, ranks first among the substances alluded to. The bread tree is common in many parts of the east. It is very abundant at Surinam, where extensive avenues may be seen of it, loaded with luxuriant crops of fruit. As a brief account of this extraordinary tree cannot fail to be interesting to our readers (previous to giving a description of the mode of preparing the fruit for food), we beg to lay before them the following remarks and extracts.</p>
<p>All the species of the bread fruit tree, of which there are eight, are natives of the South Sea islands. More than one hundred and fifty years ago, this tree had excited great interest amongst Europeans, and particularly amongst the people of Great Britain. Dampier, who performed his voyage round the world in 1688, thus describes it:--</p>
<p>"The bread fruit as we call it, grows on a large tree as big and high as our largest apple trees; it hath a spreading head, full of branches and dark leaves. The fruit grows on the boughs like apples; it is as big as a penny loaf when wheat is at five shillings the bushel; it is of a round shape, and hath a thick tough rind. When the fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant. The natives of Guam use it for bread. They gather it when it is full grown, while it is green and hard; then they bake it in an oven, which scorcheth the rind and maketh it black; but they scrape off the black crust, and there remains a tender thin crust; and the inside is soft, tender, and white, like the crumb of a penny loaf. There is neither <emph rend="italic">core</emph> nor <emph rend="italic">stone</emph> in the inside, but all is of a pure substance like bread. It must be eaten new, for if kept more than twenty-four hours, it becomes hard and choaky; but it is very pleasant before it is too stale. This fruit lasts in season eight months in the year; during which the natives eat no other sort of bread kind. I did never see this fruit anywhere but here. The natives told us there was plenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the Ladrone islands; and I did never hear of it anywhere else."</p>
<p>So much for Dampier's account, which, however, does not appear to be quite correct. The great circumnavigator, Cook, thus describes the fruit in question:--"It grows on a tree about the size of a middling oak. Its leaves are frequently a foot and a half long, of an oblong shape, deeply sinuated like those of the fig-tree, which they resemble in consistence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the size and shape of a child's head, and the surface is reticulated, not much unlike a truffle. It is covered with a thin skin, and hath a core about as big as the handle of a small knife. The eatable part lies between the skin and the core. It is as white as snow, and somewhat of the consistence of new bread. It must be roasted before it is eaten; being divided into three or four parts. Its taste is insipid, with a slight 
 
<pb n="152" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=152"/>

sourness, somewhat resembling that of the crumb of wheaten bread mixed with a Jerusalem artichoke."</p>
<p>The above is the sober and satisfactory account of the bread tree and its fruit, as given by the illustrious Cook. Dr. Hawkesworth's description of its advantages is amusing, but extravagant. He says, "if a man plants ten bread fruit trees in his lifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfil his duty to his own and future generations, as the natives of our less temperate climate can by ploughing in the cold winter, and reaping in the summer's heat, as often as those seasons return. Even if, after he has procured bread for his present household, he should convert the surplus into money, and lay it up for his children."</p>
<p>The bread fruit tree has been planted in some of the West India colonies, but with little success as to any advantages to be derived from it. Indeed, its fruit appears to us to have been greatly exaggerated with respect to its beneficial application as food for the use of man. It has been observed, however, that "even in those colonies into which the bread fruit has not been generally introduced as an article of food, it is used as a delicacy; or whether employed as bread, or in the form of pudding, it is considered as highly palatable by the European inhabitants."</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Bread Fruit Bread.</purpose>

--To prepare the fruit for use instead of bread, it must be roasted, either whole, or cut into three or four pieces. It is also cooked in an oven, which renders it soft, and something like a boiled potatoe; not quite so mealy as a good one, but more so than those of an inferior description. The Otaheitans make three dishes of it, by putting either <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or the <ingredient>milk of cocoa-nut</ingredient> to it, then beating it to a paste with a stone <implement>pestle,</implement> and afterwards mixing it with ripe <ingredient>plantains,</ingredient> <ingredient>bananas,</ingredient> or <ingredient>mahie.</ingredient></p>
<p>This mahie is a preparation of the ripe <ingredient>bread fruit,</ingredient> for which it is substituted during the season, just before gathering a fresh crop. It is made thus:--The fruit is gathered just before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in heaps, is closely covered with leaves; in this state it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes disagreeably sweet. The core is then taken out entire, by gently pulling the stalk, and the fruit is thrown into a hole which is dug for that purpose, generally in the houses, and neatly lined in the bottom and sides with grass; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy stones laid upon them. In this state it undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes sour; after which it undergoes no change for many months. It is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for use, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves, and roasted or baked. After it is baked, it will keep five or six weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives seldom make a meal without it. To Europeans, however, the taste is said to be as disagreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the first time it is eaten.</p>

<p><purpose rend="italic">Sago Bread</purpose>

--is made from the <ingredient>wood of the sago tree,</ingredient> in the following 
 
<pb n="153" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=153"/>

manner:--The natives of the islands of Barida and Amboyna saw the body of the tree into small pieces, and, after bruising and beating them in a <implement>mortar,</implement> pour <ingredient>water</ingredient> upon the fragments. This is left for some hours undisturbed, to let the pithy farinaceous matter subside. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> is then poured off, and the meal, being properly dried, is formed into cakes, or fermented and made into bread, which, it is said, is nearly as palatable as wheaten bread. The Hottentots make a kind of bread from another species of sago tree. The pith of this tree is collected, and tied up in dressed calf, or sheep-skin, and then buried in the ground for several weeks, which renders it mellow and tender. It is then made into cakes, which are baked under hot embers. Others roast the <ingredient>sago tree pith,</ingredient> and make it into a kind of porridge.</p>
</recipe>

<p>The sago of commerce is made from the pith of this tree, but it is granulated by passing it through a sieve. It acquires its brown colour from drying it on hot stones.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Casava Bread</purpose>

--is made in the Caribbee Islands, from a very poisonous root called <ingredient rend="italic">Jatropa Maniat,</ingredient> rendered wholesome by the extraction of its acrid <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> which the Indians use for poisoning their arrows. So powerfully poisonous is this <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> that a tea-spoonful is sufficient to take away the life of a man. The <ingredient>root of the <emph rend="italic">maniat,</emph></ingredient> after being washed, scraped clean, and grated in a tub, is enclosed in a sack made of rushes, of very loose texture. This sack is suspended upon a stick placed upon two wooden forks. A heavy vessel is suspended to the bottom of the sack, and is so contrived as to press the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> out of the roots. When the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> is all taken from the roots, they become a sort of starch, which is exposed to smoke in order to dry it; when well dried, it is passed through a sieve: it is now called casava. It is baked into cakes by laying it on hot plates of iron, or on hot earth. The article called <emph rend="italic">tapioca</emph> is the finest part of casava, collected and formed into small tears, by straining the mass, while it is still moist, so as to make it into small irregular lumps.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Plantain Bread</purpose>

--is made from the fruit of the <ingredient>plantain</ingredient> tree. This fruit is about a foot long, and from an inch and a half to two inches in diameter, and has a tough skin, within which there is a soft pulp, of a sweet flavour. The fruit is generally cut when green; the skin is taken off, and the heart is roasted in a clear cold fire for a few minutes: it is then scraped, and served up as bread. This tree is a native of the East Indies, and other parts of the Asiatic continent, but is cultivated on an extensive scale in Jamaica. It is said, that without this fruit the West India islands would be scarcely inhabitable, as no species of provisions could supply its place. Wheaten bread flour is not so agreeable to the negroes, and they greatly prefer it to the fruit of the bread tree.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Banana Bread</purpose>

--is made of the fruit of the <ingredient>banana</ingredient> tree. This fruit is about four or five inches long, of the shape of a cucumber, and of a highly grateful flavour. They grow in bunches that weigh twelve 
 
<pb n="154" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=conf&#38;PageNum=154"/>

pounds and upwards. The pulp of the <ingredient>banana</ingredient> tree is softer than that of the plantain tree, and of a more luscious taste. When ripe it is a very pleasant food, either undressed, or fried in slices like fritters. All classes of people in the West Indies are very fond of it. When preparing for a voyage, they take the ripe fruit and squeeze it through a sieve; then form the mass into loaves, which are dried in the sun, or baked on hot ashes, having been previously wrapped up in leaves.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Moss Bread,</purpose>

or bread made of moss, is prepared from a species of the tribe <emph rend="italic">lichen,</emph> called <ingredient>rein-deer moss,</ingredient> which contains a considerable quantity of starch. The Icelanders form the <emph rend="italic">lichen islandicus</emph> into bread, and it is said to be very nutritive. The moss is collected in the summer, dried, and ground into powder--of which bread gruel and pottage are made. It is also boiled in <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>whey,</ingredient> till it comes to a jelly. It should be previously steeped some hours in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> in order to extract the bitter matter with which it is impregnated, which is not only disagreeable as to taste, but is also a purgative.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose rend="italic">Dried Fish Bread.</purpose>

--We have shown that a great variety of substances are used as substitutes for flour bread. We now come to <ingredient>dried fish,</ingredient> which appears to be an odd thing to make bread of. In Iceland, Lapland, Crim Tartary, and other parts of the north, a kind of bread is made of <ingredient>dried fish,</ingredient> beaten first into powder, sometimes with the <ingredient>inner bark of trees,</ingredient> and then made up into cakes.</p>
</recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">Earth Bread.</emph>--But the strangest substitute for corn bread that has ever been employed, is a kind of white earth found in Upper Lusatia, of which the poor in times of scarcity have frequently made bread. This bread earth, if we may so designate it, is dug out of a hill where salt-petre had formerly been worked. When heated by the sun it cracks, and small globules proceed from it like meal, which ferment when mixed with flour. It is said on good authority, that on this earth, made into bread, many persons have subsisted for a considerable time. An earth very similar is found in Catalonia.</p>
