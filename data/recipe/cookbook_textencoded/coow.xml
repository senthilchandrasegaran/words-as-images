<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>THE cook exercises a greater power over the public health and welfare than the physician, and if he should be a charlatan in his art, alas! for his employers. Hitherto, or until of late years, the cook has had to educate himself, while the physician appropriates all the knowledge of antiquity, and of every succeeding age; his individual cases are all classed according to general principles, while the rules that have regulated the preparation of our food, have been discordant and unnatural. In the present age, indeed, cookery has been raised to the dignity of an art, and sages have given their treatises to the world. V&#232;ry has a monument in the cemetery of P&#232;re La Chaise, among the tombs of warriors, poets, and philosophers, recording of his life that 'it was consecrated to the useful arts.' Virgil however, writes that the best delights of Elysium were showered upon those who received wounds for their country, who lived unspotted priests, who uttered verses worthy of Apollo, or who, like V&#232;ry, consecrated their lives to the useful arts. On the utilitarian principle the cook should be much elevated in public estimation, and were he to form a strict alliance with the physician, the patriarchal ages would return, and men would die of nothing but sheer old age.</p>
<p>After insanity, the most grievous affliction of Providence, or rather of improvidence and imprudence, is Dyspepsy: a malady that under different names has decimated the inhabitants of civilized countries, and of almost all countries, in which man is a 'cooking animal.' To the dyspeptic, the sun has no cheering ray, the air no elasticity or balm; the flowers are without fragrance, music is without melody, and beauty without charms. Life is a blank; affection has lost its power to soothe, and the blessings scattered by Providence, are converted into ministers of torment. Food becomes a bane; the very staff that supports life, gives the flagellation that renders life a curse. All that can delight is lost,--but all that can depress and sting, has a tenfold activity and power.</p>
 
<pb n="iv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=10"/>

<p>The dyspeptic's 'May of life, has fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf.' Sleep that should visit every pillow but that of guilt, is to him no friend; if he slumbers, it is to dream, like Clarence, of hideous forms of suffering, and to wake to their reality. This is but a faint picture of Dyspepsy.</p>
<p align="center">'Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,<lb/>Shades every flower and darkens every green,<lb/>Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,<lb/>And breathes a browner horror on the woods.'</p>
<p>This malady is beyond the science of the physician, but within the art of the cook; in the proverb, Doctor Diet is ranked above Doctor Quiet and Doctor Merryman; though all are good.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Abernethy referred almost all maladies to the stomach, and seldom prescribed any remedy but a proper diet. This it is the province of the cook to provide; and the design of this book to indicate. The work is not designed to spread a taste for pernicious luxuries: and every recipe has been sanctioned by custom. The responsibility of the cook is lightened, and his duty facilitated. He has here a dictionary of reference, an encyclopedia of his art. The details are full, and the authority is perfect. There were various works of merit that it was useful for the cook to study, but here are collected the best parts of all, with the convenience of alphabetical arrangement, and in the compass of a moderate volume. If it is a sin to waste the best gifts of Providence, it should be little less than a felony to spoil them. When we have collected the materials for a house, we never trust the building to an unskilful architect: yet we are often obliged to commit the preparation of our feasts as well as of our common food, to agents without knowledge. This knowledge is now supplied.</p>
<p>More than health depends on the proper preparation of food: our very virtues are the creatures of circumstances, and many a man has hardened his heart, or given up a good resolution, under the operation of indigestion. Who that knows the world, ever solicits with confidence a friendly or charitable act of another before dinner.</p>
<p>The natural and moral world world are reciprocally dependent; soul and body are so linked, that when one loses its tone the other is deprived of its equanimity. The system of morals therefore becomes identified with that of cookery, and the great English moralist, who was learned in both systems, thus spoke of the connexion; 'Some people' said Doctor Johnson, 'have a foolish way of not minding, or of pretending not to mind, what they eat. I for my part mind my belly very studiously, and very carefully, and I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind any thing else.'</p>
 
<pb n="v" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=11"/>

<p>It has been the study of the author, to make every recipe plain, and the proportions certain; little is left to discretion, that could be reduced to measure. The system of confectionery is perfect; and if strictly followed every cook may become a first rate confectioner. Labor, care, and expense have been bestowed upon the work, and the publishers feel so secure of its merit, and of the public want of such a book, that they have caused it to be stereotyped. This would have been hazardous with a novel or almost any literary work; but the number of those who eat is far greater than of those who read. A good book few can estimate; all can enjoy a good dinner, and the publishers anticipate a proportionate encouragement.</p>
<p>Having devised this work for families, we hope that it may offend no one, that we give a word of counsel to domestics: our book may be every way good, yet will its usefulness be much impaired if domestics are not docile and faithful.</p>
<p>We have fortunately, in this country, but one class of people: all are free, and all are politically equal. Our domestics are in New England designated as <emph rend="italic">help</emph>, to indicate that they are the equals, and assistants, rather than the inferiors of their employers. Yet the feeling of independence may be carried too far, and it may be ungraciously expressed. There is no disgrace, and there should be no shame in filling well a subordinate station; the hired ploughman, maid, or cook are not, in an offensive sense, any more the <emph rend="italic">servants</emph> of their employers, than the merchant and the lawyer. All these engage to perform certain services for an equivalent, and it is the duty of all to do them faithfully.</p>
<p>The number of domestics is very large--perhaps the average is five to four families--and it may be even greater. Yet, unfortunately for their welfare, interest, or character, they are almost constantly shifting, and in few families do they remain long. In England, a good domestic is often provided for during life, and it is a desirable situation. It might be so here, if our domestics would strive to accommodate themselves to their situation. There is hardly a family, in which a kind, respectful, and faithful domestic might not be retained for years, and at the best wages. Here then is a home, comfort, and friends. Yet the greater number are contented to live a few months in a place, till the best years of life have slipped away, without provision for age, and without friends, or home. The proverb of the rolling stone contains the best lesson for domestics.</p>
<p>Service in any department is no sacrifice of independence. A domestic is in all things as free as any other class, but it is a bad kind of independence that would lead one, when desired to do a 
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=12"/>

thing in the line of a common employment, to do it ungraciously, and rather as an irksome or unjust task, than as a duty.</p>
<p>Minor vexations, frequently repeated, are equal to greater individual calamities; as many small enjoyments constitute much of the pleasures of life. Around the social board every member of the family is collected thrice at least in twenty-four hours. Thither the head of the family returns from the labors or cares of his business to recruit his strength and to relax his mind. If he return to a table constantly and invariably ill spread; to a dinner to which he could invite no friend, and in which he can have no enjoyment; a cloud will gather on the calmest brow, and a feeling of dissatisfaction may be extended to other things. It is not beneath the solicitude of a good wife, who would not suffer any abatemen in the affection of which she is the object, diligently to study this book, and constantly to provide a neat and well dressed repast.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">MANAGEMENT OF FAMILIES.</hd>
<p>IN domestic arrangement the table is entitled to no small share of attention, as a well conducted system of domestic management is the foundation of every comfort; and the respectability and welfare of families depend in a great measure on the prudent conduct of the female, whose province it is to manage the domestic concerns.</p>
<p>However the fortunes of individuals may support a large expenditure, it will be deficient in all that can benefit or grace society, and in every thing essential to moral order and rational happiness, if not conducted on a regular system, embracing all the objects of such a situation.</p>
<p>In domestic management, as in education, so much must depend on the particular circumstances of every case, that it is impossible to lay down a system which can be generally applicable.</p>
<p>The immediate plan of every family must be adapted to its own peculiar situation, and can only result from the good sense and early good habits of the parties, acting upon general rational principles.</p>
<p>What one family is to do, must never be measured by what another family does. Each one knows its own resources, and should consult them alone. What might be meanness in one, might be extravagance in another, and therefore there can be no standard of reference but that of individual prudence. The most fatal of all things to private families, is to indulge an ambition to make an appearance above their fortunes, professions, or business, whatever these may be.</p>
<p>The next point, both for comfort and respectability, is, that all the household economy should be uniform, not displaying a parade of show in one thing, and a total want of comfort in another. Besides the contemptible appearance that this must have to every person of good sense, it is productive of consequences, not only of present, but future injury to a family, that are too often irreparable.</p>
<p>In great cities in particular, how common is it that for the vanity of having a showy drawing-room to receive company, the family are confined to a close back room, where they have scarcely either air or light, the want of which must materially prejudice their health.</p>
<p>To keep rooms for show, where the fortune is equal to having a house that will accommodate the family properly, and admit of this also, belongs to the highest sphere of life; but in private families, to shut up the only room perhaps in the house which is really wholesome for the family to live in, is inflicting a kind of lingering 
 
<pb n="viii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=14"/>

murder upon the inmates; and yet how frequently this consideration escapes persons who mean well by their family, but who still have a grate, a carpet, and chairs, too fine for every day's use.</p>
<p>Another fruit of this evil is, seeing more company, and in a more expensive manner than is compatible with the general convenience of the family, introducing with it an expense in dress, and a dissipation of time, from which it suffers in various ways.</p>
<p>Social intercourse is not improved by parade, but quite the contrary; real friends, and the pleasantest kind of acquaintance, those who like to be sociable, are repulsed by it. It is a failure therefore every way--the loss of what is really valuable, and an abortive attempt to be fashionable.</p>
<p>A fundamental error in domestic life of very serious extent, involving no less the comfort than the health of the family, arises from the ignorance or mistaken notions of the mistress of the house upon the subjects of diet and cookery.</p>
<p>The subject of cookery is thought by too many women to be below their attention, or, when practically engaged in, it is with no other consideration about it than, in the good housewife's phrase, to make the most of every thing, whether good, bad, or indifferent; or to contrive a thousand mischievous compositions, both savory and sweet, to recommend their own ingenuity.</p>
<p>If cookery is worth studying, as a sensual gratification, it is surely much more so as a means of securing one of the greatest of human blessings--good health; and we cannot quit this part of the subject of domestic management without observing, that one cause of a great deal of injurious cookery originates in the same vanity of show that is productive of so many other evils. In order to set out a table with a greater number of dishes than the situation of the family requires, more cookery is often undertaken than there are servants to do it well, or conveniences in the kitchen for the purpose. Thus some viands are done before they are wanted for serving up, and stand by spoiling, to make room for others; these are again perhaps to be succeeded by something else; and too often are things served up that had better be thrown away, than to be used for food.</p>
<p>The leading consideration about food ought always to be its wholesomeness. Cookery may produce savory and pretty looking dishes without their possessing any of the qualities of food. It is at the same time both a serious and ludicrous reflection that it should be thought to do honor to our friends and ourselves to set out a table where indigestion and all its train of evils, such as fever, rheumatism, gout, and the whole catalogue of human diseases lie lurking in almost every dish. Yet this is both done, and taken as a compliment. We have indeed the "unbought grace of polished society, where gluttony loses half its vice by being stripped of its grossness." When a man at a public house dies of a surfeit of beef steak and porter, who does not exclaim, what a beast!</p>

<p>How infinitely preferable is a dinner of far less show where nobody need be afraid of what they are eating! and such a one will be genteel and respectable. If a person can give his friend only a leg of mutton, there is nothing to be ashamed of in it, provided it is a good one, and well dressed.</p>
<p>A house fitted up with plain good furniture, the kitchen furnished with clean wholesome-looking cooking utensils, good fires, in grates that give no anxiety lest a good fire should spoil them, clean good table linen, the furniture of the table and <implement>sideboard</implement> good of the kind, without ostentation, and a well-dressed plain dinner, bespeak a sound judgment and correct taste in a private family, that place it on a footing of respectability with the first characters in the country. It is only the conforming to our sphere, not the vainly attempting to be above it, that can command true respect.</p>
</div>
<div type="other">
<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">COOKING UTENSILS.</hd>
<p>The various utensils used for the preparation and keeping of food are made either of metal, glass, pottery ware, or wood; each of which is better suited to some particular purposes than the others. Metallic utensils are quite unfit for many uses, and the knowledge of this is necessary to the preservation of health in general, and sometimes to the prevention of immediate dangerous consequences.</p>
<p>The metals commonly used in the construction of these vessels are silver, copper, brass, tin, iron, and lead. Silver is preferable to all the others, because it cannot be dissolved by any of the substances used as food. Brimstone unites with silver, and forms a thin brittle crust over it, that gives it the appearance of being tarnished, which may be accidentally taken with food; but this is not particularly unwholesome, nor is it liable to be taken often, nor in large quantities. The discoloring of silver spoons used with eggs arises from the brimstone contained in eggs.--Nitre or saltpetre has also a slight effect upon silver, but nitre and silver seldom remain long enough together in domestic uses to require any particular caution.</p>
<p>Copper and brass are both liable to be dissolved by vinegar, acid fruits, and pearl-ash. Such solutions are highly poisonous, and great caution should be used to prevent accidents of the kind. Vessels made of these metals are generally tinned, that is, lined with a thin coating of a mixed metal, containing both tin and lead. Neither acids, nor any thing containing pearl-ash, should ever be suffered to remain above an hour in vessels of this kind, as the tinning is dissolvable by acids, and the coating is seldom perfect over the surface of the copper or brass.</p>
<p>The utensils made of what is called block tin are constructed of iron plates coated with tin. This is equally to be dissolved as the tinning of copper or brass vessels, but iron is not an unwholesome 
 
<pb n="x" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=16"/>

substance, if even a portion of it should be dissolved and mixed in the food. Iron is therefore one of the safest metals for the construction of culinary utensils; and the objection to its more extensive use only rests upon its liability to rust, so that it requires more cleaning and soon decays. Some articles of food, such as quinces, orange peel, artichokes, &#38;c. are blackened by remaining in iron vessels, which therefore must not be used for them.</p>
<p>Leaden vessels are very unwholesome, and should never be used for milk and cream, if it be ever likely to stand till it become sour. They are unsafe also for the purpose of keeping salted meats.</p>
<p>The best kind of pottery ware is oriental china, because the glazing is a perfect glass, which cannot be dissolved, and the whole substance is so compact that liquid cannot penetrate it. Many of the English pottery wares are badly glazed, and as the glazing is made principally of lead, it is necessary to avoid putting vinegar, and other acids into them. Acids and greasy substances penetrate into unglazed wares, excepting the strong <implement>stone ware;</implement> or into those of which the glazing is cracked, and hence give a bad flavor to any thing they are used for afterwards. They are quite unfit therefore for keeping pickles or salted meats. Glass vessels are infinitely preferable to any pottery ware but oriental china, and should be used whenever the occasion admits of it.</p>
<p>Wooden vessels are very proper for the keeping many articles of food, and should always be preferred to those lined with lead. If any substance has fermented or become putrid in a wooden <implement>cask</implement> or <implement>tub,</implement> it is sure to taint the vessel so as to make it liable to produce a similar effect upon any thing that may be put into it in future. It is useful to char the insides of these wooden vessels before they are used, by burning wood shavings in them, so as to coat the insides with a crust of charcoal.</p>
<p>As whatever contaminates food in any way must be sure, from the repetition of its baneful effects, to injure the health, a due precaution with respect to all culinary vessels is necessary for its more certain preservation. There is a kind of hollow iron ware lined with enamel, which is superior to every other utensil for sauces or preserves: indeed it is preferable for every purpose.</p>
</div>
<div type="other">
<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">DIET.</hd>
<p>That we require food, as vegetables require water, to support our existence, is the primary consideration upon which we should take it. But in our general practice of eating, it cannot be said, "we eat to live," but are living passages or channels, through which we are constantly propelling both solids and fluids, for the sake of pleasing our palates, at the severe cost often of our whole system.</p>
 
<pb n="xi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=17"/>

<p>A reasonable indulgence in the abundant supplies of nature, converted by art to the purposes of wholesome food, is one of the comforts added to the maintenance of life. It is an indiscriminate gratification of our tastes, regardless of the consequences that may ensue from it, that is alone blamable. But so great is our general apathy in these respects, that even on the occurrence of diseases, from which we are all more or less sufferers, we scarcely ever reflect on our diet, as the principal, if not the sole cause of them. We assign them to weather, to infection, to hereditary descent, to spontaneous breeding, as if a disease could originate without a cause; or to any frivolous imaginary source, without suspecting, or being willing to own, mismanagement of ourselves.</p>
<p>We derive the renewal of our blood and juices, which are constantly exhausting, from the substances we take as food. As our food, therefore, is proper or improper, too much or too little, so will our blood and juices be good or bad, overcharged or deficient, and our state of health accordingly good or diseased.</p>
<p>By aliment, or food, is to be understood whatever we eat or drink, including seasonings; such as salt, sugar, spices, vinegar, &#38;c. &#38;c. Every thing, in short, which we receive into our stomachs. Our food, therefore, consists not only of such particles as are proper for the nourishment and support of the human body, but likewise contains certain active principles, viz. salts, oils, and spirits, which have the properties of stimulating the solids, quickening the circulation, and making the fluids thinner; thus rendering them more suited to undergo the necessary secretions of the body.</p>
<p>The art of preserving health, and obtaining long life, therefore consists in the use of a moderate quantity of such diet as shall neither increase the salts and oils, so as to produce disease, nor diminish them, so as to suffer the solids to become relaxed.</p>
<p>It is very difficult, almost impossible, to ascertain exactly what are the predominant qualities either in our bodies or in the food we eat. In practice, therefore, we can have no other rule but observing by experience what it is that hurts or does us good; and what it is our stomach can digest with facility, or the contrary. But then we must keep our judgment unbiassed, and not suffer it to become a pander to the appetite, and thus betray the stomach and health, to indulge our sensuality.</p>
<p>The eating too little is hurtful, as well as eating too much. Neither excess, nor hunger, nor any thing else that passes the bounds of nature, can be good to man.</p>
<p>By loading the stomach, fermentation is checked, and of course digestion impeded; for the natural juice of the stomach has not room to exert itself, and it therefore nauseates its contents, is troubled with eructations, the spirits are oppressed, obstructions ensue, and fever is the consequence. Besides, that when thus overfilled, the stomach presses on the diaphragm, prevents the proper play of the lungs, and occasions uneasiness in our breathing. 
 
<pb n="xii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=18"/>

Hence arise various ill symptoms and depraved effects throughout the body, enervating the strength, decaying the senses, hastening old age, and shortening life. Though these effects are not immediately perceived, yet they are certain attendants of intemperance; for it has been generally observed in great eaters, that, though from custom, a state of youth, and a strong constitution, they have no present inconvenience, but have digested their food, suffered surfeit, and borne their immoderate diet well; if they have not been unexpectedly cut off, they have found the symptoms of old age come on early in life, attended with pains and innumerable disorders.</p>
<p>If we value our health, we must ever make it a rule not to eat to satiety or fulness, but desist while the stomach feels quite easy. Thus we shall be refreshed, light, and cheerful; not dull, heavy, or indisposed. Should we ever be tempted to eat too much at one time, we should eat the less at another. Thus, if our dinner has been larger than usual, let our supper be less, or rather quite omitted; for there is no man, however careful of his health, who does not occasionally transgress in this way.</p>
<p>With regard to the times of eating, they must to a certain degree be conformed to family convenience, but ought to be quite independent of the caprices of fashion. The great things to be guarded against are, either eating too soon after a former meal, or fasting too long.--The stomach should always have time to empty itself before it is filled again.</p>
<p>Some stomachs digest their contents sooner than others, and if long empty it may destroy the appetite, and greatly disturb both the head and animal spirits; for, from the great profusion of nerves spread upon the stomach, there is an immediate sympathy between that and the head. Hence the head is sure to be affected by whatever disorders the stomach, whether from any particular aliment that disagrees with it, or being overfilled, or too long empty. Such as feel a gnawing in the stomach, as it is called, should not wait till the stated time of the next meal, but take a small quantity of light, easily digested food, that the stomach may have something to work on.</p>
<p>Young persons in health, who use much exercise, may eat three times a day. But such as are in years, such as are weak, as do no work, use no exercise, or lead a sedentary life, eating twice in the day is sufficient; or, as in the present habits of society, it might be difficult to arrange the taking only two meals, let them take three very moderate ones. Old and weak persons may eat often, but then it should be very little at a time.</p>
<p>The quality of our food is a subject of greater difficulty than the quantity; moderation is an invariably safe guide in the latter instance; but though always favorable to prevent ill effects from any error in quality, it will not always be effectual.</p>
<p>To a person in good health, with a strong stomach, and whose constant beverage is water, cold or tepid, according to the season, 
 
<pb n="xiii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=19"/>

or some aqueous liquor, the niceties of choice in food or cookery are less material than to persons with naturally weak stomachs, or to those in sickness, or for children. But all persons who would to a certainty preserve their health and faculties, and live out the natural term of life, should use plain food, as all high seasonings and compound mixtures have an injurious effect, sooner or later, on the strongest constitutions. If a few instances can be quoted to the contrary, these, like other anomalies in nature, cannot constitute an exception to a well established fact.</p>
<p>No part of our aliment is more important than our beverage. It is essential to moisten and convey our more solid food into the stomach, and from thence to the respective parts of the body. To allay thirst, to dilute the blood, that it may circulate through the minutest vessels, to dissolve and carry off by the watery secretions the superfluous salts we take in our food; to answer these purposes no liquid is so effectual as pure water, with the exception of some few cases. No other liquid circulates so well, or mixes so immediately with our fluids. All other liquors are impregnated with particles which act strongly upon the solids or fluids, or both; but water being simple, operates only by diluting, moistening, and cooling, which are the great uses of drink pointed out to us by nature. Hence it is evident that water is in general the best and most wholesome drink; but some constitutions require something to warm and stimulate the stomach, and then fermented liquors taken in moderation are proper; such as beer, ale, cider, wine, &#38;c. the choice and quantity of which depend on the age, constitution, and manner of living of the drinker; and to have them pure is above all things essential; as otherwise, instead of being of any benefit, they will be highly detrimental.</p>
<p>Drams, or distilled spirituous liquors, the use of which is unhappily very prevalent, are of the most poisonous qualities; and from their direful effects are the destruction of thousands. From the degree of heat they have undergone in distillation they acquire a corrosive and burning quality, which makes them as certain to kill as laudanum or arsenic, though not so soon. They contract the fibres and vessels of the body, especially where they are the tenderest, as in the brain, and thus destroy the intellectual faculties. They injure the coat of the stomach, and thus expose the nerves and weaken the fibres till the whole stomach becomes at last soft, flabby, and relaxed. From whence ensues loss of appetite, indigestion, and diseases that generally terminate in premature death. Spirituous liquors in any way, whether alone, mixed with water, in punch, shrub, noyau, or other liqueurs, are all slow poisons.</p>
<p>It would be endless to enter on an account of the different qualities of all sorts of wines, but it may be said in general, that all the light wines of a moderate strength, due age and maturity, are more wholesome for the constitution than the rich, hot, strong, 
 
<pb n="xiv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=20"/>

heavy wines; for the light wines inflame the juices of the body less and go off the stomach with less difficulty.</p>
<p>The last thing to be said concerning liquors is, that wine and all other strong liquors, are as hard to digest as solid strong food. This is not only evident with respect to persons of weak stomachs and digestion, but also from strong healthy people, who only drink either water or small beer at their meals, and are able to eat and digest almost double the quantity of what they could if they drank strong liquors. It appears very plain, therefore, that we should not drink strong liquors at our meals, as by their heat and activity they hurry the food undigested into the habit of the body, and by that means lay a foundation for various distempers. An abstinence, in short, from fermented liquors would preserve our mental faculties in vigor, and our bodies from many painful disorders that afflict mankind, as there is no doubt that we may principally ascribe to them the gout, rheumatism, stone, cancer, fevers, hysterics, lunacy, apoplexy, and palsy.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">BOILING.</hd>
<p>This most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in perfection. It does not require quite so much nicety and attendance as roasting; to skim your pot well, and keep it really boiling (the slower the better) all the while, to know how long is required for doing the joint, &#38;c., and to take it up at the critical moment when it is done enough, comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This, however, demands a patient and perpetual vigilance, of which few persons are capable.</p>
<p>The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time; and make up a sufficient fire at first, to last all the time, without much mending or stirring. A frugal cook will manage with much less fire for boiling than she uses for roasting.</p>
<p>When the pot is coming to a boil there will always, from the cleanest meat and clearest water, rise a <emph rend="italic">scum</emph> to the top of it, proceeding partly from the water; this must be carefully taken off as soon as it rises.</p>
<p>On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When you have skimmed well, put in some cold water; which will throw up the rest of the scum.</p>
<p>The oftener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water is kept, the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat.</p>
<p>If let alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat, which, instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse and filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the butcher and poulterer be blamed for the carelessness of the cook in not skimming her pot.</p>
 
<pb n="xv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=21"/>

<p>Many put in <emph rend="italic">milk,</emph> to make what they boil look white; but this does more harm than good: others wrap it up in a cloth; but these are needless precautions: if the scum be attentively removed, meat will have a much more delicate color and finer flavor than it has when muffled up. This may give rather more trouble, but those who wish to excel in their art must only consider how the processes of it can be most perfectly performed: a cook, who has a proper pride and pleasure in her business, will make this her maxim on all occasions.</p>
<p>It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickness, or before thicker parts are done enough, the thinner will be done too much.</p>
<p>Put your meat into <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water, in the proportion of about a quart of water to a pound of meat: it should be covered with water during the whole of the process of boiling, but not drowned in it; the less water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savory will be the meat, and the better will be the broth.</p>
<p>The water should be heated gradually, according to the thickness, &#38;c. of the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of ten pounds weight should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually make the water hot, without causing it to boil for about forty minutes; if the water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up as if it was scorched: by keeping the water a certain time heating without boiling, the fibres of the meat are dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises.</p>
<p>The editor placed a thermometer in water in that state which cooks call gentle simmering; the heat was 212&#176;, i.e. the same degree as the strongest boiling.</p>
<p>Two mutton chops were covered with cold water; one boiled a gallop, while the other simmered very gently for three-quarters of an hour: the chop which was slowly simmered was decidedly superior to that which was boiled; it was much tenderer, more juicy, and much higher flavored. The liquor which boiled fast was in like proportion more savory, and when cold had much more fat on its surface. This explains why quick boiling renders meat hard, &#38;mp;c., because its juices are extracted in a greater degree.</p>
<p>Reckon the time from its first coming to a boil.</p>
<p>The old rule of 15 minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather too little: the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it will be.</p>
<p>For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked (which all will who have any regard for their stomachs), twenty minutes to a pound for fresh, and rather more for salted meat, will not be found too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing more or less time, according to the thickness of the joint, and the coldness of the weather: to know the state of which, let a thermometer be placed in the pantry; and when it falls below 40&#176;, tell 
 
<pb n="xvi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=22"/>

your cook to give rather more time in both roasting and boiling, always remembering, the slower it boils the better.</p>
<p>Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art; and cooks seem to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, and set it over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance whether it simmers without a bubble or boils a gallop.</p>
<p>Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time boiling than that which has been kept till it is what the butchers call <emph rend="italic">ripe</emph>; and longer in <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> than in <emph rend="italic">warm</emph> weather: if it be <emph rend="italic">frozen</emph>, it must be thawed before boiling as before roasting; if it be fresh-killed, it will be tough and hard, if you stew it ever so long, and ever so gently. In cold weather, the night before the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which the temperature is not less than 45 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
<p>The size of the <implement>boiling-pots</implement> should be adapted to what they are to contain: the larger the saucepan the more room it takes upon the fire, and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate increase of fire to boil it.</p>
<p>In small families we recommend <implement>block-tin saucepans,</implement> &#38;c. as lightest and safest. If proper care is taken of them, and they are well dried after they are cleaned, they are by far the cheapest; the purchase of a new tin saucepan being little more than the expense of tinning a copper one.</p>
<p>Let the covers of your <implement>boiling-pots</implement> fit close, not only to prevent unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape of the nutritive matter, which must then remain either in the meat or in the broth; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself under the edge of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste.</p>
<p>If you let meat or poultry remain in the water after it is done enough, it will become sodden, and lose its flavor.</p>
<p>Beef and mutton a little <emph rend="italic">under</emph>-done (especially very large joints, which will make the better hash or broil,) is not a great fault; by some people it is preferred: but lamb, pork, and veal are uneatable if not thoroughly boiled; but do not <emph rend="italic">over</emph>-do them.</p>
<p>A <implement>trivet</implement> or <implement>fish-drainer</implement> put on the bottom of the <implement>boiling-pot,</implement> raising the contents about an inch and a half from the bottom, will prevent that side of the meat which comes next the bottom from being done too much and the lower part of the meat will be as delicately done as the other part; and this will enable you to take out the contents of the pot, without sticking a fork, &#38;c. into it. If you have not a trivet, use four <implement>skewers,</implement> or a <implement>soup-plate</implement> laid the wrong side upwards.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">BAKING.</hd>
<p>Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of dressing a dinner in small families; and, I may say, that the oven is often the only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a joint of meat.</p>
 
<pb n="xvii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=23"/>

<p>I do not mean to deny the superior excellence of roasting to baking; but some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the same when roasted, that I have known them to be carried to the table, and eaten as such with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many other joints, will bake to great advantage, if the meat be good; I mean well-fed, rather inclined to be fat: if the meat be poor, no baker can give satisfaction.</p>
<p>When baking a poor joint of meat, before it has been half baked I have seen it start from the bone, and shrivel up scarcely to be believed.</p>
<p>Besides those joints above mentioned, I shall enumerate a few baked dishes which I can particularly recommend.</p>
<p>A pig, when sent to the <implement>baker</implement> prepared for baking, should have its ears and tail covered with buttered paper properly fastened on, and a bit of butter tied up in a piece of linen to baste the back with, otherwise it will be apt to blister: with a proper share of attention from the <implement>baker,</implement> I consider this way equal to a roasted one.</p>
<p>A goose prepared the same as for roasting, taking care to have it on a stand, and when half done to turn the other side upwards. A duck the same.</p>
<p>A buttock of beef the following way is particularly fine. After it has been in salt about a week, to be well washed, and put into a brown earthen pan with a pint of water; cover the pan tight with two or three thicknesses of cap or <implement>foolscap paper</implement>: never cover anything that is to be baked with brown paper, the pitch and tar that is in brown paper will give the meat a smoky, bad taste: give it four or five hours in a moderately heated oven.</p>
<p>A ham (if not too old) put in soak for an hour, taken out and wiped, a crust made sufficient to cover it all over, and baked in a moderately heated oven, cuts fuller of gravy, and of a finer flavor, than a boiled one. I have been in the habit of baking small cod-fish, haddock, and mackerel, with a dust of flour, and some bits of butter put on them; eels, when large and stuffed; herrings and sprats, in a brown pan, with vinegar and a little spice, and tied over with paper. A hare, prepared the same as for roasting, with a few pieces of butter, and a little drop of milk put into the dish, and basted several times, will be found nearly equal to roasting; or cut it up, season it properly, put it into a jar or pan, and cover it over and bake it in a moderate oven for about three hours. In the same manner, I have been in the habit of baking legs and shins of beef, ox cheeks, &#38;c. prepared with a seasoning of onions, turnips, &#38;c.: they will take about four hours: let them stand till cold, to skim off the fat; then warm it up all together, or part, as you may want it.</p>
<p>All these I have been in the habit of baking for the first families.</p>
<p>The time each of the above articles should take depends much upon the state of the oven, and I do consider the <implement>baker</implement> a sufficient

judge; if they are sent to him in time, he must be very neglectful if they are not ready at the time they are ordered.</p>
</div>
<div type="other">
<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">ROASTING.</hd>
<p>Let the young cook never forget that cleanliness is the chief cardinal virtue of the kitchen; the first preparation for roasting is to take care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand and water; nothing else. When it has been well scoured with this, dry it with a clean cloth. If spits are wiped clean as soon as the meat is drawn from them, and while they are hot, a very little cleaning will be required. The less the spit is passed through the meat the better; and, before you spit it, joint it properly, especially necks and loins, that the carver may separate them easily and neatly, and take especial care it be evenly balanced on the spit, that its motion may be regular, and the fire operate equally on each part of it; therefore, be provided with <implement>balancing-skewers</implement> and <implement>cookholds,</implement> and see it is properly jointed.</p>
<p>Make up the fire in time; let it be proportioned to the dinner to be dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end than the thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be done nice and brown.</p>
<p>A cook must be as particular to proportion her fire to the business she has to do, as a chemist: the degree of heat most desirable for dressing the different sorts of food ought to be attended to with the utmost precision.</p>
<p>The fire that is but just sufficient to receive the noble sirloin will parch up a lighter joint.</p>
<p>Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly avoid it; but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a considerable distance, and allow a little more time.</p>
<p>Preserve the fat, by covering it with paper, for this purpose called "<implement>kitchen-paper,</implement>" and tie it on with fine twine; pins and <implement>skewers</implement> can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to let out the gravy: besides, the paper often starts from them and catches fire, to the great injury of the meat.</p>
<p>If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should be little and brisk: when you have a large joint to roast, make up a sound, strong fire, equally good in every part, or your meat cannot be equally roasted, nor have that uniform color which constitutes the beauty of good roasting.</p>
<p>Give the fire a good stirring before you lay the joint down; examine it from time to time while the spit is going round; keep it clear at the bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in the front, which will spoil the look and taste of the meat, and hinder it from roasting evenly.</p>
<p>When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end than the other, place the spit slanting, with the thickest part nearest the fire.</p>
 
<pb n="xix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=25"/>

<p>Do not put meat too near the fire at first; the larger the joint; the farther it must be kept from the fire: if once it gets scorched, the outside will become hard, and acquire a disagreeable, empyreumatic taste; and the fire being prevented from penetrating into it, the meat will appear done before it is little more than half done, besides losing the pale brown color, which it is the beauty of roasted meat to have.</p>
<p>Be very careful to place the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> at such a distance from the fire as just to catch the drippings: if it is too near, the ashes will fall into it, and spoil the drippings.</p>
<p>If it is too far from the fire to catch them, you will not only lose your drippings, but the meat will be blackened and spoiled by the f&#x153;tid smoke, which will arise when the fat falls on the live cinders.</p>
<p>A large <implement>dripping-pan</implement> is convenient for several purposes. It should not be less than twenty-eight inches long and twenty inches wide, and have a covered well on the side from the fire, to collect the drippings; this will preserve them in the most delicate state: in a pan of the above size you may set fried fish, and various dishes, to keep hot.</p>
<p>The time meat will take roasting will vary according to the time it has been kept, and the temperature of the weather; the same weight will be twenty minutes or half an hour longer in cold weather, than it will be in warm; and if fresh killed, than if it has been kept till it is tender.</p>
<p>Everybody knows the advantage of <emph rend="italic">slow boiling. Slow roasting</emph> is equally important.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give any specific rule for time; but if your fire is made as before directed, your meat-screen sufficiently large to guard what you are dressing from currents of air, and the meat is not frosted, you cannot do better than follow the old general rule of allowing rather more than a quarter of an hour to the pound; a little more or less, according to the temperature of the weather, in proportion as the piece is thick or thin, the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and the frequency with which you baste it; the more it is basted the less time it will take, as it keeps the meat soft and mellow on the outside, and the fire acts with more force upon it.</p>
<p>Reckon the time, not to the hour when dinner is ordered, but to the moment the roasts will be wanted. Supposing there are a dozen people to sip soup and eat fish first, you may allow them ten or fifteen minutes for the former, and about as long for the latter, more or less, according to the temptations the "BON GOUT" of these preceding courses has to attract their attention.</p>
<p>When the joint is half done, remove the spit and <implement>dripping-pan</implement> back, and stir up your fire thoroughly, that it may burn clear and bright for the browning; when the steam from the meat draws towards the fire, it is a sign of its being done enough; but you will be the best judge of that, from the time it has been down, the 
 
<pb n="xx" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=26"/>

strength of the fire you have used, and the distance your spit has been from it.</p>
<p>Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy, and just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire to brown it. If you wish to froth it, baste it, and dredge it with flour carefully: you cannot do this delicately nice without a very good light. The common fault seems to be using too much flour. The meat should have a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of being covered with a paste. Those who are particular about the froth use butter instead of drippings.</p>
<p>A good cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance and color of her roasts, as a young beauty is to her complexion at a birthday ball. If your meat does not brown so much, or so evenly as you wish, take two ounces of glaze, i.e. portable soup, put four table-spoonfuls of water, and let it warm and dissolve gradually by the side of the fire. This will be done in about a quarter of an hour; put it on the meat equally all over with a <implement>paste-brush</implement> the last thing before it goes to table.</p>
<p>Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally considered one of the most easy and simple processes of cookery, it requires more unremitting attention to perform it perfectly well than it does to make most made dishes.</p>
<p>That made dishes are the most difficult preparations, deserves to be reckoned among the culinary vulgar errors; in plain roasting and boiling it is not easy to repair a mistake once made; and all the discretion and attention of a steady careful cook must be unremittingly upon the alert.</p>
</div>
<div type="other">
<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">FRYING.</hd>
<p>Frying is often a convenient mode of cookery; it may be performed by a fire which will not do for roasting or boiling; and by the introduction of the pan between the meat and the fire, things get more equally dressed.</p>
<p>The <implement>Dutch oven</implement> or <implement>bonnet</implement> is a very convenient utensil for small things, and a very useful substitute for the <implement>jack,</implement> the <implement>gridiron,</implement> or <implement>frying-pan.</implement></p>
<p>A frying-pan should be about four inches deep, with a perfectly flat and thick bottom, twelve inches long and nine broad, with perpendicular sides, and must be half filled with fat: good frying is, in fact, boiling in fat. To make sure that the pan is quite clean, rub a little fat over it, and then make it warm, and wipe it out with a clean cloth.</p>
<p>Be very particular in frying, never to use any oil, butter, lard, or drippings, but what is quite clean, fresh, and free from salt. Any thing dirty spoils the look; any thing bad-tasted or stale spoils the flavor; and salt prevents its browning.</p>
<p>Fine olive oil is the most delicate for frying; but the best oil is expensive, and bad oil spoils every thing that is dressed with it.</p>
 
<pb n="xxi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=27"/>

<p>For general purposes, and especially for fish, clean fresh lard is not near so expensive as oil or clarified butter, and does almost as well. Butter often burns before you are aware of it; and what you fry will get a dark and dirty appearance.</p>
<p>Dripping, if nicely clean and fresh, is almost as good as any thing; if not clean, it may be easily clarified. Whatever fat you use, after you have done frying, let it remain in the pan for a few minutes, and then pour it through a sieve into a clean basin; it will do three or four times as well as it did at first, <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> if it has not burned: but, the fat you have fried fish in must not be used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>To know when the fat is of a proper heat, according to what you are to fry, is the great secret in frying.</p>
<p>To fry fish, parsley, potatoes, or any thing that is watery, your fire must be very clear, and the fat quite hot; which you may be pretty sure of, when it has done hissing, and is still. We cannot insist too strongly on this point: if the fat is not very hot, you cannot fry fish either to a good color, or firm and crisp.</p>
<p>To be quite certain, throw a little bit of bread into the pan; if it fries crisp, the fat is ready; if it burns the bread, it is too hot.</p>
<p>The fire under the pan must be clear and sharp, otherwise the fat is so long before it becomes ready, and demands such attendance to prevent the accident of its catching fire, that the patience of cooks is exhausted, and they frequently, from ignorance or impatience, throw in what they are going to fry before the fat is half hot enough. Whatever is so fried will be pale and sodden, and offend the palate and stomach not less than the eye.</p>
<p>Have a good light to fry by, that you may see when you have got the right color: a lamp fixed on a stem, with a loaded foot, which has an arm that lengthens out, and slides up and down like a reading candlestick, is a most useful appendage to kitchen fireplaces, which are very seldom light enough for the nicer operations of cookery.</p>
<p>After all, if you do not thoroughly drain the fat from what you have fried, especially from those things that are full dressed in bread crumbs, or biscuit powder, &#38;c., your cooking will do you no credit.</p>
<p>The dryness of fish depends much upon its having been fried in fat of a due degree of heat; it is then crisp and dry in a few minutes after it is taken out of the pan: when it is not, lay it on a soft cloth before the fire, turning it occasionally, till it is. This will sometimes take fifteen minutes: therefore, always fry fish as long as this before you want them, for fear you may find this necessary.</p>
<p>To fry fish, see receipt to fry soles, which is the only circumstantial account of the process that has yet been printed. If the cook will study it with a little attention, she must soon become an accomplished frier.</p>
<p>Frying, though one of the most common of culinary operations, is one that is least commonly performed perfectly well.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">BROILING.</hd>
<p>Cleanliness is extremely essential in this mode of cookery.</p>
<p>Keep your <implement>gridiron</implement> quite clean between the bars, and bright on the top: when it is hot, wipe it well with a linen cloth: just before you use it, rub the bars with clean mutton-suet, to prevent the meat from being marked by the <implement>gridiron.</implement></p>
<p>Take care to prepare your fire in time, so that it may burn quite clear: a brisk and clear fire is indispensable, or you cannot give your meat that browning which constitutes the perfection of this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to food it cannot receive any other way.</p>
<p>The chops or slices should be from half to three-quarters of an inch in thickness; if thicker, they will be done too much on the outside before the inside is done enough.</p>
<p>Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing is done: never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you make smoke and spoil it.</p>
<p>Let the bars of the <implement>gridiron</implement> be all hot through, but yet not burning hot upon the surface: this is the perfect and fine condition of the <implement>gridiron.</implement></p>
<p>As the bars keep away as much heat as their breadth covers, it is absolutely necessary they should be thoroughly hot before the thing to be cooked be laid on them.</p>
<p>The bars of <implement>gridirons</implement> should be made concave, and terminate in a trough to catch the gravy and keep the fat from dropping into the fire and making a smoke; which will spoil the broil.</p>
<p><implement>Upright gridirons</implement> are the best, as they can be used at any fire without fear of smoke; and the gravy is preserved in the trough under them.</p>
<p>N. B. Broils must be brought to table as hot as possible; set a dish to heat when you put your chops on the <implement>gridiron,</implement> from whence to the mouth their progress must be as quick as possible.</p>
<p>When the fire is not clear, the business of the <implement>gridiron</implement> may be done by the <implement>Dutch oven</implement> or <implement>bonnet.</implement></p>
<p>Take care to have a very clear, brisk fire; throw a little salt on it; make the <implement>gridiron</implement> hot, and set it slanting, to prevent the fat from dropping into the fire, and making a smoke. It requires more practice and care than is generally supposed to do steaks to a nicety; and for want of these little attentions, this very common dish, which every body is supposed capable of dressing, seldom comes to table in perfection.</p>
<p>Ask those you cook for, if they like it under, or thoroughly done; and what accompaniments they like best; it is usual to put a table-spoonful of ketchup, or a little minced eschalot, into a dish before the fire; while you are broiling, turn the steak, &#38;c. with a pair of <implement>steak-tongs,</implement> it will be done in about ten or fifteen minutes; rub a bit of butter over it, and send it up garnished with pickles and finely-scraped horse-radish.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">BROTHS AND SOUPS.</hd>
<p>The cook must pay continual attention to the condition of her <implement>stew-pans,</implement> <implement>soup-kettles,</implement> &#38;c. which should be examined every time they are used. The prudent housewife will carefully examine the condition of them herself at least once a month. Their covers also must be kept perfectly clean and well tinned, and the <implement>stew-pans</implement> not only on the inside, but about a couple of inches on the outside: many mischiefs arise from their getting out of repair; and if not kept nicely tinned, all your good work will be in vain; the broths and soups will look green and dirty, taste bitter and poisonous, and will be spoiled both for the eye and palate, and your credit will be lost.</p>
<p>The health, and even life of the family, depends upon this, and the cook may be sure her employers had rather pay the tinman's bill than the doctor's; therefore, attention to this cannot fail to engage the regard of the mistress, between whom and the cook it will be my utmost endeavor to promote perfect harmony.</p>
<p>If she has the misfortune to scorch or blister the tinning of her pan, which will happen sometimes to the most careful cook, I advise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint her employers, who will thank her for candidly mentioning an accident; and censure her deservedly if she conceal it.</p>
<p>Take care to be properly provided with sieves and <implement>tammy cloths,</implement> spoons and ladles. Make it a rule without an exception, never to use them till they are well cleaned and thoroughly dried, nor any <implement>stew-pans,</implement> &#38;c. without first washing them out with boiling water, and rubbing them well with a dry cloth and a little bran, to clean them from grease, sand, &#38;c., or any bad smell they may have got since they were last used: never neglect this.</p>
<p>Though we do not suppose our cook to be such a naughty slut as to wilfully neglect her <implement>broth-pots,</implement> &#38;c., yet we may recommend her to wash them immediately, and take care they are thoroughly dried at the fire, before they are put by, and to keep them in a dry place, for damp will rust and destroy them very soon: attend to this the first moment you can spare after the dinner is sent up.</p>
<p>Never put by any soup, gravy, &#38;c. in metal utensils; in which never keep any thing longer than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of cookery; the acid, vegetables, fat, &#38;c. employed in making soups, &#38;c. are capable of dissolving such utensils: therefore stone or earthen vessels should be used for this purpose.</p>
<p><implement>Stew-pans,</implement> <implement>soup-pots,</implement> and <implement>preserving pans,</implement> with thick and round bottoms (such as saucepans are made with), will wear twice as long, and are cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sides are soldered to the bottom, for sand and grease get into the joined part, and cookeys say that it is next to an impossibility to dislodge it, even if their nails are as long as Nebuchadnezzar's.</p>
<p>Take care that the lids fit as close as possible, that the broth, 
 
<pb n="xxiv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=30"/>

soup, and sauces, &#38;c. may not waste by evaporation. They are good for nothing, unless they fit tight enough to keep the steam in and the smoke out.</p>
<p><implement>Stew-pans</implement> and saucepans should be always bright on the upper rim, where the fire does not burn them; but to scour them all over is not only giving the cook needless trouble, but wearing out the vessels.</p>
<p>Lean, juicy beef, mutton, or veal, form the basis of broth; procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and as fresh killed as possible.</p>
<p>Stale meat will make broth grouty and bad tasted, and fat meat is wasted. This only applies to those broths which are required to be perfectly clear: fat and clarified drippings may be so combined with vegetable mucilage, as to afford, at the small cost of one penny per quart, a nourishing and palatable soup, fully adequate to satisfy appetite and support strength: this will open a new source to those benevolent housekeepers, who are disposed to relieve the poor, will show the industrious classes how much they have it in their power to assist themselves, and rescue them from being objects of charity dependent on the precarious bounty of others, by teaching them how they may obtain a cheap, abundant, salubrious, and agreeable aliment for themselves and families.</p>
<p>This soup has the advantage of being very easily and very soon made, with no more fuel than is necessary to warm a room. Those who have not tasted it, cannot imagine what a salubrious, savory and satisfying meal is produced by the judicious combination of cheap homely ingredients.</p>
<p>The general fault of our soups seems to be the employment of an excess of spice, and too small a portion of roots and herbs.</p>
<p>There is no French dinner without soup, which is regarded as an indispensable <emph rend="italic">overture;</emph> and believe it an excellent plan to begin the banquet with a basin of good soup, which, by moderating the appetite for solid animal food, is certainly a salutiferous custom.</p>
<p>We again caution the cook to avoid over-seasoning, especially with predominant flavors, which, however agreeable they may be to some, are extremely disagreeable to others.</p>
<p>Zest, soy, cavice, coratch, anchovy, curry powder, savory ragout powder, soup herb powder, browning, ketchups, pickle liquor, beer, wine, and sweet herbs, and savory spice, are very convenient auxiliaries to finish soups, &#38;c.</p>
<p>The proportion of wine should not exceed a large wine-glassful to a quart of soup. This is as much as can be admitted without the vinous flavor becoming remarkably predominant though not only much larger quantities of wine (of which claret is incomparably the best, because it contains less spirit and more flavor; and English palates are less acquainted with it), but even <emph rend="italic">veritable eau de vie</emph> is ordered in many books, and used by many (especially tavern cooks). So much are their soups overloaded 
 
<pb n="xxv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=31"/>

with relish, that if you will eat enough of them they will certainly make you drunk, if they don't make you sick: all this frequently arises from an old cook measuring the excitability of the eaters' palates by his own, which may be so blunted by incessant tasting, that to awaken it, requires wine instead of water, and cayenne and garlic for black pepper and onion.</p>
<p>The art of composing a rich soup is so to proportion the several ingredients one to another, that no particular taste be stronger than the rest, but to produce such a fine harmonious relish that the whole is delightful. This requires that judicious combination of the materials which constitutes the <emph rend="italic">"chef d'&#x153;uvre"</emph> of culinary science.</p>

<p>In the first place, take care that the roots and herbs be perfectly well cleaned; proportion the water to the quantity of meat and other ingredients, generally a pound of meat to a quart of water for soups, and double that quantity for gravies. If they stew gently, little more water need be put in at first than is expected at the end; for when the pot is covered quite close, and the fire gentle, very little is wasted.</p>
<p>Gentle stewing is incomparably the best; the meat is more tender, and the soup better flavored.</p>
<p>It is of the first importance that the cover of a <implement>soup-kettle</implement> should fit very close, or the broth will evaporate before you are aware of it.</p>
<p>Place your <implement>soup-pot</implement> over a moderate fire, which will make the water hot without causing it to boil for at least half an hour; if the water boils immediately, it will not penetrate the meat, and cleanse it from the clotted blood, and other matters which ought to go off in scum; the meat will be hardened all over by violent heat; will shrink up as if it was scorched, and give hardly any gravy: on the contrary, by keeping the water a certain time heating without boiling, the meat swells, becomes tender, its fibres are dilated, and it yields a quantity of <emph rend="italic">scum</emph>, which must be taken off as soon as it appears.</p>
<p>It is not till after a good half hour's hot infusion that we may mend the fire, and make the pot boil: still continue to remove <emph rend="italic">the scum</emph>; and when no more appears, put in the vegetables, &#38;c. and a little salt. These will cause more <emph rend="italic">scum</emph> to rise, which must be taken off immediately; then cover the pot very closely, and place it at a proper distance from the fire, where it will boil very gently, and equally, and by no means fast.</p>
<p>By quick and strong boiling the volatile and finest parts of the ingredients are evaporated, and fly off with the steam, and the coarser parts are rendered soluble; so you lose the good, and get the bad.</p>
<p>Soups will generally take from <emph rend="italic">three</emph> to <emph rend="italic">six</emph> hours.</p>
<p>Prepare your broths and soups the evening before you want them. This will give you more time to attend to the rest of your dinner the next day; and when the soup is cold, the <emph rend="italic">fat</emph> may be 
 
<pb n="xxvi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=32"/>

much more easily and completely removed from the surface of it. When you decant it, take care not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve, or even through a <implement>TAMIS,</implement> which is the best strainer, the soups appear smoother and finer, and it is much easier cleaned than any sieve. If you strain it while it is hot, pass it through a clean <implement>tamis</implement> or napkin, previously soaked in cold water; the coldness of this will coagulate the fat, and only suffer the pure broth to pass through.</p>
<p>The full flavor of the ingredients can only be extracted by very long and slow simmering; during which take care to prevent evaporation, by covering the pot as close as possible: the best stew-pot is a <implement>digester.</implement></p>
<p>Clear soups must be perfectly transparent; thickened soups, about the consistence of rich cream; and remember that thickened soups require nearly double the quantity of seasoning.</p>
<p>To thicken and give body to soups and sauces, the following materials are used: they must be gradually mixed with the soup till thoroughly incorporated with it; and it should have at least half an hour's gentle simmering after: if it is at all lumpy, pass it through a <implement>tamis</implement> or a fine sieve. Bread raspings, bread, isinglass, potato mucilage, flour, or fat skimmings and flour, or flour and butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal and water rubbed well together.</p>
<p>To their very rich gravies, &#38;c. the French add the white meat of partridges, pigeons, or fowls, pounded to a pulp, and rubbed through a sieve. A piece of beef, which has been boiled to make broth, pounded in the like manner with a bit of butter and flour, and gradually incorporated with the gravy or soup, will be found a satisfactory substitute for these more expensive articles.</p>
<p>Meat from which broth has been made and all its juice has been extracted, is then excellently well prepared for POTTING, and is quite as good, or better, than that which has been baked till it is dry; indeed, if it be pounded, and seasoned in the usual manner, it will be an elegant and savory luncheon, or supper, and costs nothing but the trouble of preparing it, which is very little, and a relish is procured for sandwiches, &#38;c. of what heretofore has been by the poorest housekeeper considered <emph rend="italic">the perquisite of the</emph> CAT.</p>
<p>Keep some spare broth lest your soup-liquor waste in boiling, and get too thick, and for gravy for your made dishes, various sauces, &#38;c.; for many of which it is a much better basis than melted butter.</p>
<p>The soup of mock turtle, and the other thickened soups, will supply you with a thick gravy sauce for <emph rend="italic">poultry, fish, ragouts,</emph> &#38;c.; and by a little management of this sort, you may generally contrive to have plenty of good gravies and good sauces with very little trouble or expense.</p>
<p>If soup is too thin or too weak, take off the cover of your <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and let it boil till some of the watery part of it has evaporated, or else add some of the thickening materials we have before mentioned; 
 
<pb n="xxvii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=33"/>

and have at hand some plain browning. This simple preparation is much better than any of the compounds bearing that name; as it colors sauce or soup without much interfering with its flavor, and is a much better way of coloring them than burning the surface of the meat.</p>
<p>When soups and gravies are kept from day to day, <emph rend="italic">in hot weather</emph>, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded <implement>tureens</implement> or pans, and placed in a cool cellar; in temperate weather every other day may be enough.</p>
<p>We hope we have now put the common cook into possession of the whole <emph rend="italic">arcana</emph> of soup-making, without much trouble to herself, or expense to her employers. It would greatly diminish the expense, and improve soups, if the agents employed to give them a zest were not put in above fifteen minutes before the finish, and half the quantity of spice, &#38;c. would do. A strong heat soon dissipates the spirit of the wine, and evaporates the aroma and flavor of the spices and herbs, which are volatile in the heat of boiling water.</p>
<p>Warm fluids, in the form of soup, unite with our juices much sooner and better than those that are cold and raw: on this account, RESTORATIVE SOUP is the best food for those who are enfeebled by disease or dissipation, and for old people, whose teeth and digestive organs are impaired.</p>
<p>After catching cold, in nervous headaches, cholics, indigestions, and different kinds of cramp and spasms in the stomach, warm broth is of excellent service.</p>
<p>After intemperate feasting, to give the stomach a holyday for a day or two by a diet on mutton broth, or vegetable soup, &#38;c. is the best way to restore its tone. "The stretching any power to its utmost extent weakens it. If the stomach be every day obliged to do as much as it can, it will every day be able to do less. A wise traveller will never force his horse to perform as much as he can in one day upon a long journey."</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN ARTICLES.</hd>
<p>We shall conclude these Introductory Observations, with a few remarks on the qualities of certain Articles in common use.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Butter.</hd>
<p>Well made pure butter is lenient and nourishing, eaten cold, in moderation, with bread. But upon hot new bread, or hot toast, or used as sauce to animal food, it is not wholesome. In the two first instances it is very apt to turn acid in the stomach; and in the latter, to float uppermost in the stomach, and disturb the digestion. If melted thick and carefully, and eaten with vegetable food and bread only, it is not so liable to this objection.</p>
<p>Butter is good for dry, constipated habits, but not for such as are bilious, asthmatic, or corpulent.</p>
 
<pb n="xxviii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=34"/>

<hd rend="italic" align="center">Honey.</hd>
<p>Honey is nourishing and wholesome, particularly for persons with coughs, weak lungs, and short breath. It is balsamic, cleansing, and makes the body soluble.</p>
<p>Great care should be taken to get it fresh and pure; it is apt to turn sour by long keeping.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Sugar.</hd>
<p>Sugar used in moderation is nourishing and good, but much of it destroys the appetite, and injures the digestion. Moist sugar is the sweetest, and most opening; refined sugar, of a binding nature. The preparations made of sugar, such as barley-sugar, sugar-candy, &#38;c. are all indigestible and bad, as the good properties of the sugar are destroyed by the process it undergoes in the making them. They are particularly injurious to children, from cloying their delicate stomachs. Young children are in general better without sugar, as it is very apt to turn acid and disagree with weak stomachs; and the kind of food they take has natural sweetness enough in it not at all to require it.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Salt.</hd>
<p>Salt, moderately used, especially with flesh, fish, butter, and cheese, is very beneficial, as it naturally stimulates weak or disordered stomachs, and checks fermentations. But if it be immoderately used it has a contrary effect. Very little salt should be used with vegetable food of the grain or seed kind; for the less salt that is put to it the milder, cooler, pleasanter, and easier of digestion it will be. Salt excites the appetite, assists the stomach in digesting crude phlegmatic substances, is cleansing, and prevents putrefaction; but if too much used, it heats and dries the blood and natural moisture. It is best for phlegmatic, cold, and moist stomachs; and most injurious to hot, lean bodies.</p>
<p>Salt-petre is particularly bad for bilious persons.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Vinegar.</hd>
<p>Vinegar is cooling, opening, excites the appetite, assists digestion, is good for hot stomachs, resists putrefaction, and therefore very good against pestilential diseases. Too much use of it injures the nerves, emaciates some constitutions, is hurtful to the breast, and makes people look old and withered, with pale lips.</p>
<p>The best vinegar is that which is made of the best wines. Lemon-juice and verjuice have much the same qualities and effects as vinegar.</p>
<p>The commonest vinegar is least adulterated.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Mustard.</hd>
<p>Mustard quickens the appetite, warms the stomach, assists in digesting hard meats, and dries up surperfluous moisture. It seldom agrees with weak stomachs.</p>
 
<pb n="xxix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=35"/>

<hd rend="italic" align="center">Spices.</hd>
<p>Cayenne pepper, black pepper, and ginger, may be esteemed the best of spices.</p>
<p>Nutmegs, cloves, mace, cinnamon, and allspice, are generally productive of indigestion and headache to weak persons.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Garlic, &#38;c.</hd>
<p>Garlic, onions, rocambole, shallots, leeks, and horse-radish, are occasionally good for strong stomachs, but generally disagree with weak stomachs.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Tea.</hd>
<p>The frequent drinking of a quantity of strong tea, as is the general practice, relaxes and weakens the tone of the stomach, whence proceeds nausea and indigestion, with a weakness of the nerves, and flabbiness of the flesh, and very often a pale wan complexion. Milk, when mixed with it in some quantity, lessens its bad qualities, by rendering it softer, and nutritious; and, with a moderate quantity of sugar, it may then be a proper breakfast, as a diluent, to those who are strong, and live freely, in order to cleanse the alimentary passages, and wash off the salts from the kidneys and bladder. But persons of weak nerves ought to abstain from it as carefully as from drams and cordial drops; as it causes the same kind of irritation on the tender delicate fibres of the stomach, which ends in lowness, trembling and vapors.</p>
<p>It should never be drank hot by any body. Green tea is less wholesome than black or bohea.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Coffee.</hd>
<p>Coffee affords very little nourishment, and is apt to occasion heat, dryness, stimulation and tremors of the nerves, and for these reasons is thought to occasion palsies, watchfulness, and leanness. Hence it is very plain that it must be pernicious to hot, dry, and bilious constitutions. If moderately used it may be beneficial to phlegmatic persons, but, if drank very strong, or in great quantities, it will prove injurious even to them.</p>
<p>The following remarks on Coffee, were published in London, by a physician. 1st. The raw coffee should be round and small grained, free from dirt and of a light color. It should have no appearance of mouldiness, and be kept quite free from any strong smell. It should not be long kept in sacks with other provisions, as there is no substance more apt to obtain strong and disagreeable odors from the presence of its neighbors. Rum injures it; and Miller even goes so far as to state that a few bags of pepper on board a ship from India upon one occasion spoiled the whole cargo.</p>
 
<pb n="xxx" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=36"/>

<p>2nd. When the grains are large, flat, and of a green color, they should be kept on hand, in a dry situation, a long time before use. Every West India planter knows this fact, although his interest often induces him to send the article to market before it is old and dry enough.</p>
<p>3d. Roasting coffee is by far the most difficult operation of the housekeeper; when carried far enough, an aromatic oil is formed by the heat and forces itself out upon the surface of the grains, giving them a glossy appearance, and an odor which is considered their perfection; yet too little roasting prevents the aroma from appearing, and too much completely volatilizes it, leaving nothing but a flat bitter taste. The heat should be strong and the operation shortened as much as possible without burning the grains. The <implement>roaster</implement> should be close or well covered all the time, and in order to improve the looks and flavor, a small piece of butter may be added to the coffee, while parching.</p>
<p>4th. When thus prepared, coffee may be preserved for use in large quantities, without losing much of its freshness, provided the vessels containing it be well covered.</p>
<p>5th. An infusion of coffee is better than a decoction, simply because the heat, in the last case, being stronger and more lasting, drives off more of the aromatic oil. It is better, therefore, to grind the coffee very fine, and then to expose it, by means of a bag or strainer, to the action of boiling water, than to boil it any length of time. Heat, though unavoidable, injures the flavor, and the best coffee I remember to have tasted was made by exposing the powder to a pressure of <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water, a tea-spoonful of this extract, thrown into a cup of hot water, was sufficient. It is not a bad method to allow the ground coffee to lie in cold water between meals, and then prepare it by adding hot water. Just in proportion to the continuance of heat, in this and in the last operation, the fragrance disappears, and is replaced by a strong bitter taste, which, according to the experiments of Chenevix, depends upon the presence of tannin (resembling that in tan bark). Roasting, besides forming this bitter substance, deprives the coffee of its nutritious qualities.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Chocolate.</hd>
<p>Is rich, nutritious, and soothing, saponaceous, and cleansing; from which quality it often helps digestion, and excites the appetite. It is only proper for some of the leaner and stronger sort of phlegmatic constitutions, and some old people who are healthy, and accustomed to bodily exercise.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Cocoa.</hd>
<p>Is of the same nature as chocolate, but not so rich; and therefore lighter upon the stomach.</p>
 
<pb n="xxxi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=37"/>

<hd rend="italic" align="center">Fruit.</hd>
<p>Fruits are of different degrees of digestibility. Those of a hard texture, as some kinds of apples, melons, apricots, several sorts of fleshy plums, and all immature fruits, are difficult of digestion.</p>
<p>Strawberries, raspberries, currants, gooseberries, cherries, green-gages, peaches, nectarines, melting pears, mulberries, figs, grapes, medlars, when all quite ripe, are more easily dissolved in the stomach.</p>
<p>Fruit, moderately eaten, is wholesome, particularly as correcting the grossness of animal food. But an excess of it, and especially of unripe fruit, is productive of many diseases; amongst children in particular, it often occasions such as the nettle rash and St. Anthony's fire.</p>
<p>Fruit invariably disagrees with bilious persons; but is a sovereign remedy for the sea scurvy, and for diseases arising from an excess of animal food.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Nuts and Almonds.</hd>
<p>Most kinds of nuts, and almonds, from their milky or oily nature, contain a good deal of nourishment; but they require to be well chewed, as they are difficult of digestion. Persons with weak stomachs should not eat them. The worst time at which they can be eaten is after a meal.</p>
<hd rend="italic" align="center">Olives.</hd>
<p>Olives that have been gathered immature or unripe, and put into a pickle to keep them sound, are apt, especially if frequently eaten, to obstruct the stomach and passages. The best way of eating them is with good bread, when the stomach is properly empty. To eat them upon a full stomach is very bad.</p>

<hd align="center">DIRECTIONS FOR CURING AND COOKING PICKLED FISH.<ref target="n001">*</ref></hd>
<p>The use of <emph rend="italic">Pickled Fish</emph>, such as Mackerel, Salmon, Shad, &#38;c. is becoming more general than formerly, and would be still more extensive if the proper mode of preparing them for the table was better understood. These fish constitute not only a salutary diet, but in many cases makes a very beneficial change in our food.</p>
<p>Whoever will give the following directions a fair trial will become sensible of their value:--</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">First.</emph> The fish should be kept covered by the pickle by means of a flat stone or slate, laid on them. The oil, or animal fat, which floats on the top of the <implement>cask,</implement> should not be removed, as it prevents the fish from rusting; but in taking the fish from the barrel or keg, this oil ought to be put aside, care being taken not to let the fish touch it. <emph rend="italic">Secondly</emph>--The fish should be washed clean, then put to soak in a large quantity of water for eight or ten hours, with the flesh side down. The time of soaking may be varied to suit the palate. It must again be washed clean, put it to soak six or eight hours in milk, (if you have it) then dry it by the fire. <emph rend="italic">Thirdly</emph>--When dry lay it on the <implement>gridiron,</implement> with the flesh side downward, over pretty lively coals, for five minutes, or till it is moderately browned, then turn it with a plate, or some flat instrument that will not break the skin, and let it remain over the coals ten or fifteen minutes, or till it is cooked sufficiently. Slide it off the <implement>gridiron</implement> into the dish, and strip off the backbone with a broad knife: pat the fish, to cause the thick part of the fish to absorb the fat from the belly part; use no butter--then you will enjoy all the flavor and juices of the fish.</p>
<p>If a Mackerel or Shad so prepared does not relish, it must be more the fault of the palate, than of the food. How many articles, capable of being made into excellent dishes, are lost or spoiled from want of care and skill in dressing them.</p>
<p size="smaller" id="n001">* As the whole beauty of pickled Fish depends upon the right method of cooking it, we insert by itself the receipt of Capt. Henry Purkitt, Massachusetts Inspector of Fish, who obligingly handed it to the Editor.</p>

The boiling of bacon is a very simple subject to comment upon; but our main object is to teach common cooks the art of dressing common food in the best manner. Bacon is sometimes as salt as salt can make it, therefore before it is boiled it must be soaked in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> for an hour or two, changing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> once; then pare off the rusty and smoked part, trim it nicely on the under side, and scrape the rind as clean as possible. <emph rend="italic">Mem</emph>.--Bacon is an extravagant article in housekeeping; there is often twice as much dressed as need be: when it is sent to table as an accompaniment to boiled poultry

The names of the various pieces, according to the method of dividing the carcass, are as follows:--The hind quarter contains the Sirloin; Rump; Edge-bone; Buttock, or Round; Mouse Buttock; Veiny Piece; Thick Flank; Thin Flank; Leg Ran; Legs; Fore Rib; Five Ribs.--The fore quarter contains the Middle Rib of four ribs; Chuck of three ribs; Shoulder, or Leg-of-Mutton Piece, containing a part of the Blade-bone; Brisket; Clod; Neck End, or Sticking Piece; Shin; Cheek. Besides these are the Tongue and Palate. The Entrails consist of the Heart; Sweetbreads; Kidneys; Skirts; and three kinds of Tripe, the Double, the Roll, and the Red Tripe.</p>
<p>Ox beef is considered the best. The flesh should feel tender, be fine in the grain, and of a bright red color, nicely marbled or mixed with fat. The fat should be white, rather than of a yellow color.</p>
<p>Heifer beef is excellent when finely fed, and is most suitable for small families. The bone should be taken out of a round of beef before it is salted, and it must be washed, skewered, and bound round firmly before being boiled. <ingredient>Salt beef</ingredient> should be put on with 
 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=53"/>

plenty of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and when it boils the scum removed. It is then kept simmering for some hours. A piece weighing fifteen pounds will require three hours and a half to boil. <ingredient>Carrots</ingredient> and <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> for garnishing should be put on to boil with the <ingredient>beef.</ingredient> If in the least tainted, a piece of <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> may be boiled with it.</p>
<p>When beef is to be kept any length of time, it should be carefully wiped every day. In warm weather, <ingredient>wood vinegar</ingredient> is an excellent preservative: it is put all over the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with a brush. To protect the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from flies, it may be sprinkled over with <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient> <ingredient>Tainted meat</ingredient> may be restored by washing in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> afterwards in strong <ingredient>chamomile tea,</ingredient> after which it may be sprinkled with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and used the following day, first washing it in <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Roughly pounded <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> rubbed all over the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> also restores it when tainted. In <ingredient>Scotland meat</ingredient> is frequently kept a fortnight smothered in <ingredient>oatmeal,</ingredient> and carefully wiped every day; and if it should be a little tainted, it is soaked some hours before it is used, in <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> and <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>These directions equally apply to all sorts of meat. The sirloin is the prime joint for roasting. When to be used, it should be washed, then dried with a clean cloth, and the fat covered over with a piece of white paper tied on with thread. The spit should be kept at all times exceedingly clean: it must be wiped dry immediately after it is drawn from the meat, and washed and scoured every time it is used. Care should be taken to balance the roast properly upon the spit, but, if not exactly right, it is better to make it equal by fastening on a leaden-headed <implement>skewer</implement> than to pierce it again. The fire should be prepared by putting on plenty of coals at the back. When put down, it should be about ten inches from the fire, and gradually drawn nearer. It is first basted with a little <ingredient>butter or fresh dripping</ingredient>, and then well basted with its own <ingredient>fat</ingredient> all the time it is roasting. Ten minutes before serving, it should be sprinkled with a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then dredged with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and basted till it is frothed. When it is drawn from the spit some <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> will run out, to which may be added a little boiling <ingredient>salt-and-water</ingredient> poured along the <ingredient>bone</ingredient>: the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is then garnished with plenty of finely scraped <ingredient>horse-radish.</ingredient> A <ingredient>sirloin,</ingredient> weighing about fifteen pounds, should be roasted for three hours and a half. A thinner piece of the same weight requires only three hours. In cold weather meat requires longer roasting than in warm, and if newly killed than if it has been kept.</p>

In plain English, is understood to mean boiled beef; but its culinary acceptation, in the French kitchen, is fresh beef dressed without boiling, and only very gently simmered by a slow fire. Cooks have seldom any notion, that good soup can be made without destroying a great deal of meat; however, by a judicious regulation of the fire, and a vigilant attendance on the <implement>soup-kettle,</implement> this may be accomplished. You shall have a <implement>tureen</implement> of such soup as will satisfy the most fastidious palate, and the meat make its appearance at table, at the same time, in possession of a full portion of nutritious succulence. This requires nothing more than to stew the meat very slowly (instead of keeping the pot boiling a gallop, as common cooks too commonly do), and to take it up as soon as it is done enough. See "Soup and bouilli," "Beef Shin stewed," "Scotch barley broth." Meat cooked in this manner affords much more nourishment than it does dressed in the common way, is easy of digestion in proportion as it is tender, and an invigorating, substantial diet, especially valuable to the poor, whose laborious employments require support.</p>

Is so simple and easy to prepare, that it is a matter of general surprise, that what is done so often, is so seldom done right. It is spoiled nine times out of ten, more from idleness than from ignorance, and rather because the cook won't than because she can't do it; which can only be the case when housekeepers will not allow butter to do it with. Good melted butter cannot be made with mere flour and water; there must be a full and proper proportion of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> As it must be always on the table, and is the foundation of almost all our sauces, we have, <ingredient>Melted butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> _________________ <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> _________________ <ingredient>anchovies,</ingredient> _________________ <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> _________________ shrimps, _________________ <ingredient>lobsters,</ingredient> _________________ <ingredient>capers,</ingredient> &#38;c. &#38;c. &#38;c. I have tried every way of making it; and I trust, that I have written a receipt, (3) which, if the cook will carefully observe, she will constantly succeed in giving satisfaction. In the quantities of the various sauces I have ordered, I have had in view the providing for a family of half a dozen moderate people. Never pour sauce over meat or even put it into the dish; however well made, some of the company may have an antipathy to it; tastes are as different as faces: moreover, if it is sent up separate in a boat, it will keep hot longer, and what is left may be put by for another time, or used for another purpose.</p>

Plum, seed cakes, and all large kinds, must be well soaked, and therefore do not require a brisk oven. To preserve their color, a sheet of white paper is put over them, and after they have risen and become firm, they are turned round. To ascertain if a large cake be sufficiently done, a broad bladed knife is plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and clean when drawn out, the cake is baked; but if anything adheres to the blade, it must instantly be returned to the oven, and the door closed.

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">FISH.</purpose>

<emph rend="italic">We insert all the best remarks that various culinary authors have made on FISH.</emph></p>
<p>There is a general rule in choosing most kinds of fish; if their gills are red, their eyes plump, and the whole fish stiff, they are good; if, on the contrary, the gills are pale, the eyes sunk, and the fish flabby, they are stale. The greatest care should be taken that the fish is properly cleansed before being dressed, but not washed beyound what is absolutely necessary for cleaning, as by perpetual watering, the flavour is diminished. When clean, if the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is to be boiled, some <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> should be put into the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> to give it firmness. Care should be taken to boil the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> well, but not to let it break. <ingredient>Cod,</ingredient> <ingredient>whiting,</ingredient> and <ingredient>haddock</ingredient> are much better for being a little salted, and kept for a day.</p>
<p>There is often a muddy smell and taste attached to fresh-water fish, which may be got rid of by soaking it, after it has been thoroughly cleaned in strong <ingredient>salt and water;</ingredient> or, if the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is not too large, scald it in the same; then dry, and dress it.</p>
<p>Care should be taken that the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is put into <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and allowed to do very gently, otherwise the outside will break before the inside is done.</p>
<p>Crimp <ingredient>fish</ingredient> must be put into <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> and as soon as it boils up, a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> should be put in, to check the excessive heat, and simmer it for a few minutes.</p>
<p>If the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is not taken out of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> the instant it is done, it will become woolly; to ascertain when it is ready, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> plate on which it is dressed may be drawn up, and if sufficiently done, it will leave the bone. To keep hot for serving, and to prevent it from losing its color, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> plate should be placed crossways over the <implement>fish-kettle,</implement> and a clean cloth put over the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient></p>
<p>Small <ingredient>fish</ingredient> may be either nicely fried plain, or done over with <ingredient>egg</ingredient> and <ingredient>bread</ingredient> crumbs, and then fried. Upon the dish on which the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is to be served, should be 
 
<pb n="74" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=116"/>

placed a folded damask napkin, and upon this put the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> with the <ingredient>liver</ingredient> and <ingredient>roe;</ingredient> then garnish the dish with <ingredient>horse-radish,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon.</ingredient> <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> is a dish which is almost more attended to than any other.</p>
<p>To fry or broil <ingredient>fish</ingredient> properly, after it is well cleaned and washed, it should be wrapped in a nice soft cloth, and when perfectly dry, wetted with <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and sprinkled all over with very fine <ingredient>bread</ingredient> crumbs; it will look still better to be done over with <ingredient>egg</ingredient> and <ingredient>crumbs</ingredient> a second time. Then having on the fire a thick-bottomed frying-pan, with plenty of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>dripping,</ingredient> boiling hot; put the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> into it, and let it fry tolerably quick till it is done, and of a nice brown yellow. If it is done before it has obtained a nice brown color, the pan should be drawn to the side of the fire, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> carefully taken up, and placed either upon a sieve turned upwards, or on the under side of a dish, and placed before the fire to drain, and finish browning; if wanted particularly nice, a sheet of <implement>cap paper</implement> must be put to receive the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> fried in <ingredient>oil</ingredient> obtains a much finer color than when done in <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>dripping.</ingredient> Butter should never be used, as it gives a bad color. Garnish your dish with a fringe of curled raw <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> or with fried <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient></p>
<p>When <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is to be broiled, it must be seasoned, floured, and done on a very clean <implement>gridiron;</implement> which, when hot, should be rubbed over with <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> to hinder the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> from sticking. It should be broiled over a very clear fire, to prevent its tasting smoky, and great care must be taken not to scorch it.</p>
<p>FISH. This department of the business of the kitchen requires considerable experience, and depends more upon practice than any other. A very few moments, more or less, will thoroughly spoil fish; which, to be eaten in perfection, must never be put on the table till the soup is taken off.</p>
<p>So many circumstances operate on this occasion; that it is almost impossible to write general rules.</p>
<p>There are decidedly different opinions, whether fish should be put into cold, tepid, or boiling water.</p>
<p>Fish must by no means be allowed to remain in the water after it is boiled; if therefore it should be ready before it can be sent to table, it must be dished, the cover put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish is then to be set across the <implement>fish-kettle.</implement></p>
<p><ingredient>Fish</ingredient> should be fried over a clear quick fire; and with <ingredient>dripping,</ingredient> or <ingredient>hog's lard</ingredient> in preference to butter. The pan should be deep; and to ascertain that it is clean, a little <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is first fried in it, poured out, and the pan wiped with a clean cloth; as much <ingredient>dripping</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is then put in as will entirely cover the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> When it is boiling hot, and begins to smoke, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is put in; if small, they may be turned in three or four minutes, by sticking in a fork near the head with one hand, and with the other supporting the tail with a <implement>fish-slice.</implement> When they are done, they should be laid before the fire upon an old soft towel, and turned now and then till they are dry upon both sides; or they may be put upon a large sieve, turned upwards, and which is kept for the purpose, or put on the under side of a dish.</p>
<p>The fire for broiling <ingredient>fish</ingredient> must be very clear, and the <implement>gridiron</implement> perfectly clean, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> The <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> while broiling, must be often turned.</p>
<p>Several respectable fishmongers and experienced cooks have assured the editor, that they are often in danger of losing their credit by fish too fresh, and especially turbot and <ingredient>cod,</ingredient> which, like <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> require a certain time before they are in the best condition to be dressed. They recommend them to be put into <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> salted in proportion of about a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to a gallon of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> <ingredient>Sea-water</ingredient> is best to boil <ingredient>sea-fish</ingredient> in. It not only saves the expense of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> but the flavor is better. Let them boil slowly till done; the sign of which is, that the skin of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> rises up, and the eyes turn <ingredient>white.</ingredient></p>
<p>It is the business of the fishmonger to clean them, &#38;c. but the careful cook will always wash them again.</p>
<p>Garnish with slices of <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> finely scraped <ingredient>horseradish,</ingredient> fried <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>smelts,</ingredient> whitings or strips of <ingredient>soles.</ingredient></p>
<p>The <ingredient>liver,</ingredient> <ingredient>roe,</ingredient> and chitterlings should be placed so that the carver may observe them, and invite the guest to partake of them.</p>
<p><ingredient>Fish,</ingredient> like <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> requires more cooking in cold than in warm weather. If it becomes FROZEN, it must be thawed by the means we have directed for <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Fish</ingredient> are plenty and good, and in great variety, in all the towns and cities on the extensive coast of the United States. Some of the interior towns are also supplied with <ingredient>fish</ingredient> peculiar to the lakes and rivers of this country.</p>
<p>All kinds of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are best sometime before they begin to spawn; and are unfit for food for sometime after they have spawned.</p>
<p><ingredient>Fish,</ingredient> like animals, are fittest for the table when they are just full grown; and what has been said respecting vegetables, applies equally well to <ingredient>fish.</ingredient></p>
<p>The most convenient utensil to boil <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in, is a <implement>turbot-kettle.</implement> This should be twenty-four inches long, twenty-two wide, and nine deep. It is an excellent vessel to boil a <ingredient>ham</ingredient> in, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>
<p>N.B.--The <ingredient>liver</ingredient> of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> pounded and

mixed with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> &#38;c. is an elegant and inoffensive relish to <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> <ingredient>Mushroom sauce</ingredient> extempore or the soup of mock turtle, will make an excellent fish sauce.</p>
<p>For liquids, you have <ingredient>meat gravy,</ingredient> <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> <ingredient>sirup of lemons,</ingredient> <ingredient>essence of anchovy,</ingredient> the various <ingredient>vegetable essences,</ingredient> <ingredient>mushroom catchup,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks of eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>wines,</ingredient> and the essence of <ingredient>spices.</ingredient></p>

<p>The poignancy of forcemeat should be proportioned to the savouriness of the viands, to which it is intended to give an additional zest. Some dishes require a very delicately flavored forcemeat, for others, it must 
 
<pb n="77" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=119"/>

be full and high seasoned. What would be <emph rend="italic">piquante</emph> in a turkey, would be insipid with turtle.</p>
<p>Most people have an acquired and peculiar taste in stuffings, &#38;c. and what exactly pleases one, seldom is precisely what another considers the most agreeable.</p>
<p>Custom is all in matters of taste: it is not that one person is naturally fond of this or that, and another naturally averse to it; but that one is used to it, and another is not.</p>
<p>The consistency of forcemeats is rather a difficult thing to manage; they are almost always either too light or too heavy.</p>
<p>Take care to pound it till perfectly smooth, and that all the ingredients are thoroughlyincorporated.</p>
<p>Forcemeat-balls must not be larger than a small nutmeg. If they are for brown sauce, <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and fry them; if for white, put them into boiling <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and boil them for three minutes: the latter are by far the most delicate.</p>
<p>If not of sufficient stiffness, it falls to pieces, and makes soup, &#38;c. grouty and very unsightly.</p>
<p><ingredient>Sweetbreads</ingredient> and <ingredient>tongues</ingredient> are the favorite materials for forcemeat. Forcemeat should be made sufficiently consistent to cut with a knife, but not dry or heavy. No one flavor should predominate greatly; according to what it is wanted for, a selection may be made from the following list, being careful to use the least of those articles which are the most pungent:</p>
<p><ingredient>Cold fowl,</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> scraped <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>fat bacon,</ingredient> <ingredient>beef suet,</ingredient> <ingredient>crumbs of bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> <ingredient>white pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and <ingredient>whites of eggs,</ingredient> well beaten, to bind the mixture.</p>
<p>The forcemeat may be made with any of these articles without any striking flavor; therefore any of the following different ingredients may be made use of to vary the taste.</p>
<p><ingredient>Oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>anchovies,</ingredient> <ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient> <ingredient>savory,</ingredient> <ingredient>penny-royal,</ingredient> <ingredient>knotted-marjoram,</ingredient> <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> <ingredient>basil,</ingredient> <ingredient>yolks of hard eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> <ingredient>garlic,</ingredient> <ingredient>shallots,</ingredient> <ingredient>chives,</ingredient> <ingredient>Jamaica pepper</ingredient> in fine powder, or two or three <ingredient>cloves.</ingredient></p>

When a cock is young, his spurs are short; take care that you are not deceived by their having been cut or pared, a trick that is often practised. If fresh their vent will be close and dark. Hens are best, just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of egg; if they are old, their combs and legs are rough.</p>
<p>All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug removed, and the hair nicely singed with paper.</p>
<p>The cook should be careful in drawing poultry of all sorts, not to break the gallbag, for no washing will take off the bitter where it has touched.</p>
<p>If for roasting, <ingredient>black-legged fowls</ingredient> are the most moist.

<p><ingredient>Tame fowls</ingredient> require more roasting, and are longer in heating through than others.

In choosing venison, the fat of that which is good is thick, clear, and bright; the clift part smooth and close. When the venison is perfectly fresh, it is hung in a cool place, and carefully wiped dry every day. When extreme tenderness is required from long keeping, but without its having a high flavor, it is well rubbed over with <ingredient>powdered charcoal.</ingredient></p>
<p>The haunch is the prime joint, and when it is required to be roasted, it is first well washed in lukewarm <ingredient>milk</ingredient>-and-<ingredient>water,</ingredient> and then made quite dry before it is spitted. It is then covered with a sheet of well-buttered white paper, over which is laid a <ingredient>coarse paste</ingredient> of <ingredient>flour</ingredient>-and-<ingredient>water,</ingredient> about a quarter of an inch thick; this is again covered with buttered white paper, and tied on with pack-thread. A substantial fire being made, the haunch is put down, and constantly basted with fresh <ingredient>beef dripping,</ingredient> till nearly done, when the paste is taken off, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> well basted with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and lightly dredged with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> till it froths and becomes of a fine light brown color.

<p>A large haunch takes about four hours to roast.</p>
<p>A <ingredient>neck and shoulder,</ingredient> when roasted, is managed in the same way as the haunch, omitting the paste; but it is more frequently used for soups, pasties, and collops.</p>
<p>Hare.--When fresh, the body is stiff; and if young, the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears tender and easily torn. Hares are kept from a week to a fortnight for roasting; but for soup, they cannot have been too recently killed.</p>
<p>Rabbits are chosen by the same rules as hares.</p>
<p>Wild fowl, in general, is chosen by the same rules as tame poultry. The birds should be plump and fat,and hard in the vent. If the skin comes off when rubbed hard with the finger, they are stale. Old birds improve by keeping for sometime; young birds are best if dressed soon; and small birds, of all descriptions, should be immediately dressed. In warm weather, a stopper of charcoal should be put into the vent of all game, and a string tied tightly round the neck.</p>
<p>To roast <ingredient>pheasants</ingredient> and <ingredient>partridges,</ingredient> they are picked, cleaned, and nicely singed; a slit is made in the back part of the neck, and the craw taken out, leaving on the head, the feet twisted closely to the body, the claws cut off, and the head turned under the wing. Both sorts are roasted by the directions for roasting a <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> or a <ingredient>fowl.</ingredient> A <ingredient>pheasant</ingredient> is served with <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> in the dish; <ingredient>partridges</ingredient> with a <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> or laid upon buttered toast, and <ingredient>melted butter</ingredient> poured round them. <ingredient>Bread sauce</ingredient> is served with both.

<p>To restore tainted <ingredient>game</ingredient> or poultry, pick it carefully, clean, and wash it, then put into each bird a little newly-made <ingredient>pounded charcoal,</ingredient> tied in a bit of muslin. Before serving, take out the bag, which will have a most offensive smell, while the bird will be left perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>To roast <ingredient>wild duck.</ingredient>--It should be roasted by a quick fire, well basted with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and browned.

<p>To roast a <ingredient>wild goose,</ingredient> the same directions are followed as for <ingredient>wild duck,</ingredient> allowing more time to roast it, according to the size of the bird.</p>
<p><ingredient>Widgeons</ingredient> and <ingredient>teal</ingredient>are dressed in the same manner as the <ingredient>wild duck,</ingredient> and are roasted in ten minutes, and may be served upon <ingredient>fried bread crumbs.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Woodcocks</ingredient> and snipes are roasted without being drawn; a piece of <ingredient>toasted bread</ingredient> buttered is put under each bird, to catch the trail; they are well basted with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and served upon the hot toast over which they were roasted; a rich <ingredient>brown gravy,</ingredient> or <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> is poured round them. <ingredient>Woodcocks</ingredient>

<p>Ortolans and green plovers are not drawn, and are roasted and served in the same manner as woodcocks.</p>
<p>To roast <ingredient>larks,</ingredient> <ingredient>wheatears,</ingredient> and other small birds, they are nicely picked, gutted, cleaned, and trussed; brushed over with <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> and rolled in <ingredient>grated bread,</ingredient> then spitted on a <implement>bird spit,</implement> which is fastened upon a larger one.

It is of as much importance that the cook should know how to make a boat of good gravy for poultry, &#38;c. as that it should be sent up of proper complexion, and nicely frothed.</p>
<p>We shall endeavor to introduce to her all the materials which give flavor in <emph rend="italic">sauce</emph> which is the <emph rend="italic">essence of soup,</emph> and intended to contain more relish in a <emph rend="italic">tea-spoonful</emph> than the former does in a <emph rend="italic">table-spoonful.</emph></p>
<p>We hope to deserve as much praise from the <emph rend="italic">economist</emph> as we do from the <emph rend="italic">bon vivant;</emph> as we have taken great pains to introduce to him the methods of making substitutes for those ingredients, which are always expensive, and often not to be had at all. Many of these cheap articles are as savory and as salutary as the dearer ones, and those who have large families and limited incomes, will, no doubt, be glad to avail themselves of them.</p>
<p>The reader may rest assured, that whether he consults this book to diminish the expense or increase the pleasures of hospitality, he will find all the information that was to be obtained up to 1832, communicated in the most unreserved and intelligible manner.</p>
<p>A great deal of the elegance of cookery depends upon the accompaniments to each dish being appropriate and well adapted to it.</p>
<p>We can assure our readers, no attention has been wanting on our part to render this department of the work worthy of their perusal; each receipt is the faithful narrative of actual and repeated experiments, and has received the most deliberate consideration before it was here presented to them. It is given in the most circumstantial manner, and not in the technical and mysterious language former writers on these subjects seem to have preferred; by which their directions are useless and unintelligible to all who have not regularly served an apprenticeship at the stove.</p>
<p>It will be to very little purpose that I have taken so much pains to teach how to manage roasts and boils, if a cook cannot or will not make the several sauces that are usually sent up with them.</p>
<p>We have therefore endeavored to give the plainest directions how to produce, with the least trouble and expense possible, all the various compositions the English kitchen affords; and hope to present such a wholesome and palatable variety as will suit all tastes and all pockets, so that a cook may give satisfaction in all families. The more combinations of this sort she is acquainted with, the better she will comprehend the management of every one of them.</p>
<p>Let your sauces each display a decided character; send up your plain sauces (oyster, lobster, &#38;c.) as pure as possible: they should only taste of the materials from which they take their name.</p>
<p>The imagination of most cooks is so incessantly on the hunt for a relish, that they seem to think they cannot make sauce sufficiently savor without putting into it everything that ever was eaten; and supposing every addition must be an improvement, they frequently overpower the natural flavor of their PLAIN SAUCES, by overloading them with salt and spices, &#38;c.: but, remember, these will be deteriorated by any addition, save only just salt enough to awaken the palate.</p>
<p>On the contrary, of COMPOUND SAUCES; the ingredients should be so nicely proportioned, that no one be predominant; so that from the equal union of the combined flavors such a fine mellow mixture is produced, whose very novelty cannot fail of being acceptable to the persevering gourmand, if it has not pretensions to a permanent place at his table.</p>
<p>An ingenious <emph rend="italic">cook</emph> will form as endless a variety of these compositions as a <emph rend="italic">musician</emph> with his seven notes, or a <emph rend="italic">painter</emph> with his colors; no part of her business offers so fair and frequent an opportunity to display her abilities: SPICES, HERBS, &#38;c. are often very absurdly and injudiciously jumbled together.</p>
<p>Why have clove and allspice, or mace and nutmeg, in the same sauce; or marjoram, thyme, and savory; or onions, leeks, eschalots, and garlic? one will very well supply the place of the other, and the frugal cook may save something considerable by attending to this, to the advantage of her employers, and her own time and trouble.</p>

<p>The common method is, when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is in the dish you intend to send it up in, to mix half a tea-spoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in a quarter pint of boiling <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and to drop some of this over the corners and underside of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and to pour the rest through the hole the spit came out of: some pierce the inferior parts of the joints with a sharp <implement>skewer.</implement></p>

<p>Give it plenty of water-room, and put it in while the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is cold; let it heat very gradually, and let it be on the fire an hour and a half before it comes to a boil; let it be well skimmed, and keep it simmering very gently: a middling-sized <ingredient>ham</ingredient> of fifteen pounds will be done enough in about four or five hours, according to its thickness.</p>
<p>If not to be cut till cold, it will cut the shorter and tenderer for being boiled about half an hour longer. In a very small family, where a <ingredient>ham</ingredient> will last a week or ten days, it is best economy not to cut it till it is cold, it will be infinitely more juicy.</p>

It is very important to those who are not in the constant habit of attending the markets to know when the various seasons commence for purchasing sweet herbs.</p>
<p>All vegetables are in the highest state of perfection, and fullest of juice and flavor, just before they begin to flower: the first and last crop have neither the fine flavor, nor the perfume of those which are gathered in the height of the season; that is, when

the greater part of the crop of each species is ripe.</p>
<p>Take care they are gathered on a dry day, by which means they will have a better color when dried. Cleanse your <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> well from dirt and dust; cut off the roots; separate the bunches into smaller ones, and dry them by the heat of a stove, or in a <implement>Dutch oven</implement> before a common fire, in such quantities at a time, that the process may be speedily finished; <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> 'Kill 'em quick,' says a great-botanist; by this means their flavor will be best preserved: there can be no doubt of the propriety of drying <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> &#38;c. hastily by the aid of artificial heat, rather than by the heat of the sun. In the application of artificial heat, the only caution requisite is to avoid burning; and of this a sufficient test is afforded by the preservation of the color. The common custom is, when they are perfectly dried to put them in bags, and lay them in a dry place; but the best way to <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> the flavor of aromatic plants is to pick off the leaves as soon as they are dried, and to pound them, and put them through a <implement>hair sieve,</implement> and keep them in well-stopped bottles. The common custom is to put them into paper bags, and lay them on a shelf in the kitchen, exposed to all the fumes, steam, and smoke, &#38;c.: thus they soon lose their flavor.</p>
<p>N.B. <ingredient>Herbs</ingredient> nicely dried are a very acceptable substitute when fresh ones cannot be got; but, however carefully dried, the flavor and fragrance of the fresh <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> are incomparably finer.</p>

Buy these alive; the lobster merchants sometimes keep them till they are starved, before they boil them; they are then watery, have not half their flavor, and like other persons that die of a consumption, have lost the calf of their legs. Choose those that (as an old cook says, are "heavy and lively," and) are full of motion, which is the index of their freshness. Those of the middle size are the best. Never take them when the shell is incrusted, which is a sign they are old. The male <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> is preferred to eat, and the female (on account of the eggs) to make sauce of. The hen lobster is distinguished by having a broader tail than the male, and less claws. Set on a pot, with <ingredient>water</ingredient> salted in proportion of a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to a quart of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boils, put it in, and keep it boiling briskly from half an hour to an hour, according to its size; wipe all the scum off it, and rub the shell with a very little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet oil;</ingredient> break off the great claws, crack them carefully in each joint, so that they may not be shattered, and yet come to pieces easily; cut the tail down the middle, and send up the body whole.</p>

, <emph rend="italic">to choose.</emph> The heaviest are considered the best. When alive, if they are quite fresh, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press them. When you buy them ready boiled, try whether their tails are stiff and pull up with a spring, otherwise that part will be flabby. The cock-lobster may be distinguished from the hen by the narrow back part of the tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally the smallest, has the highest flavor, the flesh is firmer, and the color when boiled is a deeper red. They come in about April, and remain in season till the oysters return. Hen lobsters are preferred for sauces, on account of their coral.</p>

Blanch a pound of <ingredient>sweet almonds,</ingredient> throw them into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for a few minutes, lay them in a napkin to dry, and leave them for twenty-four hours; at the end of that time, pound them, a handful at a time, adding occasionally some <ingredient>white of egg,</ingredient> till the whole is reduced to a fine <ingredient>paste;</ingredient> then take two pounds of the best <ingredient>lump sugar,</ingredient> pound and sift it, then put it to the <ingredient>almonds,</ingredient> with the <ingredient>grated rinds</ingredient> of two <ingredient>lemons;</ingredient> beat these ingredients together in the <implement>mortar,</implement> adding one at a time, as many <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> as you find necessary to moisten the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> which should be thin, but not too much so, as in that case it would run; your <ingredient>paste</ingredient> being ready, take out a little in a spoon, and lay the <ingredient>macaroons</ingredient> on sheets of white paper either round or oval, as you please; lay them at least an inch apart, because they spread in baking, and if put nearer would touch. The whole of your <ingredient>paste</ingredient> being used, place the sheets of paper on tins in a moderate oven for three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<p>This kind of cake requires great care and attention; it will be well therefore to take notice of the following rules: 1. To mind that the <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> are perfectly dry before you begin to pound them. 2. Take great care that not a particle of the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> is mixed with the <ingredient>white of egg,</ingredient> which would entirely 
 
<pb n="114" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=156"/>

spoil the color of the <ingredient>macaroons,</ingredient> and prevent their rising in the oven; to avoid this, open each separately, and if perfectly fresh, divide the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> and <ingredient>white</ingredient> with great care. 3. The oven must be no more than moderately heated, nothing being more liable to burn than <ingredient>almonds</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> by the least negligence in this respect, the surface would be burned, whilst the inside would remain unbaked. The best method to obviate any mischief of this sort:--put two or three <ingredient>macaroons</ingredient> into the oven to try it; leave them in the usual time; and if, when you take them out, they are of a clear yellow, the oven is properly heated, and the whole of the <ingredient>macaroons</ingredient> may then be put in.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">MUSHROOMS, TO CHOOSE. </purpose>

The mushrooms proper to be used in cookery grow in the open pasture land, for those that grow near or under trees, are poisonous. The eatable mushrooms first appear very small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. They grow very rapidly, and the upper part and stalk are white. As they increase in size, the under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very fine salmon color, which continues more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edge and middle, and whether they have a pleasant smell. Those which are poisonous have a yellow skin, and the under part has not the clear flesh color of the real mushroom; besides which, they smell rank and disagreeable, and the fur is white or yellow.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">MUSHROOM KETCHUP.</purpose>

If you love good ketchup, gentle reader, make it yourself, after the following directions, and you will have a delicious relish for made dishes, ragouts, soups, sauces, or hashes.</p>
<p>Mushroom gravy approaches the nature and flavor of meat gravy, more than any vegetable juice, and is the superlative substitute for it: in meagre soups and extempore gravies, the chemistry of the kitchen has yet contrived to agreeably awaken the palate, and encourage the appetite.</p>
<p>A couple of quarts of double ketchup, made according to the following receipt, will save you some score pounds of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> besides a vast deal of time and trouble; as it will furnish, in a few minutes, as good sauce as can be made for either <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>flesh,</ingredient> or <ingredient>fowl.</ingredient></p>
<p>I believe the following is the best way of extracting and preparing the essence of mushrooms, so as to procure and preserve their flavor for a considerable length of time.</p>
<p>Look out for mushrooms from the beginning of September.</p>
<p>Take care they are the right sort, and fresh gathered. Full-grown flaps are to be preferred: put a layer of these at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and sprinkle them with <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> then another layer of <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> and some more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on them; and so on alternately, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient>: let them remain two or three hours, by which time the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will have penetrated the <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> and rendered them easy to break; then pound them in a <implement>mortar,</implement> or mash them well with your hands, and let them remain for a couple of days, not longer, stirring them up, and mashing them well each day; then pour them into a stone jar, and to each quart add an ounce and a half of whole <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> and half an ounce of <ingredient>allspice;</ingredient> stop the jar very close, and set it in a <implement>stewpan</implement> of boiling <ingredient>water</ingredient> and keep it boiling for two hours at least. Take out the jar, and pour the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> clear 
 
<pb n="118" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=160"/>

from the settlings through a <implement>hair sieve</implement> (without squeezing the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient>) into a clean <implement>stewpan;</implement> let it boil very gently for half an hour: those who are for superlative <ingredient>ketchup,</ingredient> will continue the boiling till the <ingredient>mushroom-juice</ingredient> is reduced to half the quantity; it may then be called double cat-sup or dog-sup.</p>
<p>There are several advantages attending this concentration; it will keep much better, and only half the quantity be required; so you can flavor sauce, &#38;c. without thinning it: neither is this an extravagant way of making it, for merely the aqueous part is evaporated; skim it well, and pour it into a clean dry jar, or jug; cover it close, and let it stand in a cool place till next day; then pour it off as gently as possible (so as not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the jug,) through a <implement>tamis,</implement> or thick <implement>flannel bag,</implement> till it is perfectly clear; add a table-spoonful of good <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> to each pint of ketchup, and let it stand as before; a fresh sediment will be deposited, from which the ketchup is to be quietly pour off, and bottled in pints or half pints (which have been washed with <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> or <ingredient>spirit</ingredient>): it is best to keep it in such quantities as are soon used.</p>
<p>Take especial care that it is closely corked, and sealed down, or dipped in bottle cement.</p>
<p>If kept in a cool, dry place, it may be preserved for a long time; but if it be badly corked, and kept in a damp place, it will soon spoil.</p>
<p>Examine it from time to time, by placing a strong light behind the neck of the bottle, and if any pellicle appears about it, boil it up again with a few peppercorns.</p>

The pipe that runs along the bone of the inside of a chine of <ingredient>mutton</ingredient> ought to be taken away; and if it is to be kept any length of time, the part close round the tail should be rubbed with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> previously cutting out the kernel.</p>
<p>It is best for the butcher to take out the kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg, as that is the part most likely to become tainted. The chine and rib-bones should be wiped every day; and the bloody part of the neck be cut off, in order to preserve it. The brisket changes first in the breast; therefore, if it is to be kept, it is best, should the weather be hot, to rub it with a little <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>

<p><emph rend="italic">A Leg,</emph> of eight pounds, will take about two hours: let it be well basted, and frothed.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">A Chine or Saddle,</emph> <emph rend="italic">(i.e.</emph> the two loins) of ten or eleven pounds, two hours and a half: it is the business of the butcher to take off the skin and skewer it on again, to defend the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from extreme heat, and <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> its succulence; if this is neglected, tie a sheet of paper over it (baste the strings you tie it on with directly, or they will burn): about a quarter of an hour before you think it will be done, take off the skin or paper, that it may get a pale brown color, then baste it and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> it lightly to froth it. N.B. Desire the butcher to cut off the flaps and the tail and chump end, and trim away every part that has not indisputable pretensions to be eaten. This will reduce a saddle of eleven pounds weight to about six or seven pounds.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">A Neck,</emph> about the same time as a loin. It must be carefully jointed, or it is very difficult to carve. The neck and breast are, in small families, commonly roasted together; the cook will then crack the bones across the middle before they are put down to roast: if this is not done carefully, they are very troublesome to carve. Tell the cook, when she takes it from the spit, to separate them before she sends them to table. N.B.

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">OMELETS AND VARIOUS WAYS OF DRESSING EGGS. </purpose>

There is no dish which may be considered as coming under the denomination of a made dish of the second order, which is so generally eaten, if good, as an omelet; and no one is so often badly dressed: it is a very faithful assistant in the construction of a dinner.</p>
<p>When you are taken by surprise, and wish to make an appearance beyond what is provided for the every-day dinner, a little p<ingredient>ortable soup</ingredient> melted down, and some <ingredient>zest</ingredient> and a few <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> will make a good broth; a pot of stewed <ingredient>veal</ingredient> warmed up; an omelet; and some <ingredient>apple</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon fritters,</ingredient> can all be got ready at ten minutes notice, and with the original foundation of a <ingredient>leg of mutton,</ingredient> or a piece of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> will make up a very good dinner when company unexpectedly arrives, in the country.</p>
<p>The great merit of an omelet is, that it should not be greasy, burnt, nor too much done: if too much of the <ingredient>white of the eggs</ingredient> is left in, no art can prevent its being hard, if it is done: to dress the omelet, the fire should not be too hot, as it is an object to have the whole substance heated, without much browning the outside.</p>
<p>One of the great errors in cooking an omelet is, that it is too thin; consequently, instead of feeling full and moist in the mouth, the substance presented is little better than a piece of fried leather: to get the omelet thick is one of the great objects. With respect to the flavors to be introduced, these are infinite; that which is most common, however, is the best, viz. finely chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> and <ingredient>chives</ingredient> or <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> or <ingredient>eschalots:</ingredient> however, one made of a mixture of <ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient> <ingredient>chervil,</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> is a very delicate variety, omitting or adding the <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or <ingredient>chives.</ingredient> Of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> flavors, the <ingredient>veal kidney</ingredient> is the most delicate, and is the most admired by the French: this should be cut in dice, and should be dressed (boiled) before it is added; in the same manner, <ingredient>ham</ingredient> and <ingredient>anchovies,</ingredient> shred small, or <ingredient>tongue,</ingredient> will make a very delicately flavored dish.</p>
<p>The objection to an omelet is, that it is too rich, which makes it advisable to eat but a small quantity. An addition of some finely mashed <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> about two table-spoonfuls, to an omelet of six <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> will much lighten it.</p>
<p>Omelets are often served with rich <ingredient>gravy;</ingredient> but, as a general principle, no substance which has been fried should be served in <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> but accompanied by it, or what ought to eat dry and crisp, becomes soddened and flat.</p>
<p>In the compounding the <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> great care should be taken that the flavor does not overcome that of the omelet, a thing too little attended to: a fine <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> with a flavoring of <ingredient>sweet herbs</ingredient> and <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> we think the best; some add a few drops of <ingredient>tarragon vinegar;</ingredient> but this is to be done only with great care: <ingredient>gravies</ingredient> to omelets are in general thickened: this should never be done with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> <ingredient>potato starch,</ingredient> or <ingredient>arrow-root,</ingredient> is the best.</p>
<p>Omelets should be fried in a small frying-pan made for that purpose, with a small quantity of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The omelet's great merit is to be thick, so as not to taste of the outside; therefore use only half the number of whites that you do <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient>: every care must be taken in frying, even at the risk of not having it quite set in the middle: an omelet, which has so much vogue abroad, is here, in general, a thin doubled up piece of leather, and harder than soft leather sometimes. The fact is, that as much 
 
<pb n="125" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=167"/>

care must be bestowed on the frying, as should be taken in poaching an <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> A <implement>salamander</implement> is necessary to those who will have the top brown; but the <implement>kitchen shovel</implement> may be substituted for it.</p>
<p>The following receipt is the basis of all omelets, of which you may make an endless variety, by taking, instead of the <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> and eschalot, a portion of <ingredient>sweet herbs,</ingredient> or any of the articles used for making forcemeats, or any of the forcemeats.</p>
<p>Omelets are called by the name of what is added to flavor them: a <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> omelet; an <ingredient>anchovy,</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal kidney omelet,</ingredient> &#38;c.: these are prepared exactly in the same way as in the first receipt, leaving out the parsley and eschalot, and mincing the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>kidney</ingredient> very fine, &#38;c., and adding that in the place of them, and then pour over them all sorts of thickened <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> sauces, &#38;c.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">OVEN, DIRECTIONS FOR THE.</purpose>

Be very careful to keep your oven clean, and that there are no remains of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> or <ingredient>fat</ingredient> that may have run over from any thing that has been baking. Puff-pastes require a moderately hot oven, but not too hot, or it will spoil the shape and turn it over; <ingredient>tart-paste,</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="128" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=170"/>

or <ingredient>short crust,</ingredient> requires a slower oven; petits-bhoux, one still slower; but for raised pies, let it be as hot as for puff-paste at first, and well closed, so that the pies may not fall.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you give a dinner where paste is necessary, endeavor to make it in the morning; heat your oven first for the puff-paste, which must be baked the first; then let the oven go gradually down, and bake your pastes in rotation, as the heat falls. Savoy biscuits require a cool oven, and, by degrees, raise the heat as the biscuits are baking. For souffles or light puddings, have a gentle oven, and contrive so as to have them ready by the time they are wanted, or they will fall. The greatest attention should also be paid in heating the oven for baking cakes, particularly for those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or if it has become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the centre; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven. If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, fresh fuel must be quickly put in, and the cakes kept hot until the oven is fit to finish the soaking, but this must only be done in a case of great emergency; for those who are employed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occur from negligence.</p>

Some piscivorous gourmands think that oysters are not best when quite fresh from their beds, and that their flavor is too brackish and harsh, and is much ameliorated by giving them a feed.</p>

--Cover them with clean <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with a pint of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to about two gallons (nothing else, no oatmeal, flour, nor any other trumpery); this will cleanse them from the mud and sand, &#38;c. of the bed; after they have lain in it twelve hours, change it for fresh <ingredient>salt and water,</ingredient> and in twelve hours more they will be in prime order for the mouth, and remain so two or three days: at the time of high water you may see them open their shells, in expectation of receiving their usual food. This process of feeding oysters is only employed when a great many come up together.</p>
<p>Common people are indifferent about the manner of opening <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and the time of eating them after they are opened; nothing, however, is more important in the enlightened eyes of the experienced oyster-eater.</p>
<p>Those who wish to enjoy this delicious restorative in its utmost perfection, must eat it the moment it is opened, with its own gravy in the under shell; if not eaten while absolutely alive, its flavor and <ingredient>spirit</ingredient> are lost.</p>

, Is in prime order for the spit when about three weeks old.</p>
<p>It loses part of its goodness every hour after it is killed; if not quite fresh, no art can make the crackling crisp.</p>
<p>To be in perfection, it should be killed in the morning to be eaten at dinner: it requires very careful roasting. A sucking-pig, like a young child, must not be left for an instant.</p>
<p>The ends must have much more fire than the middle: for this purpose is contrived an iron to hang before the middle part, called a <implement>pig-iron.</implement> If you have not this, use a common <implement>flat iron,</implement> or keep the fire fiercest at the two ends.</p>
<p>For the stuffing, take of the <ingredient>crumb of a stale loaf</ingredient> about five ounces; rub it through a <implement>colander;</implement> mince fine a handful of <ingredient>sage</ingredient> (<emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> about two ounces), and a large <ingredient>onion</ingredient> (about an ounce and a half). Mix these together with an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> some <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and a bit of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> as big as an egg. Fill the belly of the pig with this, and sew it up: lay it to the fire, and baste it with <ingredient>salad oil</ingredient> till it is 
 
<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=186"/>

quite done. Do not leave it a moment: it requires the most vigilant attendance.</p>
<p>Roast it at a clear, brisk fire at some distance. To gain the praise of epicurean pig-eaters, the crackling must be nicely crisped and delicately lightly browned, without being either blistered or burnt.</p>
<p>A small, three weeks old pig will be done enough in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Before you take it from the fire, cut off the head, and part that and the body down the middle: chop the <ingredient>brains</ingredient> very fine, with some boiled <ingredient>sage leaves,</ingredient> and mix them with good <ingredient>veal gravy,</ingredient> or <ingredient>beef gravy,</ingredient> or what runs from the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> when you cut its <ingredient>head</ingredient> off. Send up a tureenful of <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> besides. <ingredient>Currant sauce</ingredient> is still a favorite with some of the old school.</p>
<p>Lay your <ingredient>pig</ingredient> back to back in the dish, with one half of the <ingredient>head</ingredient> on each side, and the ears one at each end, which you must take care to make nice and crisp; or you will get scolded, and deservedly, as the silly fellow was who bought his wife a <ingredient>pig</ingredient> with only one ear.</p>
<p>When you cut off the pettitoes, leave the skin long round the ends of the legs. When you first lay the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> before the fire, rub it all over with fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>salad oil</ingredient>: ten minutes after, and the skin looks dry; dredge it well with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> all over, let it remain on an hour, then rub it off with a soft cloth.</p>
<p>N. B. A <ingredient>pig</ingredient> is a very troublesome subject to roast; most persons have them baked. Send a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and beg the <implement>baker</implement> to baste it well.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">PORK. DAIRY-FED</purpose>

pork is the best; the flesh should look white and smooth, and the fat be white and fine. In preparing a hog for bacon, the ribs are cut, with a very little flesh on them, from the side, which has the fore and hind leg attached to it; the hind leg is then called a gammon of bacon, but it is generally reserved for a ham. On each side there is a large spare rib, which is usually divided into two, one called the sweet bone, the other the blade bone. There are also griskins, chine, or back bone.</p>
<p>Hog's lard is the inner fat of the bacon hog.</p>
<p>Porkers are not so old as hogs; they make excellent pickled pork, but are chosen more particularly for roasting.</p>
<p>To roast a leg, a small <ingredient>onion</ingredient> is minced together with three <ingredient>sage leaves,</ingredient> seasoned with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and put under the skin at the knuckle bone; the skin is cut into strips nearly half an inch apart, and rubbed over with a bit of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will require nearly three hours to roast.</p>
<p>A spare <ingredient>rib</ingredient> should be roasted, is basted with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and has <ingredient>sage leaves</ingredient> dried, rubbed to a powder, and mixed with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> sprinkled over it.</p>
<p>Both a <ingredient>loin</ingredient> and <ingredient>neck</ingredient> are jointed, the skin scored in narrow strips, and rubbed with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> If weighing six or seven pounds, it will require rather more than two hours to roast.</p>
<p>A griskin may be either broiled or roasted.</p>
<p>A chine is stuffed here and there with <ingredient>bread crumbs,</ingredient> mixed with a little <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and seasoned with some finely shred <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> and <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> some <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> The skin is cut into strips and rubbed with <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> it is then roasted, and served with <ingredient>apple sauce,</ingredient> as are also the preceding roasts.</p>
<p>A porker's head is stuffed like a sucking pig, sewed firmly, and hung on a string to roast.</p>
<p>The shoulder may be roasted, but, being very fat, it is generally preferred pickled.</p>
<p>The breast may be made into a pie, or broiled.</p>
<p>To boil <ingredient>hams,</ingredient> they should be put on in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the chill taken off, and simmered for four or five hours, taking care not to allow them to boil.</p>
<p>The prime season for pork is from November to March.</p>
<p>Take particular care it be done enough:

other meats under-done are unpleasant, but pork is absolutely uneatable; the sight of it is enough to appal the sharpest appetite, if its gravy has the least tint of redness.</p>
<p>Be careful of the crackling; if this be not crisp, or if it be burned, you will be scolded. Pickled Pork, takes more time than any other <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> If you buy your <ingredient>pork</ingredient> ready salted, ask how many days it has been in <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> if many, it will require to be soaked in <ingredient>water</ingredient> for six hours before you dress it. When you cook it, wash and scrape it as clean as possible; when delicately dressed, it is a favorite dish with almost everybody. Take care it does not boil fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces, before the thick part of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is warm through; a leg of seven pounds takes three hours and a half very slow simmering. Skim your pot very carefully, and when you take the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> out of the <implement>boiler,</implement> scrape it clean.</p>
<p>A <ingredient>leg of nice pork,</ingredient> nicely salted, and nicely boiled, is as fine a cold relish as cold ham; especially if, instead of cutting into the middle when hot, and so letting out its juices, you cut it at the knuckle: slices broiled are a good luncheon, or supper.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Mem.</emph>--Some persons who sell <ingredient>pork</ingredient> ready salted have a silly trick of cutting the knuckle in two; we suppose that this is done to save their <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> but it lets all the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> out of the leg; and unless you boil your <ingredient>pork</ingredient> merely for the sake of the pot-liquor, which in this case receives all the goodness and strength of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> friendly reader, your oracle cautions you to buy no <ingredient>leg of pork</ingredient> which is slit at the knuckle.</p>
<p>If <ingredient>pork</ingredient> is not done enough, nothing is more disagreeable; if too much, it not only loses its color and flavor, but its substance becomes soft like a <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient></p>
<p>It must never appear at table without <ingredient>parsnips;</ingredient> they are an excellent vegetable, and deserve to be much more popular; or <ingredient>carrots,</ingredient> <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> and <ingredient>greens,</ingredient> or <ingredient>mashed potatoes,</ingredient> &#38;c.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">PORK, LEG.</purpose>

Of eight pounds, will require about three hours: score the skins across in narrow stripes (some score it in diamonds), about a quarter of an inch apart; stuff the knuckle with <ingredient>sage</ingredient> and <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> minced fine, and a little <ingredient>grated bread,</ingredient> seasoned with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yolk of an egg.</ingredient></p>
<p>Do not put it too near the fire: rub a little <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> on the skin with a <implement>paste-brush,</implement> or a goose-feather: this makes the crackling crisper and browner than basting it with dripping; and it will be a better color than all the art of cookery can make it in any other way; and this is the best way of preventing the skin from blistering, which is principally occasioned by its being put too near the fire.</p>

, Usually weighs about eight or nine pounds, and will take from two to three hours to roast it thoroughly; not exactly according to its weight, but the thickness of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> upon it which varies very much. Lay the thick end nearest to the fire.</p>
<p>A proper bald spare <ingredient>rib</ingredient> of eight pounds weight (so called because almost all the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is pared off), with a steady fire, will be done in an hour and a quarter. There is so little <ingredient>meat</ingredient> on a bald spare <ingredient>rib,</ingredient> that if you have a large, fierce fire, it will be burned before it is warm through. Joint it nicely, and crack the <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> across as you do ribs of lamb.</p>
<p>When you put it down to roast, dust on some <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and baste it with a little <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> dry a dozen <ingredient>sage leaves,</ingredient> and rub them through a <implement>hair-sieve,</implement> and put them into the top of a <implement>dredging-box;</implement> and about a quarter of an hour before the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is done, baste it with <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> dust with the <ingredient>pulverized sage.</ingredient></p>

The vegetable kingdom affords no food more wholesome, more easily procured, easily prepared, or less expensive, than the <ingredient>potato:</ingredient> yet, although this most useful vegetable is dressed almost every day, in almost every family, for one plate of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> that comes to table as it should come, ten are spoiled.</p>
<p>Wash them, but do not pare or cut them, unless they are very large. Fill a saucepan half full of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> of equal size (or make them so by dividing the larger ones), put to them as much <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as will cover them about an inch: they are sooner boiled, and more <ingredient>savory,</ingredient> than when drowned in <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Most boiled things are spoiled by having too little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> but <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are often spoiled by too much: they must merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste in boiling, so that they may be just covered at the finish.</p>
<p>Set them on a moderate fire till they boil; then take them off, and put them by the side of the fire to simmer slowly till they are soft enough to admit a fork (place no dependence on the usual test of their skins' cracking, which, if they are boiled fast, will happen to some <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> when they are not half done, and the insides quite hard). Then pour the <ingredient>water</ingredient> off (if you let the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> remain in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> a moment after they are done enough, they will become waxy and watery), uncover the saucepan, and set it at such a distance from the fire as will secure it from burning; their superfluous moisture will evaporate, and the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> will be perfectly dry and mealy.</p>
<p>You may afterward place a napkin, folded up to the size of the saucepan's diameter, over the <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> to keep them hot and mealy till wanted.</p>
<p>This method of managing <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> is in every respect equal to steaming them; and they are dressed in half the time.</p>
<p>There is such an infinite variety of sorts and sizes of <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> that it is impossible to say how long they will take doing: the best way is to try them with a fork.

In choosing a turkey, the young cock bird is to be preferred; the best have black legs, and if young, the toes and bill are pliable and feel soft. A hen turkey is chosen by the same rules.</p>
<p>Fowls with black legs are the best; if fresh, the vent is close and dark; if young, the combs are bright in the color, and the legs smooth--the spurs of a young cock are short.</p>
<p>A goose, if young and fine, is plump in the breast, the fat white and soft, the feet yellow, and but few hairs upon them.</p>
<p><ingredient>Ducks</ingredient> may be chosen by the same rules, and are hard and thick on the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> and belly.</p>
<p>Pigeons should be quite fresh, the breast plump and fat, the feet elastic, and neither flabby nor discolored at the vent.</p>
<p>To prepare a turkey for dressing, every plug is carefully picked out; and in drawing turkeys and fowls, care must be taken not to break the gall bag, nor the gut which joins the gizzard, as it is impossible to remove the bitterness of the one, or the grittiness of the other. The hairs are singed off with white paper; the leg-bone is broken close to the <ingredient>foot,</ingredient> and the sinews drawn out--a cloth is then put over the <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> flattened with a rolling-pin, the <ingredient>liver</ingredient> and <ingredient>gizzard,</ingredient> made delicately clean, are fastened into each pinion.

<p>An iron plate or stove is preferable to a fire for preserving on; and by boiling the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> quickly, the form, color, and flavor, will be better preserved, and there will be less waste than in slow boiling. A round wooden stick, smaller at one end than at the other, in Scotland called a thevil, is better adapted for stirring <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> or <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> with than a silver spoon, which last is only used for skimming.

<p>A silver soup ladle is used for putting preserves into the jars, which should be of brown stone, or of white wedgewood ware.

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS.</purpose>

Great nicety is to be observed in preparing every material used for boiled or baked puddings.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> require to be well beaten, for which purpose, if many are to be done, a <implement>whisk</implement> is used; if few, a three-pronged fork. The <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is dried and sifted. The <ingredient>currants</ingredient> are carefully cleaned, by putting them into a <implement>cullender,</implement> and pouring <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> over them; if very dirty, this is to be repeated two or three times, and after being dried in a dish before the fire, they are rubbed in a clean coarse cloth, all the stalks and stones picked out, and then a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dredged over them. The <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> are stoned with a small sharp-pointed knife; it is cleansed in a basin of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which also receives the seed. The <implement>pudding cloth</implement> must be kept especially clean, or it will impart an unpleasant taste to anything that is boiled in it; and when taken off a pudding, it ought immediately to be laid in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and afterwards well washed with soda or pearl-ashes in <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient> Just before being used for a rice, bread, or batter pudding, it should be dipped into <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> wrung, shaken, and well dredged with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> and for a plum, <ingredient>suet pudding,</ingredient> or any sort of <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> pudding in <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> it must be buttered before being floured.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should boil quick when the pudding is put in; and it should be moved about for a minute, for fear the ingredients should not mix.</p>
<p>When the pudding is done, a pan of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> should be ready, and the pudding dipped into it as soon as it comes out of the pot, which will prevent its adhering to the cloth.</p>
<p>A bread pudding should be tied loose; if batter, it must be tied tight over, and a batter pudding should be strained through a coarse sieve when all is mixed. In others, the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> only. If you boil the pudding in a basin or pan, take care that it is always well buttered.</p>
<p>When you make your puddings without eggs, they must have as little <ingredient>milk</ingredient> as will mix, and must boil for three or four hours. A few spoonfuls of small <ingredient>beer,</ingredient> or one of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> is the best substitute for <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Your puddings will always be much lighter if you beat the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and <ingredient>whites of the eggs</ingredient> long and separately. You may, if you please, use snow instead of eggs, either in puddings or pancakes. Two large spoonfuls will supply the place of one <ingredient>egg;</ingredient> the snow may be taken up from any clean spot before it is wanted, and will not lose its virtue, though the sooner it is used the better.</p>
<p>All puddings in <ingredient>paste</ingredient> are tied tightly, but other puddings loosely, in the cloth. When a pudding is to be boiled in a shape, a piece of buttered white paper is put upon the top of it, before the floured cloth is tied on. The pan, dish, or shape, in which the pudding is to be either boiled or baked, must always be buttered before it is filled. It is an improvement to puddings in general to let them stand some time after being prepared either for boiling or baking. When a pudding 
 
<pb n="156" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=198"/>

is to be boiled, it must be put on in a covered pot, in plenty of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and never for a moment be allowed to be off the boil until ready to be served. As the <ingredient>water</ingredient> wastes, more, and always boiling, must be added. A plum pudding is the better for being mixed the day before it is to be boiled. It may be useful to observe that this pudding will keep for months after it is dressed, if the cloth be allowed to remain upon it, and if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet of <implement>foolscap paper,</implement> and then hung up in a cool place. When about to be used, it must be put into a clean cloth, and again boiled for an hour; or it may be cut into slices, and broiled as wanted. If in breaking <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> a bad one should accidentally drop into the basin amongst the rest, the whole will be spoiled; and therefore they should be broken one by one into a <implement>tea-cup.</implement> When the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> only of <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are required for a <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> or other things, the <ingredient>yolks,</ingredient> if not broken, will keep good for three days, if the basin they are in be covered.</p>
<p>A slab of marble, stone, or slate, is preferable to wood for rolling out <ingredient>paste</ingredient> on. The rolling-pin, cutters, and every other implement used in these processes, must be kept particularly clean; they should always be washed immediately after being used, and then well dried. Before using <ingredient>butter</ingredient> for <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> it is laid for some time into <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> which is changed once or twice. When <ingredient>salt butter</ingredient> is used, it is well worked in two or three waters. If it should not be convenient to make the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> immediately before it is baked, it will not suffer from standing, if made early in the morning, and the air excluded from it, by putting first a tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and above that a folded table-cloth. To ascertain if the oven be of a proper heat, a little bit of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> may be baked in it, before any thing else be put in. <ingredient>Puff paste</ingredient> requires rather a brisk oven. If too hot it binds the surface and prevents the steam from rising, and if too slow it becomes sodden and flat. Raised crusts require a quick oven; puffs and tartlets, which are filled with <ingredient>preserved fruit,</ingredient> are sufficiently done when the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is baked. When large pies have been in the oven for a few minutes, a paper is put over them to prevent their being burned.</p>

Put it into an earthen <implement>pudding mould,</implement> that is well buttered. Tie a cloth over it very tight; put it into boiling <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and boil it three hours.

<p>Don't let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> cease to boil: it will spoil the pudding. And it is always best that puddings be mixed an hour or two before put into the pot, the ingredients get amalgamated, and the whole becomes richer and fuller of flavor.</p>
<p>The above pudding may be baked in an oven, or under <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> as Yorkshire pudding, only add half pint more <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Should it be above an inch and quarter in thickness, it will take full two hours; and requires careful watching; for if the top gets burned, a bad flavor will pervade the whole pudding.

The goodness of this preparation depends almost entirely on having fine <ingredient>mellow fish,</ingredient> that have been in pickle long enough (<emph rend="italic">i.e. about twelve months)</emph> to dissolve easily, yet are not at all rusty.</p>
<p>Choose those that are in the state they come over in, not such as have been put into fresh pickle, mixed with red paint, which some add to improve the complexion of the <ingredient>fish;</ingredient> it has been said, that others have a trick of putting <ingredient>anchovy liquor</ingredient> on pickled sprats; you will easily discover this by washing one of them, and tasting the flesh of it, which in the fine <ingredient>anchovy</ingredient> is mellow, red, and high-flavored, and the bone moist and oily. Make only as much as will soon be used, the fresher it is the better.</p>
<p>Put ten or twelve <ingredient>anchovies</ingredient> into a <implement>mortar,</implement> and pound them to a pulp; put this into a very clean iron, or silver, or very well tinned saucepan; then put a large table-spoonful of <ingredient>cold spring-water</ingredient> (we prefer good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient>) into the <implement>mortar;</implement> shake it round, and pour it to the pounded <ingredient>anchovies,</ingredient>

set them by the side of a slow fire, very frequently stirring them together till they are melted, which they will be in the course of five minutes. Now stir in a quarter of a drachm of good <ingredient>cayenne pepper,</ingredient> and let it remain by the side of the fire for a few minutes longer; then, while it is warm, rub it through a <implement>hair sieve,</implement> with the back of a wooden spoon.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>essence of anchovy,</ingredient> is made with double the above quantity of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> as they are of opinion that it ought to be so thin as not to hang about the sides of the bottle; when it does, the large surface of it is soon acted upon by the air, and becomes rancid and spoils all the rest of it.</p>
<p>A roll of thin-cut <ingredient>lemon-peel</ingredient> infused with the <ingredient>anchovy,</ingredient> imparts a fine, fresh, delicate, aromatic flavor, which is very grateful; this is only recommended when you make <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> for immediate use; it will keep much better without: if you wish to acidulute it, instead of <ingredient>water</ingredient> make it with artificial <ingredient>lemon-juice.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">RICE CASSEROLE.</purpose>

Take a pound and a half of <ingredient>rice,</ingredient> wash it thoroughly in several <ingredient>waters</ingredient> (warm), and then put it into a saucepan, at least eight inches in diameter; moisten it with stock, in this proportion; if the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> lies an inch thick, let the stock come two inches above it, and four ladlefuls of <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> skimmings; place the saucepan on a hot stove; when the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> boils, set it on the side, and skim it; then put it on hot ashes, cover, and let it boil slowly for fifteen to twenty minutes; stir it, let it boil as before; in twenty or twenty-five minutes, stir it again; if by this time the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> is perfectly soft, take it off, but if not, add a little more liquid, and continue boiling until it is so; place the saucepan aslant on the side of the stove that the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> may drain away and be taken off easily. As soon as the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> is lukewarm, work it into a firm, smooth, <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> with a <implement>spatula;</implement> it can hardly be worked up too much, as every grain of <ingredient>rice</ingredient> ought to pass under pressure (if necessary, add more stock, a very little at a time). When the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is thus thoroughly worked up, form your <emph rend="italic">casserole</emph> of it, first laying it in a heap, four or five inches high, and seven in diameter; do it with the hand as you would a raised crust; make the ornaments of the outer surface with the point of a knife, or by <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> cut for the purpose, taking care that the decorations be detached from the mass of <ingredient>rice,</ingredient> at least an inch; attention to this particular will not only add to the beauty of the form, but to the color also, as the raised parts will be lightly colored, while the ground will be quite white. When properly formed, mask the whole surface with <ingredient>clarified butter,</ingredient> and place it in a hot oven for an hour and a half, by which time it will be of a fine clear yellow. Take off the top of your <emph rend="italic">casserole</emph>, clear away all the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> from the inside that does not adhere to the crust (which ought to be very thin), and mix it with <emph rend="italic">bechamelle, espangnole,</emph> or whatever other <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> may be proper, put it in again, and then fill your <emph rend="italic">casserole,</emph> with such ragouts as your fancy may dictate; glaze the surface of the outer ornaments, and serve it. <ingredient>Water,</ingredient> with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> is frequently thought preferable to the stock, &#38;c., as the <ingredient>rice</ingredient> is thereby rendered much whiter.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">SALTING MEAT.</purpose>

In the <emph rend="italic">summer</emph> season, especially, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is frequently spoiled by the cook forgetting to take out the kernels; one in the <ingredient>udder</ingredient> of a <ingredient>round of beef,</ingredient> in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in the middle of the round, those about the thick end of the flank, &#38;c.: if these are not taken out, all the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in the world will not keep the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
<p>The art of salting <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is to rub in the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> thoroughly and evenly into every part, and to fill all the holes full of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> where the kernels were taken out, and where the butcher's <implement>skewers</implement> were.</p>
<p>A <ingredient>round of beef</ingredient> of 25 pounds will take a pound and a half of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to be rubbed in all at first, and requires to be turned and rubbed every day with the <ingredient>brine;</ingredient> it will be ready for dressing in four or five days, if you do not wish it very <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>
<p>In <emph rend="italic">summer</emph>, the sooner <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is salted after it is killed, the better; and care must be taken to defend it from the flies.</p>
<p>In <emph rend="italic">winter</emph>, it will eat the shorter and tenderer, if kept a few days (according to the temperature of the weather) until its fibre has become short and tender, as these changes do not take place after it has been acted upon by the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>
<p>In frosty weather, take care the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is not frozen, and warm the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in a frying-pan. The extremes of heat and cold are equally unfavorable for the process of salting. In the former, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> changes before the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> can affect it: in the latter, it is so hardened, and its <ingredient>juices</ingredient> are so congealed, that the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> cannot penetrate it.</p>
<p>If you wish it red, rub it first with <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> in the proportion of half an ounce, and the like quantity of <ingredient>moist sugar,</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>common salt.</ingredient></p>
<p>You may impregnate <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with a very agreeable vegetable flavor, by pounding some <ingredient>sweet herbs,</ingredient> and an <ingredient>onion</ingredient> with the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> You may make it still more relishing by adding a little <ingredient>ZEST</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic"><ingredient>savory spice</ingredient></emph>.</p>

The secret of frying <ingredient>sausages</ingredient> is, to let them get hot very gradually; they then will not burst, if they are not stale.

<p>Prepare some <ingredient>bread-crumbs,</ingredient> by rubbing some <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> through a <implement>colander;</implement> or, if you wish the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> to appear very delicate

and highly finished, through a <implement>hair sieve;</implement> or use <ingredient>biscuit powder.</ingredient></p>
<p>Beat the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> and <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> well together, on a plate, with a fork; <ingredient>flour</ingredient> your <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> to absorb any moisture that may remain, and wipe it off with a clean cloth; dip them in the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> on both sides all over, or, what is better, <ingredient>egg</ingredient> them with a <implement>paste-brush;</implement> put the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> on in an even degree over the whole <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> or the <ingredient>bread crumbs</ingredient> will not stick to it even, and the uneven part will burn to the pan. Strew the <ingredient>bread crumbs</ingredient> all over the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> so that they cover every part, take up the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> by the head, and shake off the loose crumbs. The <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is now ready for the frying-pan, into which put a quart or more of fresh <ingredient>sweet olive oil,</ingredient> or <ingredient>clarified butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>dripping,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> or <ingredient>clarified drippings;</ingredient> be sure that they are quite sweet and perfectly clean (the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> ought to cover the <ingredient>fish</ingredient>): what we here order is for <ingredient>soles</ingredient> about ten inches long; if larger, cut them into pieces the proper size to help at table; this will save much time and trouble to the carver: when you send them to table, lay them in the same form they were before they were cut, and you may strew a little <ingredient>curled parsley</ingredient> over them: they are much easier managed in the frying-pan, and require less <ingredient>fat</ingredient>: fry the thick part a few minutes before you put in the thin, you can by this means only fry the thick part enough, without frying the thin too much. Very large <ingredient>soles</ingredient> should be boiled, or fried in fillets. <ingredient>Soles</ingredient> cut in pieces, crossways, about the size of a <ingredient>smelt,</ingredient> make a very pretty garnish for stewed <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and boiled <ingredient>fish.</ingredient></p>
<p>Set the frying-pan over a sharp and clear fire; watch it, skim it with an <implement>egg-slice,</implement> and when it boils, <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> when it has done bubbling, and the smoke just begins to rise from the surface, put in the <ingredient>fish</ingredient>: if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is not extremely hot, it is impossible to fry <ingredient>fish</ingredient> of a good color, or to keep them firm and crisp.</p>
<p>The best way to ascertain the heat of the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> is to try it with a bit of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> as big as a <ingredient>nut;</ingredient> if it is quite hot enough, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will brown immediately. Put in the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> and it will be crisp and brown on the side next the fire, in about four or five minutes; to turn it, stick a two-pronged fork near the <ingredient>head,</ingredient> and support the tail with a <implement>fish slice,</implement> and fry the other side nearly the same length of time. Fry one <ingredient>sole</ingredient> at a time, except the pan is very large, and you have plenty of <ingredient>fat.</ingredient></p>
<p>When the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are fried, lay them on a soft cloth (old table-cloths are best), near enough the fire to keep them warm; turn them every two or three minutes, till they are quite dry on both sides; this common cooks commonly neglect. It will take ten or fifteen minutes, if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> you fried them in was not hot enough; when it is, they want very little drying. When <ingredient>soles</ingredient> are fried, they will keep very good in a dry place for three or four days; warm them by hanging them on the hooks in a <implement>Dutch oven,</implement> letting them heat very gradually, by putting it some distance from the fire for about twenty minutes, or in good <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> as <ingredient>eels,</ingredient> Wiggy's way.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Obs</emph>.--There are several general rules in this receipt which apply to all fried <ingredient>fish</ingredient>: we have been very particular and minute in our directions; for, although a fried <ingredient>sole</ingredient> is so frequent and favorite a dish, it is very seldom brought to table in perfection.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">SOUPS.</purpose>

Every utensil employed in a kitchen must be kept scrupulously clean, and a cook ought to take especial care that all her saucepans be in good order. Brass pans are preferable for preserving in, and double block tin are the best sort in use for every other purpose; their covers, should be made to fit closely, and the tinning always renewed as soon as it is observed to be wearing off. While new, they may be easily kept clean by washing them regularly in hot water, and rubbing on them when quite dry, a little whiting with leather or <implement>flannel.</implement> After long use, they will require occasional scouring with fine sand; and before they are used, they ought always to be rinsed out with hot water, and wiped with a clean cloth. A landlady will find it good economy, and for her advantage in other respects, to provide plenty of <implement>stone ware</implement> and earthen vessels, and also common dishes for the kitchen, that the table set may not be used to keep cold meat on.</p>
<p>In boiling soup, less <ingredient>water</ingredient> is used in a <implement>digester</implement> than in a common pot, as in a <implement>digester</implement> no steam can escape.</p>
<p>To extract the strength from <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> long and slow boiling is necessary, but care must be taken that the pot is never off the boil. All soups are better for being made the day before they are to be used, and they should then be strained into earthen pans. When soup has jellied in the pan, it should not be removed into another, as breaking it will occasion its becoming sour sooner than it would otherwise do; when in danger of not keeping, it should be boiled up. It never keeps long with many vegetables in it. The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> used for soups or broths cannot be too fresh. When any animal food is plain boiled, the liquor, with the addition of the trimmings of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>poultry,</ingredient> make good soups and <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> as do also the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> of

<ingredient>roasted or broiled meat.</ingredient> The <ingredient>gravies</ingredient> left in the dishes answer for hashes, and the liquor in which <ingredient>veal</ingredient> has been boiled, may be made into a glaze by boiling it with a <ingredient>ham bone</ingredient> till reduced to a third or fourth part, and <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> it with the necessary <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> and <ingredient>spices.</ingredient></p>
<p>In boiling weak soups, the pan should be uncovered that the watery particles may escape. <ingredient>Cow-heel jelly</ingredient> improves every sort of rich soup; and for thickening, <ingredient>truffles,</ingredient> <ingredient>morels,</ingredient> and <ingredient>dried mushrooms,</ingredient> may be used with advantage.</p>
<p>Directions are given with each of the following soups for thickening with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> after the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are added, the soup must not be allowed to boil.</p>
<p>Should brown gravy or mock turtle soup be spoiling, fresh-made <ingredient>charcoal,</ingredient> roughly pounded, tied in a little bag and boiled with either, will absorb the bad flavor and leave it sweet and good.

<p>A <ingredient>head</ingredient> weighing twenty pounds, and ten pounds of stock <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> will make ten quarts of excellent soup, besides the two quarts of stock you have put by for made dishes.</p>

<p>N.

<p><purpose rend="bold" placement="inline">THICKENEING.</purpose>

<ingredient>Clarified butter</ingredient> is best for this purpose; but if you have none ready, put some fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into a <implement>stewpan</implement> over a slow, clear fire; when it is melted, add <ingredient>fine flour</ingredient> sufficient to make it the thickness of <ingredient>paste;</ingredient> stir it well together with a wooden spoon for fifteen or twenty minutes, till it is quite smooth, and the color of a guinea: this must be done very gradually and patiently; if you put it over too fierce a fire to hurry it, it will become bitter and empyreumatic: pour it into an earthen pan, and keep it for use. It will keep good a fortnight in summer, and longer in winter.</p>
<p>A large spoonful will generally be enough to thicken a quart of <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient></p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Obs</emph>.--This, in the French kitchen, is called <emph rend="italic">roux</emph>. Be particularly attentive in making it; if it gets any burnt smell or taste, it will spoil every thing it is put into. When cold, it should be thick enough to cut out with a knife, like a solid paste.</p>
<p>It is a very essential article in the kitchen, and is the basis of consistency in most made-dishes, soups, sauces, and ragouts; if the gravies, &#38;c. are too thin, add this thickening, more or less, according to the consistence you would wish them to have.</p>
<p>MEM.--In making thickening, the less <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and the more <ingredient>flour</ingredient> you use, the better; they must be thoroughly worked together, and the broth, or soup, &#38;c. you put them to, added by degrees: take especial care to incorporate them well together, or your sauces, &#38;c. will taste floury, and have a disgusting, greasy appearance: therefore, after you have thickened your sauce, add to it some <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> or warm <ingredient>water,</ingredient> in the proportion of two table-spoonfuls to a pint, and set it by the side of the fire, to raise any <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> &#38;c. that is not thoroughly incorporated with the <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> which you must carefully remove as it comes to the top. This is called cleansing, or finishing the <ingredient>sauce.</ingredient></p>
<p>Half an ounce of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> are about the proportion for a pint of <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> to make it as thick as <ingredient>cream.</ingredient></p>
<p>N. B.--The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> skimmings off the top of the broth-pot are sometimes substituted for <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> some cooks merely thicken their soups and sauces with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>

This excellent <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is in season the greatest part of the summer; when good, it is at once firm and tender, and abounds with rich gelatinous nutriment.</p>

<p>An hour or two before you dress it, soak it in <ingredient>spring water</ingredient> with some <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in it, then score the skin across the thickest part of the back, to prevent its breaking on the <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> which will happen from the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> swelling, and cracking the skin, if this precaution be not used.

A fowl and a turkey require the same management at the fire, only the latter will take longer time.</p>

<p>Let them be carefully picked, c. and break the breast bone (to make them look plump), twist up a sheet of clean writing paper, light it, and thoroughly singe the turkey all over, turning it about over the flame.</p>
<p>Turkeys, fowls, and capons have a much better appearance, if, instead of trussing them with the legs close together, and the feet cut off, the legs are extended on each side of the bird, and the toes only cut off, with a <implement>skewer</implement> through each foot, to keep them at a proper distance.</p>
<p>Be careful, when you draw it, to preserve the liver, and not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will take off the bitter taste it gives, where it once touches.</p>
<p>Prepare a nice, clear, brisk fire for it.</p>

The names of the joints are as follows: Loin, best end--Loin, chump end--Fillet--Hind Hnuckle--Neck, best end--Neck, scrag end--Blade bone--Breast, best end--Brisket end.</p>
<p>Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, white, and fat,and the leg bone small. The finest calves have the smallest kidney, and its being well covered with thick white fat, indicates good veal. The fillet of a cow calf is to be preferred, on account of the udder. The prime joints are the fillet, the loin, the 
 
<pb n="230" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=272"/>

chump end of the loin, and the best end of the neck. To keep it, the same directions may be followed, which are given for keeping beef.</p>
<p>When the fillet is to be roasted, it should be washed, well dried, and the bone taken out, and the space filled with a fine <ingredient>stuffing,</ingredient>part of which should be put under the flap, then formed into a round and firmly skewered. That the fire may be clean and strong, it should be made up sometime before putting down the roast, which should at first be placed at some distance from it, and be frequently and well basted with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> When about half roasted, a piece of white paper is tied over the fat; a little before serving, it is removed, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is then sprinkled with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> dredged with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and well basted to froth it. When dished, finely <ingredient>melted butter</ingredient> is poured over it, with which may or may not be mixed some <ingredient>lemon pickle</ingredient> or <ingredient>brown gravy.</ingredient> It is garnished with cut <ingredient>lemon.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Veal</ingredient> is expected to come to table looking delicately clean; and it is so easily discolored, that you must be careful to have clean <ingredient>water,</ingredient> a clean vessel, and constantly catch the scum as soon and as long as it rises. Send up <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> <ingredient>fried sausages,</ingredient> or <ingredient>pickled pork,</ingredient> <ingredient>greens,</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> and <ingredient>batter,</ingredient> and <ingredient>onion sauce.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Veal</ingredient> requires particular care to roast it a nice brown. Let the fire be the same as for <ingredient>beef;</ingredient> a sound large fire for a large joint, and a brisker for a smaller; put it at some distance from the fire to soak thoroughly, and then draw it near to finish it brown.</p>
<p>When first laid down it is to be basted; baste it again occasionally. When the <ingredient>veal</ingredient> is on the dish, pour over it half a pint of <ingredient>melted butter</ingredient>: if you have a little <ingredient>brown gravy</ingredient> by you, add that to the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> With those joints which are not stuffed, send up <ingredient>forcemeat</ingredient> in balls, or rolled into <ingredient>sausages,</ingredient> as garnish to the dish, or <ingredient>fried pork sausages;</ingredient> <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> and <ingredient>greens,</ingredient> are also always expected with <ingredient>boiled veal.</ingredient></p>
<p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Fillet of Veal</ingredient></emph>, Of from twelve to sixteen pounds, will require from four to five hours at a good fire; make some <ingredient>stuffing</ingredient> or <ingredient>forcemeat,</ingredient> and put it in under the flap, that there may be some left to eat cold, or to season a hash; brown it, and pour good <ingredient>melted butter</ingredient> over it.</p>
<p>Garnish with thin slices of <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> and cakes or balls of <ingredient>stuffing,</ingredient> or <ingredient>duck stuffing,</ingredient> or fried <ingredient>pork sausages,</ingredient> <ingredient>curry sauce,</ingredient> <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> and <ingredient>greens,</ingredient> &#38;c.</p>
<p>A bit of the brown outside is a favorite with the epicure in roasts. The <ingredient>kidney,</ingredient> cut out, sliced, and broiled, is a high relish, which some <emph rend="italic">bons vivants</emph> are fond of.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">A <ingredient>Loin</ingredient></emph>, Is the best part of the <ingredient>calf,</ingredient> and will take about three hours roasting. Paper the kidney fat, and the back: some cooks send it up on a toast, which is eaten with the <ingredient>kidney</ingredient> and the fat of this part, which is as delicate as any marrow. If there is more of it than you think will be eaten with the <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> before you roast it cut it out; it will make an excellent suet pudding; take care to have your fire long enough to brown the ends; same accompaniments as above.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">A <ingredient>Shoulder</ingredient></emph>, From three hours to three hours and a half; stuff it with the <ingredient>forcemeat</ingredient> ordered for the <ingredient>fillet of veal,</ingredient> in the under side.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Neck,</ingredient> best end</emph>, Will take two hours; same accompaniments as fillet. The scrag part is the best made into a pie, or broth.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Breast</ingredient></emph>, From an hour and a half to two hours. Let the caul remain till it is almost done, then take it off to brown it; baste, flour, and froth it.</p>
<p>This makes a <ingredient>savory</ingredient> relish for a luncheon or supper: or, instead of roasting, boil it enough; put it in a cloth between two <implement>pewter dishes,</implement> with a weight on the upper one, and let it remain so till cold; then pare and trim, <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and crumb it, and broil, or warm it in a <implement>Dutch oven;</implement> serve with it <ingredient>capers,</ingredient> or <ingredient>wow wow sauce.</ingredient> <ingredient>Breast of mutton</ingredient> may be dressed the same way.</p>

There is nothing in which the difference between an elegant and an ordinary table is more seen than in the dressing of vegetables, more especially greens. They may be equally as fine at first, at one place as at another; but their look and taste are afterward very different, entirely from the careless way in which they have been cooked.</p>
<p>They are in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty, <emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> when in full season.</p>
<p>By season, I do not mean those early days, that luxury in the buyers, and avarice in the sellers, force the vegetables; but that time of the year in which by nature and common culture, and the mere operation of the sun and climate, they are in most plenty and perfection.</p>
<p>As to the quality of vegetables, the middle size are preferred to the largest or the smallest; they are more tender, juicy, and full of flavor, just before they are quite full-grown. Freshness is their chief value and excellence, and I should as soon think of roasting an animal alive, as of boiling a vegetable after it is dead.</p>
<p>The eye easily discovers if they have been kept too long; they soon lose their beauty in all respects.</p>
<p>Roots, greens, salads, &#38;c. and the various productions of the garden, when first gathered, are plump and firm, and have a fragrant freshness no art can give them again, when they have lost it by long keeping; though it will refresh them a little to put them into cold spring water for sometime before they are dressed.</p>
<p>To boil them in soft water will preserve the color best of such as are green; if you have only hard water, put to it a tea-spoonful of <emph rend="italic">carbonate of potash</emph>.</p>
<p>Take care to wash and cleanse them thoroughly from dust, dirt, and insects: this requires great attention. Pick off all the outside leaves, trim them nicely, and, if not quite fresh gathered and have become flaccid, 
 
<pb n="237" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=279"/>

it is absolutely necessary to restore their crispness before cooking them, or they will be tough and unpleasant: lay them in a pan of clean water, with a handful of salt in it, for an hour before you dress them.</p>
<p>They should always be boiled in a saucepan by themselves, and have plenty of water; if meat is boiled with them in the same pot, they will spoil the look and taste of each other.</p>
<p>If you wish to have vegetables delicately clean, put on your pot, make it boil, put a little salt in it, and skim it perfectly clean before you put in the greens, &#38;c.; which should not be put in till the water boils briskly: the quicker they boil, the greener they will be. When the vegetables sink, they are generally done enough, if the water has been kept constantly boiling. Take them up immediately, or they will lose their color and goodness. Drain the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from them thoroughly before you send them to table.</p>
<p>This branch of cookery requires the most vigilant attention.</p>
<p>If vegetables are a minute or two too long over the fire, they lose all their beauty and flavor.</p>
<p>If not thoroughly boiled tender, they are tremendously indigestible, and much more troublesome during their residence in the stomach, than under-done meats.</p>
<p>Once for all, take care your vegetables are fresh: for as the fishmonger often suffers for the sins of the cook, so the cook often gets undeservedly blamed instead of the green-grocer.</p>
<p>Strong scented vegetables should be kept apart; leeks, or celery, laid among cauliflowers, &#38;c. will quickly spoil them.</p>
<p>Succulent vegetables are best preserved in a cool, shady, and damp place.</p>
<p>Potatoes, turnips, carrots, and similar roots, intended to be stored up, should never be cleaned from the earth adhering to them, till they are to be dressed.</p>
<p>They must be protected from the action of the air and frost, by laying them in heaps, burying them in sand or earth, &#38;c., or covering them with straw or mats.</p>
<p>When vegetables are quite fresh gathered, they will not require so much boiling, by at least a third of the time, as when they have been gathered the usual time of those that are brought to public markets.</p>
<p>Vegetables are always best when newly gathered, and should be brought in from the garden early in the morning; they will then have a fragrant freshness, which they lose by keeping.</p>
<p>They must be cleaned with the greatest care, the outside leaves of every description of greens removed, and they, and all other vegetables, more particularly when not recently gathered, should be laid for several hours in cold water, and well shaken to throw out the insects. A tea-spoonful of salt should always be put into the water in which they are to be boiled, and if it is hard, a tea-spoonful of salt of tartar, or potash, may be added to preserve the green color of the vegetables.</p>
<p>All vegetables should be boiled quickly, and, with the exception of spinach, in an open vessel, skimming them carefully.</p>
<p>Kitchen greens should be kept in a cool and shady place. Potatoes, carrots, turnips, and beet root should be stored up, without being cleaned from the earth adhering to them, in layers of sand, or laid in heaps, and covered with earth and straw. Parsnips and skirrets not being injured by frost, are generally left in the ground, and taken up as wanted. Onions are stored in a warm, dry place, never in a cellar; they are sometimes strung in bunches, and suspended from the roof, and, more effectually to prevent their growing, some people select the finest bulbs, and singe the roots with a hot iron.</p>
<p>Herbs of all sorts should be gathered when in flower, and on a dry day, and being well cleaned from dust and dirt, they are tied up in small bunches, and dried before the fire in a <implement>Dutch oven.</implement> They may then be kept in paper bags labelled; or rubbed to a powder, sifted, and put into bottles.</p>

The next operation is this: the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is poured into large vessels, called rapetuns, to which there are false bottoms covered with rape, that is, the refuse of <ingredient>raisins,</ingredient> or other <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> from which <ingredient>wine</ingredient> has been made; fill one of these tuns entirely with 
 
<pb n="240" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=coow&#38;PageNum=282"/>

the <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and another about three-fourths full, and every day take a portion of the liquor out of the fullest barrel, and put it into the other, until the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is in a fit state to be drawn off; when it must be closely barrelled.</p>
<p><ingredient>Vinegar</ingredient> may also be made in much smaller quantities for domestic purposes; the materials of various kinds, with the addition of <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> <ingredient>raisins,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> and ripe <ingredient>gooseberries,</ingredient> however, are the principal; sometimes it is made from <ingredient>brown sugar,</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> alone. The proportions are the same as those necessary for strong <ingredient>wine;</ingredient> make the barrel about three-fourths full, add a toast covered with <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> put in the bung very loosely, and place the barrel where it will be exposed to the sun, or, if it be winter, near the fire. The fermentation should be moderate and constant till the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is complete; then draw it off clear, give it a boil, and when quite cold, strain and bottle it.</p>
<p><ingredient>Vinegar</ingredient> is obtained from <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> by mixing with the latter its own flowers, or ferment, and its tartar reduced to powder, and put into a <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> or any other <implement>cask;</implement> if the latter, it must be placed in a warm situation, full of the steam from <ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> in either case the liquor should be stirred frequently; the second fermentation will speedily commence; it will become heated, and turn acid by degrees, and in a short time the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> will be produced.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that <ingredient>wine</ingredient> which has become acid, will produce excellent <ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> this, however, is a mistaken idea, for the stronger and better the quality of the <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> the stronger and better will be the <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient></p>
<p>The French have several methods of making <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> which are subjoined.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> makers of Orleans pour the <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> of which they intend to make their <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> into <implement>casks,</implement> at the bottoms of which are close gratings of <ingredient>lime</ingredient> twigs; these serve to clarify the <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> as the lees adhering to the twigs, leave the liquor perfectly clear. They then procure a number of <implement>casks,</implement> each containing a hundred gallons, either new or which have previously contained <ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> these are set upright, and in the top of every one is bored a hole, two inches in diameter, these are kept constantly open: the last mentioned <implement>casks</implement> are called <emph rend="italic">Mothers;</emph> pour into all of them twenty-five gallons of boiling <ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> to this, in a week's time, add three gallons of <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> drawn from the first mentioned <implement>casks;</implement> continue to add the <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> at intervals of a week, until the <emph rend="italic">Mothers</emph> are quite full; then leave them for a fortnight, and at the end of which period they generally draw off the <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> taking care always to leave the <emph rend="italic">Mothers</emph> half full, at least, and then to fill them with <ingredient>wine</ingredient> as before. The method of proving when the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is fit for use, is, by plunging a stave into it; if on taking it out, a <ingredient>white</ingredient> line is perceptible on the end of it, the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is quite ready. The place where the <implement>casks</implement> are kept should be very airy, and in the winter time, by means of stoves the temperature should be raised to eighteen degrees of Reaumur.</p>
<p>Paris vinegar varies from the above, and the process is very simple. A large quantity of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> lees is put into coarse sacks,and laid in tubs, which are placed one upon another to form a kind of press; by means of a screw, every drop of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is gradually squeezed from the lees; this operation cannot be performed in less time than a week. The <ingredient>wine</ingredient> thus extracted is put into <implement>casks;</implement> in the headings a hold is made, as above, which holes are left constantly open; in summer time the <implement>casks</implement> so filled are placed in the sun, and, generally speaking, the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is fit for use in a fortnight. In the winter, the fermentation will last double the time, and must be assisted by artificial warmth. It sometimes happens that the liquor heats to so great a degree that the hand cannot be borne in it; in this case, the progress of the fermentation must be checked by adding more <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> until it proceeds more regularly. When the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> is made, put it into <implement>casks,</implement> which have the beech twigs at the bottom, as above mentioned; let it remain a fortnight, by which time it will be sufficiently fermented to draw off into the <implement>casks</implement> for keeping it.</p>
<p>Another very simple method is also practiced in France; a few quarts are drawn from a barrel of excellent <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and an equal quantity of very clear <ingredient>white wine</ingredient> is put into the barrel, close the bung lightly, and keep it in a place where the heat is moderate and regular. In a month's time draw off the same quantity as above, and pour in an equal portion of <ingredient>white wine.</ingredient> A barrel of good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> will thus afford a constant supply for a length of time without leaving the slightest deposit.</p>
<p>A <implement>cask</implement> which has not contained <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> before, should have a quart of boiling hot <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> poured into it, shaken till cold, and allowed to stand for some hours.</p>

To make these articles, it is necessary to have a small copper <implement>stewpan</implement> that will hold about a pint, rather deep than wide, with a pointed lip on the right side, and a tolerably long handle, also two pieces of wood, one about eighteen inches long, and four in diameter, called the <emph rend="italic">bois a tabeller,</emph> the other about half the length, one inch in diameter, and the lower end, pointed so that it will exactly fit the lip of the pan; this is called the <emph rend="italic">bois a egoutter;</emph> six or eight tin plates about the size of a sheet of letter-paper.</p>
<p>For the best <emph rend="italic">pastilles,</emph> take a pound of <ingredient>double-refined sugar</ingredient> reduced to an impalpable powder; sift it through a <implement>tammy</implement> on a sheet of white paper, put four or five spoonfuls of this <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> into your pan, pour on it a little <ingredient>orange-flower water,</ingredient> and beat it well with the larger stick, until the preparation is sufficiently thin to run from the stick without being clear; if it be so, more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> must be added.

<emph rend="italic">Different Degrees of Preparing.</emph> The various purposes to which sugar is applied, require it to be in different states; these are called <emph rend="italic">degrees,</emph> and are thirteen in number, called as follows:</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Petit Lisse,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">First Degree</emph> Replace the <ingredient>clarified sugar</ingredient> in the <implement>preserving-pan,</implement> to boil gently, take a drop of it on the thumb, touch it with the fore-finger; if, on opening them, it draws to a fine thread, and in breaking, forms two drops on each finger, it is at the right point.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Lisse, Second Degree.</emph> A litte more boiling brings it to this point; when the thread will draw further before it breaks.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Petit Perle, Third Degree</emph>. At this point the thread may be drawn as far as the span will open, without breaking.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Grand Perle, Fourth Degree.</emph> On still increasing the boiling, little raised balls are formed on the surface of the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient></p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Petit Queue de Cochon, Fifth Degree.</emph> Take up some of the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> on a <implement>skimmer,</implement> and drop it on the rest, when it should form a slanting streak on the surface. Boil it a little longer, and it will reach the</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Grand Queue de Cochon, </emph> or<emph rend="italic">Sixth Degree.</emph> The streak or tail is now larger.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Souffle, Seveth Degree.</emph> Take out a skimmerful of the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> blow through it, and small sparks of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> will fly from it.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Petit-Plume, Eighth Degree.</emph> The same proof as above; the sparks should be larger and stronger.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Grande Plume, Ninth Degree.</emph> Take the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> in the <implement>skimmer,</implement> as before, give it a shake, and if the sparks are large, and adhere together on rising, it is at the right point.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Petit Boulet, Tenth Degree.</emph> Dip your fingers in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and then into the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> instantly, and again into the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> when the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> will roll into a ball, which will be supple when cold.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Gros Boulet, Eleventh Degree.</emph> At this point, the ball or bullet will be harder when cold than at the last.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Casse, Twelfth Degree.</emph> Prove as above; the bullet should crumble between the fingers, and on biting, will stick to the teeth; at the next point,</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Caramel, Thirteenth Degree,</emph> It should snap clean. This point is very difficult to attain, for in increasing the height, the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is apt to burn; it is better therefore to try the proof very frequently.</p>
<p>Another caramel is frequently used by the confectioner, and is of a deep color; it is made by putting a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> to the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and boiling it without skimming, or otherwise touching the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> till of the right color, then take it off and use immediately.</p>
<p>If, on preparing the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> you happen to miss the right point, add a little <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and boil once more.</p>
