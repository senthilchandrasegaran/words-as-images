<hd align="center">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>THE success of her little book entitled "Seventy-five Receipts in Cakes, Pastry, and Sweetmeats." has encouraged the author to attempt a larger and more miscellaneous work on the subject of cookery, comprising as far as practicable whatever is most useful in its various departments; and particularly adapted to the domestic economy of her own country. Designing it as a manual of American housewifery, she has avoided the insertion of any dishes whose ingredients cannot be procured on our side of the Atlantic, and which require for their preparation utensils that are rarely found except in Europe. Also, she has omitted every thing which may not, by the generality of tastes, be considered good of its kind, and well worth the trouble and cost of preparing.</p><p>The author has spared no pains in collecting and arranging, perhaps the greatest number of practical and original receipts that have ever appeared in a similar work; flattering herself that 
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=14"/>

she has rendered them so explicit as to be easily understood, and followed, even by inexperienced cooks. The directions are given as minutely as if each receipt was "to stand alone by itself," all references to others being avoided; except in some few instances to the one immediately preceding; it being a just cause of complaint that in some of the late cookery books, the reader, before finishing the article, is desired to search out pages and numbers in remote parts of the volume.</p><p>In the hope that her system of cookery may be consulted with equal advantage by families in town and in country, by those whose condition makes it expedient to practise economy, and by others whose circumstances authorize a liberal expenditure, the author sends it to take its chance among the multitude of similar publications, satisfied that it will meet with as much success as it may be found to deserve,--more she has no right to expect.</p><p size="smaller"><emph rend="italic">Philadelphia, April</emph> 15<emph rend="italic">th,</emph> 1837.</p></div>

<hd align="center">INTRODUCTORY HINTS.</hd>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.</hd>
<p>WE recommend to all families that they should keep in the house a pair of scales, (one of the scales deep enough to hold flour, sugar, &amp;c., conveniently,) and a set of tin measures: as accuracy in proportioning the ingredients is indispensable to success in cookery. It is best to have the scales permanently fixed to a small beam projecting (for instance) from one of the shelves of the store-room. This will preclude the frequent inconvenience of their getting twisted, unlinked, and otherwise out of order; a common consequence of putting them in and out of their box, and carrying them from place to place. The weights (of which there should be a set from two pounds to a quarter of an ounce) ought carefully to be kept in the box, that none of them may be lost or mislaid.</p><p>A set of tin measures (with small spouts or lips) from a gallon down to half a jill, will be found very convenient in every kitchen; though common pitchers, bowls, glasses, &amp;c. may be substituted. It is also well to have a set of wooden measures from a bushel to a quarter of a peck.</p><p>Let it be remembered, that of liquid measure--</p>
<list align="center"><item>Two jills are half a pint.</item>
<item>Two pints -- one quart.</item>
<item>Four quarts -- one gallon.</item>

<p>Of dry measure--</p>

<item>One gallon -- half a peck.</item>
<item>Two gallons -- one peck.</item>
<item>Four gallons -- half a bushel.</item>
<item>Eight gallons -- one bushel.</item>
</list>
<p>About twenty-five drops of any thin liquid will fill a common sized tea-spoon.</p><p>Four table-spoonfuls or half a jill, will fill a common wine glass.</p><p>Four wine glasses will fill a half-pint or common <implement>tumbler,</implement> or a large coffee-cup.</p><p>A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half.</p><p>Of flour, butter, sugar, and most articles used in cakes and pastry, a quart is generally about equal in quantity to a pound avoirdupois, (sixteen ounces.) Avoirdupois is the weight designated throughout this book.</p><p>Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken.</p><p>A table-spoonful of salt is generally about one ounce.</p></subdiv>

<chapter class1="soups">
<hd align="center">SOUPS.</hd>
<section class1="soups">
<hd>GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>Always use soft water for making soup, and be careful to proportion the quantity of water to that of the meat. Somewhat less than a quart of water to a pound of meat, is a good rule for common soups. Rich soups, intended for company, may have a still smaller allowance of water.</p><p>Soup should always be made entirely of fresh meat that has not been previously cooked. An exception to this rule may sometimes be made in favour of the remains of a piece of roast beef that has been <emph rend="italic">very much</emph> under-done in roasting. This may be <emph rend="italic">added</emph> to a good piece of raw meat. Cold ham, also, may be occasionally put into white soups.</p><p>Soup made of cold meat has always a vapid, disagreeable taste, very perceptible through all the seasoning, and which nothing indeed can disguise. Also, it will be of a bad, dingy colour. The juices of the meat having been exhausted by the first cooking, the undue proportion of watery liquid renders it, for soup, indigestible and unwholesome, as well as unpalatable. As there is little or no nutriment to be derived from soup made with cold meat, it is better to refrain from using it for this purpose, and to devote the leavings of the table to some other object. No person accustomed to really 
 
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=20"/>

good soup, made from fresh meat, can ever be deceived in the taste, even when flavoured with wine and spices. It is not true that French cooks have the act of producing <emph rend="italic">excellent</emph>soups from cold scraps. There is much <emph rend="italic">bad</emph> soup to be found in France, at inferior houses; but <emph rend="italic">good</emph> French cooks are not, as is generally supposed, really in the practice of concocting any dishes out of the refuse of the table. And we repeat, that cold meat, even when perfectly good, and used in a large quantity, has not sufficient substance to flavour soup, or to render it wholesome.</p><p>Soup, however, that has been originally made of raw meat entirely, is frequently better the second day than the first; provided that it is re-boiled only for a very short time, and that no additional water is added to it.</p><p>Unless it has been allowed to boil too hard, so as to exhaust the water, the <implement>soup-pot</implement> will not require replenishing. When it is found absolutely necessary to do so, the additional water must be boiling hot when poured in; if lukewarm or cold, it will entirely spoil the soup.</p><p>Every particle of fat should be carefully skimmed from the surface. Greasy soup is disgusting and unwholesome. The lean of meat is much better for soup than the fat.</p><p>Long and slow boiling is necessary to extract the strength from the meat. If boiled fast over a large fire, the meat becomes hard and tough, and will not give out its juices.</p><p>Potatoes, if boiled in the soup, are thought by some to render it unwholesome, from the opinion that the water in which potatoes have been cooked is almost a poison. As potatoes are a part of every dinner, it is very easy to take a few out of the pot in which they have been boiled by themselves, and to cut them up and add them to the soup just before it goes to table.</p>
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=21"/>

<p>The cook should season the soup but very slightly with salt and pepper. If she puts in too much, it may spoil it for the taste of most of those that are to eat it; but if too little, it is easy to add more to your own plate.</p><p>The practice of thickening soup by stirring flour into it is not a good one, as it spoils both the appearance and the taste. If made with a sufficient quantity of good fresh meat, and not too much water, and if boiled long and slowly, it will have substance enough without flour.</p></section>
<recipe class1="soups"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FAMILY SOUP.</purpose>

Take a <ingredient>shin or leg of beef</ingredient> that has been newly killed; the fore leg is best, as there is the most meat on it. Have it cut into three pieces, and wash it well. To each pound allow somewhat less than a quart of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> for instance, to ten pounds of <ingredient>leg of beef,</ingredient> nine quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> is a good proportion. Put it into a large pot, and add half a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Hang it over a good fire, as early as six o'clock in the morning, if you dine at two. When it has come to a hard boil, and the scum has risen, (which it will do as soon as it has boiled,) skim it well. Do not remove the lid more frequently than is absolutely necessary, as uncovering the pot causes the flavour to evaporate. Then set it on hot coals in the corner, and keep it simmering steadily, adding fresh coals so as to continue a regular heat.</p><p>About nine o'clock, put in four <ingredient>carrots,</ingredient> one <ingredient>parsnip,</ingredient> and a large <ingredient>onion</ingredient> cut into slices, and four small <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> and eight <ingredient>tomatas,</ingredient> also cut up; add a head of <ingredient>celery</ingredient> cut small. Put in a very small head of <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> cut into little pieces. If you have any objection to <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> substitute a larger proportion 
 
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=22"/>

of the other vegetables. Put in also a bunch of <ingredient>sweet marjoram,</ingredient> tied up in a thin muslin rag to prevent its floating to the top.</p><p>Let the soup simmer unceasingly till two o'clock, skimming it well: then take it up, and put it into a <implement>tureen.</implement> If your dinner hour is later, you may of course begin the soup later; but it will require at least eight hours' cooking; remembering to put in the vegetables three hours after the meat.</p><p>If you wish to send the meat to table, take the best part of it out of the soup, about two hours before dinner. Have ready another pot with a dozen <ingredient>tomatas</ingredient> and a few <ingredient>cloves.</ingredient> Moisten them with a little of the soup, just sufficient to keep them from burning. When the tomatas have stewed down soft, put the meat upon them, and let it brown till dinner time over a few coals, keeping the pot closely covered: then send it to table on a dish by itself. Let the remainder of the meat be left in the large pot till you send up the soup, as by that time it will be boiled to rags and have transferred all its flavour to the liquid.</p><p>This soup will be greatly improved by the addition of a few dozen <ingredient>ochras</ingredient> cut into very thin slices, and put in with the other vegetables. You may put <ingredient>Lima beans</ingredient> into it, <ingredient>green peas,</ingredient> or indeed any vegetables you like: or you may thicken it with <ingredient>ochras</ingredient> and <ingredient>tomatas</ingredient> only.</p><p>Next day, take what is left of the soup, put it into a pot, and simmer it over hot coals for half an hour: a longer time will weaken the taste. If it has been well made and kept in a cool place, it will be found better the second day than the first.</p><p>If your family is very small, and the <ingredient>leg of beef</ingredient> large, and the season winter, it may furnish soup for four successive days. Cut the beef in half; make soup of the first half, in
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=23"/>

the manner above directed, and have the remainder warmed next day: then on the third day make fresh soup of the second half.</p><p>We have been minute in these directions; for if strictly followed, the soup, though plain, will be found excellent.</p><p>If you do not intend to serve up the meat separately, break to pieces all the bones with a mallet or kitchen <implement>cleaver.</implement> This, by causing them to give out their marrow, &amp;c., will greatly enrich the liquid. Do this, of course, when you first begin the soup.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="soups"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FINE BEEF SOUP.</purpose>

BEGIN this soup the day before it is wanted. Take a good piece of fresh <ingredient>beef</ingredient> that has been newly killed: any substantial part will do that has not too much fat about it: a <ingredient>fore leg</ingredient> is very good for this purpose. Wash it well. Cut off all the meat, and break up the bones. Put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> into a large pot, very early in the day, so as to allow eight or nine hours for its boiling. Proportion the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to the quantity of meat--about a pint and a half to each pound. Sprinkle the meat with a small quantity of <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Pour on the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> hang it over a moderate fire, and boil it slowly; carefully skimming off all the fat that rises to the top, and keeping it closely covered, except when you raise the lid to skim it. Do not, on any account, put in additional <ingredient>water</ingredient> to this soup while it is boiling; and take care that the boiling goes steadily on, as, if it stops, the soup will be much injured. But if the fire is too great, and the soup boils too fast, the meat will become hard and tough, and will not give out its juices.</p> 
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=24"/>

<p>After the meat is reduced to rags, and the soup sufficiently boiled, remove the pot from the fire, and let it stand in the corner for a quarter of an hour to settle. Then take it up, strain it into a large earthen pan, cover it, and set it away in a cool dry place till next day. Straining it makes it clear and bright, and frees it from the shreds of meat and bone. If you find that it jellies in the pan, (which it will if properly made,) do not disturb it till you are ready to put it into the pot for the second boiling, as breaking the jelly may prevent it from keeping well.</p><p>On the following morning, boil separately, <ingredient>carrots,</ingredient> <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> and whatever other vegetables you intend to thicken the soup with. <ingredient>Tomatas</ingredient> will greatly improve it. Prepare them by taking off the skin, cutting them into small pieces, and stewing them in their own juice till they are entirely dissolved. Put on the <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> before any of the other vegetables, as they require the longest time to boil. Or you may slice and put into the soup a portion of the vegetables you are boiling for dinner; but they must be nearly done before you put them in, as the second boiling of the soup should not exceed half an hour, or indeed, just sufficient time to heat it thoroughly.</p><p>Scrape off carefully from the cake of jellied soup whatever fat or sediment may still be remaining on it; divide the jelly into pieces, and about half an hour before it is to go to table, put it into a pot, add the various vegetables, (having first sliced them,) in sufficient quantities to make the soup very thick; hang it over the fire and let it boil slowly, or simmer steadily till dinner time.

day, as the soup is to be strained; and on the second day, if put in raw, the length of time required to cook them would spoil the soup by doing it too much. We repeat, that when soup has been sufficiently boiled on the first day, and all the juices and flavour of the meat thoroughly extracted, half an hour is the utmost it requires on the second.</p><p>Carefully avoid seasoning it too highly. Soup, otherwise excellent, is frequently spoiled by too much <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> These condiments can be added at table, according to the taste of those that are eating it; but if too large a proportion of them is put in by the cook, there is then no remedy, and the soup may by some be found uneatable.</p><p>Many persons prefer boiling all the vegetables in the soup on the first day, thinking that they improve its flavour. This may be done in common soup that is not to be strained, but is inadmissible if you wish it to be very bright and clear. Also, unless you have a garden and a profusion of vegetables of your own, it is somewhat extravagant, as when strained out they are of no further use, and are therefore wasted.</p></recipe>

<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">REMARKS.</hd>
<p>IN choosing fresh fish, select only those that are thick and firm, with bright scales and stiff fins; the gills a very lively red, and the eyes full and prominent. In the summer, as soon as they are brought home, clean them, and put them in ice till you are ready to cook them; and even then do not attempt to keep a fresh fish till next day. Mackerel cannot be cooked too soon, as they spoil more readily than any other fish.</p><p>Oysters in the shell may be kept from a week to a fortnight, by the following process. Cover them with water, and wash them clean with a birch broom. Then lay them with the deep or concave part of the shell undermost, and sprinkle each of them well with salt and Indian meal. Fill up the tub with cold water. Repeat this every day; first pouring off the liquid of the day before.</p><p>The tub must stand all the time in a cool cellar, and be covered well with an old blanket, carpeting, or something of the sort.</p><p>If carefully attended to, oysters kept in this manner will not only live but fatten.</p><p>It is customary to eat fish only at the commencement of the dinner. Fish and soup are generally served up alone, before any of the other dishes appear, and with no vegetable but potatoes; it being considered a solecism in good taste to accompany them with any of the other productions of the garden except a little horse-radish, parsley, &amp;c. as garnishing.</p><p>In England, and at the most fashionable tables in America, bread only is eaten with fish. To this rule salt cod is an exception.</p></section>

<hd align="center">DIRECTIONS FOR COOKING MEAT.</hd>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">BEEF.</hd>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>WHEN beef is good, it will have a fine smooth open grain, and it will feel tender when squeezed or pinched in your fingers. The lean should be of a bright carnation red, and the fat white rather than yellow--the suet should be perfectly white. If the lean looks dark or purplish, and the fat very yellow, do not buy the meat.</p><p>See that the butcher has properly jointed the meat before it goes home. For good tables, the pieces generally roasted are the sirloin and the fore and middle ribs. In genteel houses other parts are seldom served up as <emph rend="italic">roast-beef.</emph> In small families the ribs are the most convenient pieces. A whole sirloin is too large, except for a numerous company, but it is the piece most esteemed.</p><p>The best beef-steaks are those cut from the ribs, or from the inner part of the sirloin. All other pieces are, for this purpose, comparatively hard and tough.</p><p>The round is generally corned or salted, and boiled. It is also used for the dish called beef &#224;-la-mode.</p><p>The legs make excellent soup; the head and tail are also used for that purpose.</p><p>The tongue when fresh is never cooked except for mince-pies. Corned or salted it is seldom liked, as in that state in has a faint sickly taste that few persons can relish. But 
 
<pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=75"/>

when pickled and afterwards smoked (the only good way of preparing a tongue) it is highly and deservedly esteemed.</p><p>The other pieces of the animal are generally salted and boiled. Or when fresh they may be used for soup or stews, if not too fat.</p><p>If the state of the weather will allow you to keep fresh beef two or three days, rub it with salt, and wrap it in a cloth.</p><p>In summer do not attempt to keep it more than twenty-four hours; and not then unless you can conveniently lay it in ice, or in a <implement>spring-house.</implement></p><p>In winter if the beef is brought from market frozen, do not cook it that day unless you dine very late, as it will be impossible to get it sufficiently done--meat that has been frozen requiring double the usual time. To thaw it, lay it in cold water, which is the only way to extract the frost without injuring the meat. It should remain in the water three hours, or more.</p></subsection>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO ROAST BEEF.</purpose>

THE fire should be prepared at least half an hour before the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is put down, and it should be large, steady, clear, and bright, with plenty of fine hot coals at the bottom.</p><p>The best apparatus for the purpose is the well-known <implement>roaster</implement> frequently called a <implement>tin-kitchen.</implement></p><p>Wash the meat in cold water, and then wipe it dry, and rub it with <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Take care not to run the spit through the best parts of it. It is customary with some cooks to tie blank paper over the fat, to prevent it from melting and wasting too fast.</p><p>Put it evenly into the <implement>roaster,</implement> and do not set it too near the fire, lest the outside of the meat should be burned before the inside is heated.</p> 
 
<pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=76"/>

<p>Put some nice <ingredient>beef-dripping</ingredient> or some <ingredient>lard</ingredient> into the pan or bottom of the <implement>roaster,</implement> and as soon as it melts begin to baste the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> with it; taking up the liquid with a long spoon, and pouring it over the meat so as to let it trickle down again into the pan. Repeat this frequently while it is roasting; after a while you can baste it with its own fat. Turn the spit often, so that the meat may be equally done on all sides.</p><p>Once or twice draw back the <implement>roaster,</implement> and improve the fire by clearing away the ashes, bringing forward the hot coals, and putting on fresh fuel at the back. Should a coal fall into the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> take it out immediately.</p><p>An allowance of about twenty minutes to each pound of meat is the time commonly given for roasting; but this rule, like most others, admits of exceptions according to circumstances. Also, some persons like their meat very much done; others prefer it rare, as it is called. In summer, meat will roast in a shorter time than in winter.</p><p>When the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is nearly done, and the steam draws towards the fire, remove the paper that has covered the fat part, sprinkle on a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and having basted the meat well with the dripping, pour off nicely (through the spout of the <implement>roaster</implement>) all the liquid fat from the top of the gravy.</p><p>Lastly, dredge the meat very lightly with a little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and baste it with fresh <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> This will give it a delicate froth. To the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> that is now running from the meat add nothing but a tea-cup of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> Skim it, and send it to table in a boat. Serve up with the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> in a small deep plate, scraped horseradish moistened with vinegar.</p><p>Fat meat requires more roasting than lean, and meat that has been frozen will take nearly double the usual time.</p><p>Basting the meat continually with flour and water

practice, as it gives it a coddled par-boiled appearance, and diminishes the flavour.</p><p><variation>These directions for roasting beef will apply equally to <purpose><alt synonym1="roasted mutton">mutton.</alt></purpose>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO SAVE BEEF-DRIPPING.</purpose>

POUR off through the spout of the <implement>roaster</implement> or <implement>tin-kitchen,</implement> all the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the top of the gravy, after you have done basting the meat with it. Hold a little sieve under the spout, and strain the dripping through it into a pan. Set it away in a cool place; and next day when it is cold and congealed, turn the cake of <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and scrape with a knife the sediment from the bottom. Put the dripping into a jar; cover it tightly, and set it away in the refrigerator, or in the coldest place you have. It will be found useful for frying, and for many other purposes.</p><p>Mutton-dripping cannot be used for any sort of cooking, as it communicates to every thing the taste of tallow.</p></recipe>

Press down the mashed potatoes hard with the back of a spoon, score them in cross lines over the top, and let them brown under the meat, serving them up laid round it.</variation></p><p><variation>Instead of potatoes, you may put in the bottom of the pan what is called a Yorkshire pudding, to be baked under the meat.</variation></p><p>To make this pudding,--stir gradually four table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a pint of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> adding a salt-spoon of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Beat three <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> very light, and mix them gradually with the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> See that the batter is not lumpy.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO BOIL CORNED OR SALTED BEEF.</purpose>

THE best piece is the round. You may either boil it whole, or divide it into two, or even three pieces if it is large, taking care that each piece shall have a portion of the fat. Wash it well; and, if very salt, soak it in two waters. Skewer it up tightly and in a good compact shape, wrapping the flap piece firmly round it. Tie it round with broad strong tape, or with a strip of coarse linen. Put it into a large pot, and cover it well with <ingredient>water.</ingredient> It will be found a convenience to lay it on a <implement>fish drainer.</implement></p><p>Hang it over a moderate fire that it may heat gradually all through. Carefully take off the scum as it rises, and when no more appears, keep the pot closely covered, and let it boil slowly and regularly, with the fire at an equal temperature. Allow three hours and a half to a piece weighing about twelve pounds, and from that to four or five hours in proportion to the size. Turn the meat twice in the pot while it is boiling. Put in some <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> and <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> about two hours after the meat. Many persons boil <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> in the same pot with the <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> but it is a much nicer way to do the greens in a separate vessel, lest they become saturated with the liquid fat. Cauliflower or brocoli (which are frequent accompaniments to corned beef) should never be boiled with it.</p><p>Wash the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> removing the outside leaves, and cutting the stalk close. Examine all the leaves carefully, lest insects should be lodged among them. If the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> is large, divide it into quarters. Put it into a pot of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> with a handful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and boil it till the stalk is quite tender. Half an hour will generally be sufficient for a small young <ingredient>cabbage;</ingredient> an hour for a large full-grown one. 
 
<pb n="74" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=80"/>

Drain it well before you dish it. If boiled separately from the meat, have ready some melted butter to eat with it.</p><p>Should you find the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> under-done, you may reboil it next day; putting it into <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and letting it simmer for half an hour or more, according to its size.</p><p>Cold corned beef will keep very well for some days wrapped in several folds of a thick linen cloth, and set away in a cool dry place.</p><p>In carving a round of beef, slice it horizontally and very thin. Do not help any one to the outside pieces, as they are generally too hard and salt.

<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>THE fore-quarter of a calf comprises the neck, breast, and shoulder: the hind-quarter consists of the loin, fillet, and knuckle. Separate dishes are made of the head, heart, liver, and sweetbread. The flesh of good veal is firm and dry, and the joints stiff. The lean is of a very light delicate red, and the fat quite white. In buying the head see that the eyes look full, plump, and lively; if they are dull and sunk the calf has been killed too long. In buying calves' feet for jelly or soup, endeavour to get those that have been singed only and not skinned; as a great deal of gelatinous substance is contained in the skin. Veal should always be thoroughly cooked, and never brought to table rare or under-done, like beef or mutton. The least redness in the meat or gravy is disgusting.</p><p>Veal suet may be used as a substitute for that of beef; also veal-dripping.</p></subsection>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO ROAST A LOIN OF VEAL.</purpose>

THE loin is the best part of the calf. It is always roasted. See that your fire is clear and hot, and broad enough to brown both ends. Cover the fat of the kidney and the back with paper to prevent it from scorching. A large <ingredient>loin of veal</ingredient> will require <emph rend="italic">at least</emph> four hours and a half to roast it sufficiently. At first set the <implement>roaster</implement> at a tolerable distance from the fire that the meat may heat gradually in the beginning; afterwards place it nearer. Put a little <ingredient>salt and water</ingredient> into the <implement>dripping-pan</implement>

and baste the meat with it till the gravy begins to drop. Then baste with the gravy. When the meat is nearly done, move it close to the fire, dredge it with a very little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and baste it with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Skim the fat from the gravy, which should be thickened by shaking in a very small quantity of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Put it into a small sauce-pan, and set it on hot coals. Let it just come to a boil, and then send it to table in a boat. If the gravy is not in sufficient quantity, add to it about half a jill or a large wine-glass of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient></p><p>In carving a <ingredient>loin of veal</ingredient> help every one to a piece of the kidney as far as it will go.</p></recipe>

The vein in the neck of the fore-quarter should be a fine blue.</p><p>Lamb is always roasted; generally a whole quarter at once.

<hd align="center">PORK, HAM, &amp;c.</hd>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>IN cutting up pork, you have the spare-rib, shoulder, griskin or chine, the loin, middlings and leg; the head, feet, heart and liver. On the spare-rib and chine there is but little meat, and the pieces called middlings consist almost entirely of fat. The best parts are the loin, and the leg or hind-quarter. Hogs make the best pork when from two and a half to four years old. They should be kept up and fed with corn at least six weeks before they are killed, or their flesh will acquire a disagreeable taste from the trash and offal which they eat when running at large. The Portuguese pork, which is fed on chestnuts, is perhaps the finest in the world. </p><p>If the meat is young, the lean will break on being pinched, and the skin will dent by nipping it with the fingers; the fat will be white, soft, and pulpy. If the skin or rind is rough, and cannot be nipped, it is old.</p><p>Hams that have short shank-bones, are generally prefered. If you put a knife under the bone of a ham, and it comes out clean, the meat is good; but quite the contrary if the knife appears smeared and slimy. In good bacon the fat is white, and the lean sticks close to the bone; if it is streaked with yellow, the meat is rusty, and unfit to eat.</p><p>Pork in every form should be thoroughly cooked. If the least under-done, it is disgusting and unwholesome.</p></subsection>

BEGIN your preparations by making the stuffing. Take a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>grated stale bread,</ingredient> and mix it with <ingredient>sage</ingredient> and <ingredient>sweet marjoram</ingredient> rubbed fine or powdered; also some grated <ingredient>lemon-peel.</ingredient> Season it with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> powdered <ingredient>nutmeg</ingredient> and <ingredient>mace;</ingredient> mix in <ingredient>butter</ingredient> enough to moisten it, and some beaten <ingredient>yolk of egg</ingredient> to bind it. Let the whole be very well incorporated.</p><p>The <ingredient>pig</ingredient> should be newly killed, (that morning if possible,) nicely cleaned, fat, and not too large. Wash it well in cold water, and cut off the feet close to the joints, leaving some skin all round to fold over the ends. Take out the liver and heart, and reserve them, with the feet, to make the gravy. Truss back the legs. Fill the body with the stuffing (it must be quite full) and then sew it up, or tie it round with a buttered twine. Put the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> on the spit, and place it before a clear brisk fire, but not too near lest it scorch. The fire should be largest at the ends, that the middle of the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> may not be done before the extremities. If you find the heat too great in the centre, you may diminsh it by placing a <implement>flat-iron</implement> before the fire. When you first put it down, wash the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> all over with <ingredient>salt and water;</ingredient> afterwards rub it frequently with a feather dipped in <ingredient>sweet oil,</ingredient> or with fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> tied in a rag. If you baste it with any thing else, or with its own dripping, the skin will not be crisp. Take care not to blister or burn the outside by keeping it too near the fire. A good sized pig will require at least three hours roasting.</p><p>Unless a <ingredient>pig</ingredient> is very small it is seldom sent to table whole. Take the spit from the fire, and place it across a large dish; then, having cut off the head with a sharp knife, and cut down the back, slip the spit out. Lay the two halves of the

Having boiled the <ingredient>heart,</ingredient> <ingredient>liver,</ingredient> and <ingredient>feet,</ingredient> with some minced <ingredient>sage</ingredient> in a very little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> cut the meat from the <ingredient>feet,</ingredient> and chop it.

HAM or bacon, however well cured, will never be good unless the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> of which it is made has been properly fed. The hogs should be well fattened on corn, and fed with it about eight weeks, allowing ten bushels to each hog. They are best for curing when from two to four years old, and should not weigh more then one hundred and fifty or one hundred
 
<pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=133"/>

and sixty pounds. The first four weeks they may be fed on mush, or on Indian meal moistened with water; the remaining four on corn unground; giving them always as much as they will eat. Soap-suds may be given to them three or four times a week; or oftener if convenient.</p><p>When killed and cut up, begin immediately to <ingredient>salt</ingredient> them. Rub the outside of each ham with a tea-spoonful of powdered <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and the inside with a tea-spoonful of <ingredient>cayenne pepper.</ingredient> Having mixed together <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> in the proportion of a pound and a half of <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> to a quart of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> rub the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> well with it. This quantity of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will be sufficient for fifty pounds of meat. Have ready some large tubs, the bottoms sprinkled with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and lay the meat in the tubs with the skin downward. Put plenty of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> between each layer of meat. After it has lain eight days, take it out and wipe off all the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and wash the tubs. Make a pickle of <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> equal quantites of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>saltpetre;</ingredient> allowing four ounces of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> to two quarts of <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and two quarts of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> which is the proportion for fifty pounds of meat. The pickle must be strong enough to bear up an egg. Boil and skim it; and when it is cold, pour it over the meat, which must be turned every day and basted with the pickle. The <ingredient>hams</ingredient> should remain in the pickle at least four weeks; the shoulders and middlings of the <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> three weeks; and the <ingredient>jowls</ingredient> two weeks. They should then be taken out and smoked. Having washed off the pickle, before you smoke the meat, bury it, while wet, in tub of <ingredient>bran.</ingredient> This will form a crust over it, and prevent evaporation of the juices. Let the smoke-house be ready to receive the meat immediately. Take it out of the tub after it has lain half an hour, and rub the bran evenly over 
 
<pb n="128" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=134"/>

it. Then hang it up to smoke with the small end downwards. The smoke-house should be dark and cool, and should stand alone, for the heat occasioned by an adjoining building may spoil the meat, or produce insects. Keep up a good smoke all day, but have no blaze. Hickory is the best wood for a smoke-house fire. In three or four weeks the meat will be sufficiently smoked, and fit for use. During the process it should be occasionally taken down, examined, and hung up again. The best way of keeping <ingredient>hams</ingredient> is to wrap them in paper, or to sew them in coarse cloths (which should be white-washed) and bury them in a barrel of hickory ashes.

<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>IN buying poultry choose those that are fresh and fat. Half-grown poultry is comparatively insipid; it is best when full-grown but not old. Old poultry is tough and hard. An old goose is so tough to be frequently uneatable. When poultry is young the skin is thin and tender, and can be easily ripped by trying it with a pin; the legs are smooth; the feet moist and limber; and the eyes full and bright. The body should be thick and the breast fat. The bill and feet of a young goose are yellow, and have but a few hairs on them; when old they are red and hairy.</p><p>Poultry is best when killed over night, as if cooked too soon after killing, it is hard and does not taste well. It is not the custom in America, as in some parts of Europe, to keep game, or indeed any sort of eatable, till it begins to taint; all food when inclining to decomposition being regarded by us with disgust.</p><p>When poultry or game is frozen, it should be brought into the kitchen early in the morning of the day on which it is to be cooked. It may be thawed by laying it several hours in cold water. If it is not thawed it will require double the time to cook, and will be tough and tasteless when done.</p><p>In drawing poultry be very careful not to break the gall, lest its disagreeable bitterness should be communicated to the liver.</p><p>Poultry should be always scalded in hot water to make the

feathers come out easily. Before they are cooked they should be held for a moment over the blaze of the fire to singe off the hairs that are about the skin. The head, neck, and feet should be cut off, and the ends of the legs skewered in the bodies. A string should be tied tightly round.</p></subsection>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO BOIL A PAIR OF FOWLS.</purpose>

<section class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>STORE fish sauces if properly made will keep for many months. They may be brought to table in <implement>fish castors,</implement> but a customary mode is to send them round in the small black bottles in which they have been originally depostied. They are in great variety, and may be purchased of the grocers that sell oil, pickles, anchovies, &amp;c. In making them at home, the few following receipts may be found useful.</p><p>The usual way of eating these sauces is to pour a little on your plate, and mix it with the melted butter. They give flavour to fish that would otherwise be insipid, and are in general use at genteel tables.</p><p>Two table-spoonfuls of any of these sauces may be added to the melted butter a minute before you take it from the fire. But if brought to table in bottles, the company can use it or omit it as they please.</p></section>

<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>ALL vegetables should be well picked and washed. A very little salt should always be thrown into the water in which they are boiled. A steady regular fire should be kept up, and they should never for a moment be allowed to stop boiling or simmering till they are thoroughly done. Every sort of vegetable should be cooked till tender, as if the least hard or under-done they are both unpalatable and unwholesome. The practice of putting pear-ash in the pot to improve the colour of green vegetables should be strictly forbidden, as it destroys the flavour, and either renders them flat and insipid, or communicates a very disagreeable taste of its own.</p><p>Every sort of culinary vegetable is infintely best when fresh from the garden, and gathered as short a time as possible before it is cooked. They should all be laid in a pan of cold water for a while previous to boiling.</p><p>When done, they should be carefully drained before they go to table, or they will be washy all through, and leave puddles of discoloured water in the bottoms of the dishes, to the disgust of the company and the discredit of the cook.</p></section>

<hd align="center">PICKLING.</hd>
<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>NEVER on any consideration use brass, copper, or <implement>bell-metal kettles</implement> for pickling; the verdigris produced in them by the vinegar being of a most poisonous nature. Kettles lined with porcelain are the best, but if you cannot procure them, block tin may be substitued. Iron is apt to discolour any acid that is boiled in it.</p><p>Vinegar for pickles should always be of the very best kind. In putting away pickles, use stone or glass jars. The lead which is an ingredient in the glazing of common earthenware, is rendered very pernicious by the action of the vinegar. Have a large wooden spoon and a fork, for the express purpose of taking pickles out of the jar when you want them for the table. See that, while in the jar, they are always completely covered with vinegar. If you discern in them any symptoms of not keeping well, do them over again in fresh vinegar and spice.</p><p>Vinegar for pickles should only boil five or six minutes.</p><p>The jars should be stopped with large flat corks, fitting closely, and having a leather or a round piece of oil-cloth tied over the cork.</p><p>It is a good rule to have two-thirds of the jar filled with pickles, and one-third with vinegar.</p><p>Alum is very useful in extracting the salt taste from pickles, and in making them firm and crisp. A very small quantity is sufficient. Too much will spoil them.</p> 
 
<pb n="213" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=219"/>

<hd align="center">SWEETMEATS.</hd>
<section class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">GENERAL REMARKS.</hd>
<p>THE introduction of iron ware lined with porcelain has fortunately almost superseded the use of brass or <implement>bell-metal kettles</implement> for boiling sweetmeats; a practice by which the articles prepared in those pernicious utensils were always more or less imbued with the deleterious qualities of the verdigris that is produced in them by the action of acids.</p><p>Charcoal furnaces will be found very convenient for preserving; the kettles being set on the top. They can be used in the open air. Sweetmeats should be boiled rather quickly, that the watery particles may exhale at once, without being subjected to so long a process as to spoil the colour and diminish the flavour of the fruit. But on the other hand, if boiled too short a time they will not keep so well.</p><p>If you wish your sweetmeats to look bright and clear, use only the very best loaf-sugar. Fruit may be preserved for family use and for common purposes, in sugar of inferior quality, but it will never have a good appearance, and it is also more liable to spoil.</p><p>If too small a proportion of sugar is allowed to the fruit, it will <emph rend="italic">certainly</emph> not keep well. When this experiment is tried it is generally found to be false economy; as sweetmeats, when they begin to spoil, can only be recovered and made eatable by boiling them over again with additional sugar; and even then, they are never so good as if done properly at first. If jellies have not sufficient sugar, they do not congeal, but will remain liquid.</p> 
 
<pb n="231" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=237"/>

<p><implement>Jelly bags</implement> should be made of white flannel. It is well to have a wooden stand or frame like a <implement>towel horse,</implement> to which the bag can be tied while it is dripping. The bag should first be dipped in hot water, for if dry it will absorb too much of the juice. After the liquor is all in, close the top of the bag, that none of the flavour may evaporate.</p><p>In putting away sweetmeats, it is best to place them in small jars, as the more frequently they are exposed to the air by opening, the more danger there is of their spoiling. The best vessels for this purpose are <implement>white queen's-ware pots,</implement> or glass jars. For jellies, jams, and for small fruit, common glass <implement>tumblers</implement> are very convenient, and may be covered simply with double tissue-paper, cut exactly to fit the inside of the top of the glass, laid lightly on the sweetmeat, and pressed down all round with the finger. This covering, if closely and nicely fitted, will be found to keep them perfectly well, and as it adheres so closely as to form a complete coat over the top, it is better for jellies or jams than writing-paper dipped in brandy, which is always somewhat shrivelled by the liquor with which it has been saturated.</p><p>If you find that your sweetmeats have become dry and candied, you may liquefy them again by setting the jars in water and making it boil round them.</p><p>In preserving fruit whole, it is best to put it first in a thin syrup. If boiled in a thick syrup at the beginning, the juice will be drawn out so as to shrink the fruit.</p><p>It is better to boil it but a short time at once, and then to take it out and let it get cold, afterwards returning it to the syrup, than to keep it boiling too long at a time, which will cause it to break and lose its shape.</p><p><implement>Preserving kettles</implement> should be rather broad than deep for the fruit cannot be done equally if it is too much heaped. They 
 
<pb n="232" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=238"/>

should all have covers belonging to them, to put on after the scum has done rising, that the flavour of the fruit may be kept in with the steam.</p><p>A <implement>perforated skimmer</implement> pierced all through with holes is a very necessary utensil in making sweetmeats.</p><p>The water used for melting the sugar should be very clear; spring or pump water is best. But if you are obliged to use river water, let it first be filtered. Any turbidness or impurity in the water will injure the clearness of the sweetmeats.</p><p>If sweetmeats ferment in the jars, boil them over again with add itional sugar.</p></section>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CLARIFIED SUGAR SYRUP.</purpose>

TAKE eight pounds of the best double-refined <ingredient>loaf-sugar,</ingredient> and break it up or powder it. Have ready the <ingredient>whites of two eggs,</ingredient> beaten to a strong froth. Stir the <ingredient>white of egg</ingredient> gradually into two quarts of very clear spring or <ingredient>pump water.</ingredient> Put the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> into a porcelain kettle, and mix with it the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>white of egg.</ingredient> While the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is melting, stir it frequently; and when it is entirely dissolved, put the kettle over a moderate fire, and let it boil, carefully taking off the scum as it comes to the top, and pouring in a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> when you find the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> rising so as to run over the edge of the kettle. It will be well when it first boils hard to pour in half a pint of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to keep down the bubbles so that the scum may appear, and be easily removed. You must not however boil it to candy height, so that the bubbles will look like hard pearls, and the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> will harden in the spoon and hang from it in strings; for though very thick and clear it must continue liquid. When it is done, let it stand till it gets quite cold; and if you do not want it for immediate use, put it into bottles and seal the corks.</p> 
 
<pb n="233" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=239"/>

<p>When you wish to use this <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> for preserving, you have only to put the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> into it, and boil it till tender and clear, but not till it breaks. Large <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> that is done whole, should first be boiled tender in a very thin <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> that it may not shrink. Small <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> such as <ingredient>raspberries,</ingredient> <ingredient>strawberries,</ingredient> <ingredient>grapes,</ingredient> <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> <ingredient>gooseberries,</ingredient> &amp;c. may, if perfectly ripe, be put raw into strong <ingredient>cold sugar syrup;</ingredient> they will thus retain their form and colour, and their freshness and natural taste. They must be put into small glass jars, and kept well covered with the <ingredient>syrup.</ingredient> This, however, is an experiment which sometimes fails, and had best be tried on a scale, or only for immediate use.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO PRESERVE GINGER.</purpose>

TAKE root of <ingredient>green ginger,</ingredient> and pare it neatly with a sharp knife, throwing it into a pan of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as you pare it. Then boil it till tender all through, changing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> three times. Each time put on the <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> in quite <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to take out the excessive heat. When it is perfectly tender, throw it again into a pan of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let it lie an hour or more; this will make it crisp. In the mean time prepare the <ingredient>syrup.</ingredient></p><p>For every six pounds of <ingredient>ginger root,</ingredient> clarify seven pounds of the best double-refined <ingredient>loaf-sugar.</ingredient> Break up the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> put it into a <implement>preserving kettle,</implement> and melt it in spring or <ingredient>pump water,</ingredient> (into which you have stirred gradually the beaten <ingredient>white of two eggs,</ingredient>) allowing a pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to each pound of <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Boil and skim it well. Then let the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> stand till it is cold; and having drained the <ingredient>ginger,</ingredient> pour the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> over it, cover it, and do not disturb it for two days. Then, having poured it from the <ingredient>ginger,</ingredient> boil the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> over again.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">THE BEST PLAIN PASTE.</purpose>

ALL <ingredient>paste</ingredient> should be made in a very cool place, as heat renders it heavy. It is far more difficult to get it light in summer than in winter. A marble slab is much better to roll it on than a <ingredient>paste</ingredient>-board. It will be improved in lightness by washing the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in very <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and squeezing and pressing out all the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is injurious to <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> In New York and in the Eastern states, it is customary, in the dairies, to put more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in what is called fresh <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> than in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. This <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> therefore, should always undergo the process of washing and squeezing before it is used for pastry or cakes. None but the very best <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be taken for those purposes; as any unpleasant taste is always increased by baking. Potted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> never makes good <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> As pastry is by no means an article of absolute necessity, it is better not to have it at all, than to make it badly, and of inferior ingredients; few things being more unwholesome than hard, heavy dough. The <ingredient>flour</ingredient> for <ingredient>paste</ingredient> should always be superfine.</p><p>You may bake <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in deep dishes or in <implement>soup plates.</implement> For shells that are to be baked empty, and afterwards filled with stewed <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweetmeats,</ingredient> deep plates of block tin with broad edges are best. If you use <implement>patty-pans,</implement> the more flat they are the better. <ingredient>Paste</ingredient> always rises higher and is more perfectly light and flaky, when unconfined at the sides while baking. That it may be easily taken out, the dishes or tins should be well buttered.</p> 
 
<pb n="273" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=279"/>

<p>To make a nice plain <ingredient>paste,</ingredient>--sift three pints of superfine <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> by rubbing it through a sieve into a deep pan. Divide a pound of fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into four quarters. Cut up one quarter into the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and rub it fine with your hands. Mix in, gradually, as much <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as will make a tolerably stiff dough, and then knead it slightly. Use as little <ingredient>water</ingredient> as possible or the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will be tough. Sprinkle a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on your <implement>paste-board,</implement> lay the lump of dough upon it, and knead it a very short time. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> it, and roll it out into a very thin sheet, always rolling from you. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> your rolling-pin to prevent its sticking. Take a second quarter of the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and with your thumb, spread it all over the sheet of <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> If your hand is warm, use a knife instead of your thumb; for if the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> oils, the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will be heavy. When you have put on the layer of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> sprinkle it with a very little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and with your hands roll up the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> as you would a sheet of <ingredient>paper.</ingredient> Then flatten it with a rolling-pin, and roll it out a second time into a thin sheet. Cover it with another layer of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> as before, and again roll it up into a scroll. Flatten it again, put on the last layer of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> it slightly, and again roll up the sheet. Then cut the scroll into as many pieces as you want sheets for your dishes or <implement>patty-pans.</implement> Roll out each piece almost an inch thick. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> your dishes, lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> lightly on them, notch the edges, and bake it a light brown. The oven must be moderate. If it is too hot, the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will bake before it has risen sufficiently. If too cold, it will scarcely rise at all, and will be white and clammy. When you begin to make <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in this manner, do not quit it till it is ready for the oven. It must always be baked in a close oven where no air can reach it.</p><p>The best rolling-pins, are those that are straight, and as thick at the ends as in the middle. They should be held by

the handles, and the longer the handles the more convenient. The common rolling-pins that decrease in size towards the ends, are much less effective, and more tedious, as they can roll so little at a time; the extremities not pressing on the dough at all.</p><p>All pastry is best when fresh.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">LEMON ICE CREAM.</purpose>

HAVE ready two quarts of very rich thick <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and take out a pint. Stir gradually into the pint, a pound of the best <ingredient>loaf-sugar</ingredient> powdered fine; and the grated <ingredient>rind</ingredient> and the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> of 
 
<pb n="323" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=329"/>

four ripe <ingredient>lemons</ingredient> of the largest size, or of five or six smaller ones. If you cannot procure the <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> you may flavour the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with essence or <ingredient>oil</ingredient> of <ingredient>lemon;</ingredient> a tea-spoonful or more, according to its strength. The strongest and best essence of <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> is the <ingredient>white</ingredient> or whitish; when tinged with green, it is comparatively weak, having been diluted with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> if quite green, a large tea-spoonful will not communicate as much flavour as five or six drops of the white. After you have mixed the pint of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> beat it gradually and hard into the remaining <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> that is, the three pints. Cover it, and let it stand to infuse from half an hour to an hour. Then taste it, and if you think it necessary, stir in a little more <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> or a little more <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Strain it into the freezer through a fine strainer, (a tin one with small close holes is best,) to get rid of the grated <ingredient>lemon-peel,</ingredient> which if left in would prevent the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from being smooth. Cover the freezer, and stand it in the ice <ingredient>cream</ingredient> tub, which should be filled with a mixture, in equal quantities, of <ingredient>coarse salt,</ingredient> and ice broken up as small as possible, that it may lie close and compact round the freezer, and thus add to its coldness. Snow, when it can be procured, is still better than ice to mix with the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> It should be packed closely into the tub, and pressed down hard. Keep turning the freezer about by the handle till the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is frozen, which it will generally be in two hours. Occasionally open the lid and scrape down the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from the sides with a long-handled tin spoon. Take care that no <ingredient>salt</ingredient> gets in, or the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will be spoiled. When it is entirely frozen, take it out of the freezer and put it into your mould; set it again in the tub, (which must be filled with fresh ice and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient>) and leave it undisturbed till you want it for immediate use. This second freezing, however, should not continue longer than two hours, or the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will 
 
<pb n="324" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=330"/>

become inconveniently and unpleasantly hard, and have much of the flavour frozen out of it. Place the mould in the ice tub, with the <ingredient>head</ingredient> downwards, and cover the tub with pieces of old carpet while the second freezing is going on. When it has arrived at the proper consistence, and it is time to serve it up, dip a cloth in <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> and wrap it round the mould for a few moments, to loosen the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and make it come out easily; setting the mould on a glass or china dish. If a pyramid or obelisk mould, lift it carefully off the top. If the mould or form represents doves, dolphins, lap-dogs, <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> baskets, &amp;c. it will open down the middle, and must be taken off in that manner. Serve it up immediately lest it begin to melt. Send round sponge-cake with it, and <ingredient>wine</ingredient> or cordials immediately after.</p><p>If you have no moulds, but intend serving it up in a large bowl or in glasses, it must still be frozen twice over; otherwise it can have no smoothness, delicacy, or consistence, but will be rough and coarse, and feel in the mouth like broken icicles. The second freezing (if you have no mould) must be done in the freezer, which should be washed out, and set again in the tub with fresh ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Cover it closely, and let the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> stand in it untouched, but not less than two hours. When you put it into glasses, heap it high on the top.</p><p>Begin to make <ingredient>ice cream</ingredient> about five or six hours before it is wanted for use. If you commence it too early, it may probably be injured by having to remain too long in the second freezing, as it must not be turned out till a few moments before it is served up. In damp wea ther it requires a longer time to freeze.</p><p><variation>If <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is scarce, mix with it an equal quantity of <ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> and then add, for each quart, two table-spoonfuls of powdered <ingredient>arrow-root</ingredient> rubbed smooth in a little <ingredient>cold milk.</ingredient></variation> <variation><purpose>Orange ice cream</purpose>

<hd align="center">GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</hd>
<p>UNLESS you are provided with proper and convenient utensils and materials, the difficulty of preparing cakes will be great, and in most instances a failure; involving disappointment, waste of time, and useless expense. Accuracy in proportioning the ingredients is indispensable; and therefore scales and weights, and a set of tin measures (at least from a quart down to a jill) are of the utmost importance. A large sieve for flour is also necessary; and smaller ones for sugar and spice. There should be a <implement>marble mortar,</implement> or one of lignum vit&#230;, (the hardest of all wood;) those of iron (however well tinned) are apt to discolour the articles pounded in them. Spice may be ground in a mill kept exclusively for that purpose. Every kitchen should be provided with spice-boxes. You should have a large <implement>grater</implement> for lemon, cocoa-nut, &amp;c., and a small one for nutmeg. Butter and sugar cannot be stirred together conveniently without a spaddle or spattle, which is a round stick flattened at one end; and a deep earthen pan with sides nearly straight. For beating eggs, you should have hickory rods or a wire whip, and broad shallow earthen pans. Neither the eggs, nor the butter and sugar should be beaten in tin, as the coldness of the metal will prevent them from becoming light.</p><p>For baking large cakes, the pans (whether of block tin or earthen) should have straight sides; if the sides slope inward, there will be much difficulty in icing the cake. Pans with a hollow tube going up from the centre, are supposed to diffuse the heat more equally through the middle of the cake. Buns and some other cakes should be baked in square shallow 
 
<pb n="335" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=341"/>

pans of block tin or iron. Little tins for queen cakes, &amp;c. are most convenient when of a round or oval shape. All <implement>baking pans,</implement> whether large or small, should be well greased with butter or lard before the mixture is put into them, and should be filled but little more than half. You should have at least two dozen little tins, that a second supply may be ready for the oven the moment the first is taken out. You will also want tin cutters for cakes that are rolled out in dough.</p><p>All the utensils should be cleaned and put away as soon as they are done with. They should be all kept together, and, if possible, not used for any other purposes.<ref target="n8">*</ref></p> <p>As it is always desirable that cake-making should be commenced at an early hour, it is well on the day previous to ascertain if all the materials are in the house; that there may be no unnecessary delay from sending or waiting for them in the morning. Wastefulness is to be avoided in every thing; but it is utterly impossible that cakes can be good (or indeed any thing else) without a liberal allowance of good materials. Cakes are frequently rendered hard, heavy, and uneatable by a misplaced economy in eggs and butter; or tasteless and insipid for want of their due seasoning of spice, lemon, &amp;c.</p>
<ednote>The following note appears on the bottom of page 335 in the original text.</ednote>
<p size="smaller" id="n8">* All the utensils necessary for cake and pastry-making, (and for the other branches of cooking,) may be purchased in Philadelphia; at Gideon Cox's household store in Market street, No. 335, two doors below Ninth. Every thing of the sort will be found there in great variety, of good quality, and at reasonable prices.</p><p>Use no <ingredient>flour</ingredient> but the best superfine; if the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is of inferior quality, the cakes will be heavy, ill-coloured, and unfit to eat. Even the best <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should always be sifted. No <ingredient>butter</ingredient> that is not fresh and good; should ever be put into cakes; for it will give them a disagreeable taste which can never be disguised by the other ingredients. Even when of excellent quality, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will be improved by washing it in cold

<ingredient>water,</ingredient> and squeezing and pressing it. Except for gingerbread, use only <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> (for the finest cakes the best loaf,) and have it pulverized by pounding it in a <implement>mortar,</implement> or crushing it on the <implement>pasteboard</implement> with the rolling-pin. It should then be sifted. In mixing <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> sift the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> into a deep pan, cut up the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in it, set it in a warm place to soften, and then stir it very hard with the spaddle, till it becomes quite light, and of the consistence of <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> In preparing <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> break them one at a time, into a saucer, that, in case there should be a bad one among them, it may not spoil the others. Put them into a broad shallow pan, and beat them with rods or with a <implement>wire whisk,</implement> not merely till they froth, but long afterwards, till the froth subsides, and they become thick and smooth like <ingredient>boiled custard.</ingredient> <ingredient>White of egg</ingredient> by itself may be beaten with small rods, or with a three-pronged fork, or a broad knife. It is a very easy process, and should be continued till the liquid is all converted into a stiff froth so firm that it will not drop from the rods when held up. In damp weather it is sometimes difficult to get the froth stiff.</p><p>The first thing to be done in making cake, is to weigh or measure all the ingredients. Next sift the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> powder the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> pound or grind the <ingredient>spice,</ingredient> and prepare the <ingredient>fruit;</ingredient> afterwards mix and stir the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and lastly beat the <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> as, if allowed to stand any time, they will fall and become heavy. When all the ingredients are mixed together, they should be stirred very hard at the last; and (unless there is <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in the cake) the sooner it is put into the oven the better. While baking, no air should be admitted to it, except for a moment, now and then, when it is necessary to examine if it is baking properly. For baking cakes, the best guide is practice and experience; so much depending on the state of the fire, that it is impossible to lay down any infallible rules.

If you bake in a <implement>Dutch oven,</implement> let the lid be first heated by standing it up before the fire; and cover the inside of the bottom with sand or ashes, to temper the heat. For the same purpose, when you bake in a stove, place bricks under the pans. Sheets of iron without sides will be found very useful for baking small flat cakes. For cakes of this description, the fire should be brisk; if baked slowly, they will spread, lose their shape, and run into each other. For all cakes, the heat should be regular and even; if one part of the oven is cooler than another, the cake will bake imperfectly, and have heavy streaks through it. Gingerbread (on account of the <ingredient>molasses</ingredient>) is more apt to scorch and burn than any other cake; therefore it should be baked with a moderate fire.</p><p>It is safest, when practicable, to send all large cakes to a professional baker's; provided they can be put immediately into the oven, as standing will spoil them. If you bake them at home, you will find that they are generally done when they cease to make a simmering noise; and when on probing them to the bottom with a twig from a broom, or with t he blade of the knife, it comes out quite clean. The fire should then be withdrawn, and the cake allowed to get cold in the oven. Small cakes should be laid to cool on an <implement>inverted sieve.</implement> It may be recommended to novices in the art of baking, to do every thing in little tins or in very shallow pans; there being then less risk than with a large thick cake. In mixing batter that is to be baked in small cakes, use a less proportion of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p><p>Small cakes should be kept closely covered in stone jars. For large ones, you should have broad stone pans with close lids, or else tin boxes. All cakes that are made with <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> should be eaten quite fresh; so also should sponge cake. Some sorts may be kept a week; black cake much longer.</p></section>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p>TAKE one peck or two gallons of <ingredient>fine wheat flour,</ingredient> and sift it into a kneading trough, or into a small clean tub, or a large broad earthen pan; and make a deep hole in the middle of the heap of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> to begin the process by what is called setting a sponge. Have ready half a pint of <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> which in summer should be only lukewarm, but even in winter it must not be hot or boiling, and stir it well into half a pint of strong fresh <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> (if the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is home-made you must use from three quarters to a whole pint;) then pour it into the hole in the middle of the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> With a spoon work in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> round the edges of the liquid, so as to bring in by degrees sufficient <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to form a thin batter, which must be well stirred about, for a minute or two. Then take a handful of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and scatter it thinly over the top of this batter, so as to cover it entirely. Lay a warmed cloth over the whole, and set it to rise in a warm place; in winter put it nearer the fire than in summer. When the batter has risen so as to make cracks in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the top, scatter over it three or four table-spoonfuls (not more) of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> and begin to form the whole mass into a dough; commencing round the hole containing the batter, and pouring as much <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> as is necessary to make the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> mix with the batter; the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must never be more than lukewarm. When the whole is well mixed, and the original batter which is to give fermentation to the dough is completely incorporated with it, knead it hard, turning it over, pressing it, folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched hands for twenty minutes or half an hour; or till it becomes perfectly light and stiff. The goodness of

When it has been sufficiently worked, form the dough into a lump in the middle of the trough or pan, and scatter a little dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> thinly over it; then cover it, and set it again in a warm place to undergo a farther fermentation; for which, if all has been done rightly, about twenty minutes or half an hour will be sufficient.</p><p>The oven should be hot by the time the dough has remained twenty minutes in the lump.

--Having strained the morning's <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and skimmed the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> of the preceding evening, mix the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and the <ingredient>new milk</ingredient> together while the latter is quite warm, and stir in the <ingredient>rennet-water.</ingredient> When the curd has formed, you must not break it up, (as is done with other cheese,) but take it out all at once with a wooden skimming dish, and place it on a sieve to drain gradually. While it is draining, keep pressing it gently till it becomes firm and dry. Then lay a clean cloth at the bottom of a wooden <implement>cheese-hoop</implement> or mould, which should have a few small holes bored in the bottom. The cloth must be large enough for the end to turn over the top again, after the curd is put in. Place it in the <implement>press</implement> for two hours; turn it, (putting a clean cloth under it,) and press it again for six or eight hours. Then turn it again, rub the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> all over with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and return it to the <implement>press</implement> for fourteen hours. Should the edges of the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> project, they must be pared off.</p><p>When you take it finally out of the <implement>press,</implement> bind it round tightly with a cloth, (which must be changed every day when you turn the cheese,) and set it on a shelf or board.

--In buying <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> it is best to get it by the box, of an importer, that you may be sure of having it fresh, and unmixed with any that is old and of inferior quality. The box should be kept in a very dry place. If <ingredient>green tea</ingredient> is good, it will look green in the cup when poured out. <ingredient>Black tea</ingredient> should be dark coloured and have a fragrant flowery smell. The best pots for making <ingredient>tea</ingredient> are those of china. Metal and <implement>Wedgwood tea-pots</implement> by frequent use will often communicate a disagreeable taste to the <ingredient>tea.</ingredient> This disadvantage may be remedied in <implement>Wedgwood ware,</implement> by occasionally boiling the tea-pots in a vessel of <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient></p><p>In preparing to make <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> let the pot be twice scalded from the tea-kettle, which must be boiling hard at the moment the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is poured on the <ingredient>tea;</ingredient> otherwise it will be weak and insipid, even when a large quantity is put in. The best way is to have a <implement>chafing dish,</implement> with a kettle always boiling on it, in the room where the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> is made. It is a good rule to allow two tea-spoonfuls of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> to half a pint or a large cupful of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> or two tea-spoonfuls for each grown person that is to drink <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> and one spoonful extra. The pot being twice scalded, put in the <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> and pour on the <ingredient>water</ingredient> about ten minutes before you want to fill the cups, that it may have time to draw or infuse. Have <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in another pot, to weaken the cups of those that like it so. That the second course of cups may be as strong as the first, put some <ingredient>tea</ingredient> into a cup just before you sit down to table, pour on it a very little <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> (just enough to cover it,) set a saucer over it to keep in the steam, and let it infuse till you have filled all the first cups; then add it to that already in the tea-pot, and pour

<recipe class1="beverages"><p><purpose>TO MAKE COFFEE.</purpose>

--The manner in which <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is roasted is of great importance to its flavour. If roasted too little, it will be weak and insipid; if too much, the taste will be bitter and unpleasant. To have it very good, it should be roasted immediately before it is made, doing no more than the quantity you want at that time. It loses much of its strength by keeping, even in twenty-four hours after roasting. It should on no consideration be ground till directly before it is made. Every family should be provided with a <implement>coffee roaster,</implement> which is an iron cylinder to stand before the fire, and is either turned by a handle, or wound up like a jack to go of itself. If roasted in an open pot or pan, much of the flavour evaporates in the process. Before the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is put into the <implement>roaster,</implement> it should be carefully examined and picked, lest there should be stones or bad grains among it. It should be roasted of a bright brown; and will be improved by putting among it a piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> when about half done.</p><p>Watch it carefully while roasting, looking at it frequently.</p><p>A <implement>coffee-mill</implement> affixed to the wall is far more convenient than one that must be held on the lap.

Let it continue to boil hard, and as it thickens, add by degrees the other half of the <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> (that which has been put into the tub.) Stir it frequently to prevent its scorching, and to make it of equal consistence throughout. Boil it ten or twelve hours, continuing to stir it. At night take it out of the kettle, and set it in tubs to cool; covering it carefully. Wash out the kettle and wipe it very dry.</p><p>Next morning boil the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> six or eight hours longer; it should boil eighteen hours altogether. Half an hour before you take it finally out, stir in a pound of mixed <ingredient>spice;</ingredient> <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> <ingredient>allspice,</ingredient> <ingredient>cinnamon,</ingredient> and <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> all finely powdered. When entirely done, put up the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> in stone or earthen jars.

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose>TO DRY HERBS.</purpose>

--By drying <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> with artificial heat as quickly as possible, you <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> their scent and flavour much better than when they are dried slowly by exposing them to the sun and air; a process by which a large portion of their strength evaporates. All sorts of <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> are in the greatest perfection just before they begin to flower. Gather them on a dry day, and place them in an oven, which must not be hot enough to discolour, scorch, or burn them. When they are quite dry, take them out, and replace them with others. Pick the leaves from the stems, (which may be thrown away,) and put them into bottles or jars; cork them 
 
<pb n="437" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dcvb&#38;PageNum=443"/>

tightly, and keep them in a dry place. Those that are used in cookery should be kept in a kitchen closet.</p></recipe>

Then carefully put the curd (as whole as possible) into a <implement>cheese-hoop,</implement> or mould, which for this purpose should be about half a foot deep, and as large round as a dinner-plate--first spreading a clean wet cloth under the curd, and folding it (the cloth) over the top.

It must not be pressed hard, as when finished a <ingredient>cream cheese</ingredient> should be only about the consistence of firm <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The curd will sink gradually in the mould till the whole mass will be about two or three inches thick.
