<chapter class1="foodandnonfood"><pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=13"/><illustration><description>An illustration of two pots cooking over a fire in a brick fireplace.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">Grace before Meat</hd><p>"Let me cook the dinners of a nation, and I shall not care who makes its laws." Women, if they did but know it, might well thus paraphrase a famous saying. Proper dinners mean so much--good blood, good health, good judgment, good conduct. The fact makes tragic a truth too little regarded; namely, that while bad cooking can ruin the very best of raw foodstuffs, all the arts of all the cooks in the world can do no more than palliate things stale, flat and unprofitable. To buy such things is waste, instead of economy. Food must satisfy the palate else it will never truly satisfy the stomach.<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=14"/> An unsatisfied stomach, or one overworked by having to wrestle with food which has bulk out of all proportion to flavor, too often makes its vengeful protest in dyspepsia. It is said underdone mutton cost Napoleon the battle of Leipsic, and eventually his crown. I wonder, now and then, if the prevalence of divorce has any connection with the decline of home cooking?</p><p>A far cry, and heretical, do you say, gentle reader? Not so far after all--these be sociologic days. I am but leading up to the theory with facts behind it, that it was through being the best fed people in the world, we of the South Country were able to put up the best fight in history, and after the ravages and ruin of civil war, come again to our own. We might have been utterly crushed but for our proud and pampered stomachs, which in turn gave the bone, brain and brawn for the conquests of peace. So here's to our Mammys--God bless them! God rest them! This imperfect chronicle of the nurture wherewith they fed us is inscribed with love to their memory.</p><pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=15"/><p>Almost my earliest memory is of Mammy's kitchen. Permission to loiter there was a Reward of Merit--a sort of domestic Victoria Cross. If, when company came to spend the day, I made my manners prettily, I might see all the delightful hurley-burley of dinner-cooking. My seat was the biscuit block, a section of tree-trunk at least three feet across, and waist-high. Mammy set me upon it, but first covered it with her clean apron--it was almost the only use she ever made of the apron. The block stood well out of the way--next the meal barrel in the corner behind the door, and hard by the Short Shelf, sacred to cake and piemaking, as the Long Shelf beneath the window was given over to the three water buckets--cedar with brass hoops always shining like gold--the <implement>piggin,</implement> also of cedar, the <implement>corn-bread tray,</implement> and the <implement>cup-noggin.</implement> Above, the log wall bristled with knives of varying edge, stuck in the cracks; with nails whereon hung <implement>flesh-forks,</implement> spoons, ladles, <implement>skimmers.</implement> These were for the most part hand-wrought, by the local blacksmith.
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=16"/> The forks in particular were of a classic grace--so much so that when, in looking through my big sister's mythology I came upon a picture of Neptune with his trident, I called it his flesh-fork, and asked if he were about to take up meat with it, from the waves boiling about his feet.</p><p>The kitchen proper would give Domestic Science heart failure, yet it must have been altogether sanitary. Nothing about it was tight enough to harbor a self-respecting germ. It was the rise of twenty feet square, built stoutly of hewn logs, with a sharply pitched board roof, a movable loft, a plank floor boasting inch-wide cracks, a door, two windows and a fireplace that took up a full half of one end. In front of the fireplace stretched a rough stone hearth, a yard in depth. Sundry and several cranes swung against the chimney-breast. When fully in commission they held pots enough to cook for a regiment. The pots themselves, of cast iron, with close-fitting tops, ran from two to ten gallons in capacity, had rounded bottoms with<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=17"/> three pertly outstanding legs, and ears either side for the iron pot-hooks, which varied in size even as did the pots themselves.</p><p>Additionally there were ovens, deep and shallow, <implement>spiders,</implement> skillets, a couple of tea-kettles, a <implement>stew kettle,</implement> a <implement>broiler</implement> with a long <implement>spider-legged trivet</implement> to rest on, a <implement>hoe-baker,</implement> a <implement>biscuit-baker,</implement> and <implement>waffle-irons</implement> with legs like tongs. Each piece of hollow ware had its lid, with eye on top for lifting off with the hooks. Live coals, spread on hearth and lids, did the cooking. To furnish them there was a wrought iron shovel, so big and heavy nobody but Mammy herself could wield it properly. Emptied vessels were turned upside down on the floor under the Long Shelf--grease kept away rust. But before one was used it had to be scoured with soap and sand rock, rinsed and scalded. Periodically every piece was burned out--turned upside down over a roaring fire and left there until red hot, then slowly cooled. This burning out left a fine smooth surface after scouring. Cast<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=18"/> iron, being in a degree porous, necessarily took up traces of food when it had been used for cooking a month or so.</p><p>Ah me! What savors, what flavors came out of the pots! Years on years I was laughed at for maintaining that no range ever turned out things to equal open-hearth cookery. But it took paper bags to prove beyond cavil the truth of my contention. Even paper-bagging does not quite match the open-hearth process, though there is the same secret of superiority, namely, cooking things in their own essence by the agency of hot air. The sealed and loaded bag needs must be laid on a grate-shelf in a hot oven--touch of solid hot iron is fatal to it.</p><p>Iron vessels set above smoothly spread coals got hot, but not red-hot--red heat belonged to the lids. They were swung over the fire and heated before setting them in place--then the blanket of coals and embers held in heat which, radiating downward, made the cooking even. Scorching of course was possible unless the cook knew her business, and minded it<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=19"/> well. Our Mammys not only knew their business but loved it--often with a devotion that raised it to the rank of Art. Add the palate of a <emph rend="italic">gourmet</emph> born, a free hand at the fat, the sweet, strong waters and high flavors--what wonder it is to envy those of us they fed!</p><p>My individual Mammy was in figure an oblate spheroid--she stood five feet, one inch high, weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, had a head so flat buckets sat on it as of right, was as light on her feet, in number twelve shoes, as the slimmest of her children and foster children, could shame the best man on the place at lifting with the hand-stick, or chop him to a stand-still--if her axe exactly suited her. She loved her work, her mistress, her children black and white--even me, though I was something of a trial--her garden and her God. All these she served fondly, faithfully, with rare good humor and the nicest judgment. Fall soft upon her, rain and snow! Sunshine and green grass, make happy always the slope where she rests!</p><p>She put on a clean white frock every<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=20"/> morning--by breakfast time it was a sickly gray along the front--the thick of the dinner-battle was writ large on it in black smudges. She herself explained: "I ain't sech er dirty 'ooman--hit's dest I'se so big, dirt ketches me comin' and gwine." Air and more air she would have, regardless of weather. The big board-window had its shutter up all day long--the glass window was a vexation, since it opened only halfway. By way of evenning things, daubing and chinking got knocked out of at least half the cracks between the wall logs as sure as Easter came--not to be replaced until the week before Christmas. I doubt if they would have been put back even then, but that Mammy dreaded criticism, from maids and carriage drivers visiting kinfolk brought with them. Big yawning cracks in cold weather were in a way the hall-mark of poor-white cabins. It would have half broken Mammy's heart to give anybody room to say she belonged to less than real quality.</p><p>She was autocratic; a benevolent despot; withal severe. If I displeased her by<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=21"/> meddling, putting small grimy fingers into pies they should not touch, she set me to shelling black-eyed peas--a task my soul loathed, likewise the meddlesome fingers--still I knew better than to sulk or whine over it. For that I would have been sent back into the house. The kitchen stood thirty yards away from the back door, with a branchy oak in front of it, and another, even branchier, shading the log foot-way between. The house offered only grown-up talk, which rarely interested me. In the kitchen I caught scraps of Brer Rabbit's history, pithily applied, other scraps of song--Mammy always "gave out" the words to herself before singing them--proverbs and sayings such as "Cow want her tail agin in fly-time" applied to an ingrate, or: "Dat's er high kick fer er low horse," by way of setting properly in place a pretender.</p><p>Best of all, I got the latest news of the countryside for ten miles around. Wireless has little on the way things ran about among the plantations. It was a point of honor among the black men to have wives<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=22"/> or sweethearts away from home. This meant running about nightly--consequently cross-currents of gossip lively enough to make the yellowest journal turn green with envy. Mammy was a trifle apologetic over having a husband no further off than the next neighbor's. To make up for it, however, the husbands who came to his house lived from three to five miles away--and one of them worked at the mill, hence was a veritable human chronicle. Thus Mammy was able to hold her head up with Susan, her sister, who milked and washed.</p><p>Susan might have been called a widow of degrees--she had had three husbands, but only two were living. The last parting was always threatening to end in meeting over again--still that did not hinder her cabin from being the 
rendezvous of all the likeliest fellows within easy walking range 
. Naturally she had things to tell--worth hearing whether or no they were true. So also had Phoebe, who was a sort of scullion, fetching in wood and water, gathering vegetables, picking chickens,<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=23"/> scouring all things from the big pot to the floor. Shelves were scoured daily, the floor three times a week. This had to be a matter of faith after an hour or so--it certainly did not look it. Sweeping, done three times a day, was largely a matter of form. Phoebe went conscientiously over the uncluttered spaces, and even reached the nose of her broom between pots and ovens, but only coarse trash gathered before the broom--all the rest went through the cracks.</p><p>Mammy said Phoebe's news could be believed. "De gal don't know no mo'n ter tell dest whut she done heard." She truly was slow-witted and slow-spoken, but Isham, her step-father, was cook to the Gresham brothers, the beaux of the neighborhood, who kept bachelor's hall. His mother had been their Mammy--hence his inherited privilege of knowing rather more about his young masters than they knew themselves.</p><p>Little pitchers have big ears. Set it to the credit of the black folk, they always had regard for the innocence of childhood.<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=24"/> Scandal was merely breathed--not even so hinted as to arouse curiosity. Foul speech I never heard from them nor a trace of profanity. What I did hear was a liberal education in the humanities--as time passes I rate more and more highly the sense of values it fixed in a plastic mind. I think it must have been because our Mammys saw all things from the elemental angle, they were critics so illuminating of manners and morals.</p><p>Here ends reminiscence, set down in hope it may breed understanding. All I actually learned from Mammy and her cooking was--how things ought to taste. The which is essential. It has been the pole-star of my career as a cook. Followed faithfully along the Way of Many Failures, through a Country of Tribulations, it has brought me into the haven of knowledge absolute. If the testimony of empty plates and smiling guests can establish a fact, then I am a good cook--though limited. I profess only to cook the things I care to cook well. Hence I have set my hand to this, a real cook's book. Most cook books<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=25"/> are written by folk who cook by hearsay--it is the fewest number of real cooks who can write so as not to bewilder the common or garden variety of mind. The bulk of what follows has an old-time Southern foundation, with such frillings as experience approves. To it there will be added somewhat of Creole cookery, learned and proved here in New York town by grace of Milly, the very queen of New Orleans cooks, temporarily transplanted. Also sundry and several delectable dishes of alien origins--some as made in France or Germany, some from the far Philippines, but all proved before record. In each case the source is indicated in the title. Things my very own, evolved from my inner consciousness, my outer opportunity and environment, I shall likewise mark personal.</p><p>Lastly, but far from leastly, let me make protest against over-elaboration, alike in food and the serving thereof. The very best decoration for a table is something good in the plates. This is not saying one should not plan to please the eye no less than the palate. But ribbon on sandwiches<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=26"/> is an anachronism--so is all the flummery of silk and laces, doilies and doo-dads that so often bewilder us. They are unfair to the food--as hard to live up to as anybody's blue china. I smile even yet, remembering my husband's chuckles, after we had come home from eating delicatessen chicken off ten-dollar plates, by help of antique silver. Somehow the viands and the service seemed "out of drawing."</p><p>Quoth Heine the cynic: "Woman, woman! Much must be forgiven thee! Thou hast loved much--and many." Edibly I love much rather than many. Enough of one thoroughly good thing, with proper accessories, is more satisfying than seven courses--each worse than the last. Also cheaper, also much less trouble. If time has any value, the economy of it in dishwashing alone is worth considering. In these piping days of rising prices, economy sounds good, even in the abstract. Add the concrete fact that you save money as well as trouble, and the world of cooks may well sit up and take notice.</p><p>The one-piece dinner is as convenient and<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=27"/> comfortable as the one-piece frock. There are, of course, occasions to which it is unsuited. One-piece must be understood to mean the <emph rend="italic">pi&#232;ce de resistance</emph>--the backbone of subsistence as it were. A bowl of rich soup or chowder, with crackers on the side, a generous helping of well-cooked meat, with bread or potatoes, and the simplest relishes, or a royally fat pudding overrun with brandy sauce; each or either can put it all over a splash of this, a dab of that, a slab of something else, set lonesomely on a separate plate and reckoned a meal--in courses. Courses are all well enough--they have my warm heart when they come "in the picture." But when they are mostly "The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen," then I would trade them, and gladly, for as much good bread and butter as appetite called for.</p><p>By way of postscript: being a strict and ardent advocate of temperance, I refused to consider writing this book unless I had full liberty to advise the use of wine, brandy, cordials, liquors, where good cooking<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=28"/> demands them. Any earthly thing can be abused--to teach right use is the best preventive of abuse. Liquors, like everything else, must be good. "Cooking sherry" is as much an abomination as "cooking butter," or "cooking apples." You will never get out of pot or pan anything fundamentally better than what went into it. Cooking is not alchemy; there is no magic in the pot. The whole art and mystery of it is to apply heat and seasoning in such fashion as to make the best, and the most, of such food supplies as your purse permits. Tough meat cannot be cooked tender; tainted meat cannot be cooked sound. It is the same with stale fish, specked or soured fruit, withered vegetables. It pays to educate tradesfolk into understanding that you want the best and only the best of what you buy. If the thing you want, in perfect condition, is beyond your means, take, instead of a lower grade of it, the highest grade of something cheaper. So shall you escape waste of time, effort and substance. Never mind sneers at your simple fare. Remember it<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=29"/> was Solomon the Wise who wrote: "Better a dinner of herbs and contentment than a stalled ox, and contention therewith." Paraphrase the last clause into "spoiled ox and ptomaines therewith," and you may keep not only self-respect, but that of the neighbors.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="breadsweets"><pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=30"/><illustration><description>A table set with various baked goods, including a partially sliced loaf of bread, a pie, and a plate of cookies.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">The Staff of Life</hd><p>Bread, more than almost any other foodstuff, can not be better than what it is made of. Here as elsewhere a bungler can ruin the very best of flour or meal. But the queen of cooks can not make good a fundamental deficiency.</p><p>Hence in buying flour look for these things: a slightly creamy cast--dazzling whiteness shows bleaching, as a gray-white, or black specks mean grinding from spoiled grain. The feel should be velvety, with no trace of roughness--roughness means, commonly, mixture with corn. A handful tightly gripped should keep the shape of the hand, and show to a degree<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=31"/> the markings of the palm. A pinch wet rather stiff, and stretched between thumb and finger, will show by the length of the thread it spins richness or poverty in gluten--one of the most valuable food elements.</p><p>The cornmeal of commerce will not be satisfactory in any receipt here given. It has been bolted and kiln-dried out of all natural flavor. Take the trouble to get meal water-ground, from white flint corn, and fresh from the mill. Then you will have something worth spending time and effort upon--spending them hopefully. Why, the wisest man can not tell--but steam-ground meal is of a flavor wholly unlike that water-ground. The grinding should be neither too fine nor too coarse. Bran left in, and sifted out as needed, helps to save from musting, and to preserve the delicate natural flavor. Fresh meal, in clean bright tin or glass, or in a stout paper sack, where it is dry, cool and airy will keep two months. Hence buy it judiciously, in proportion to your family's corn-cake appetite.</p><pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=32"/><p>It is impossible to give exactly the amount of liquid for any sort of bread-making because the condition of flour and meal varies with weather and keeping. This applies also to sugar--hence the need for intelligence in the use of receipts. In damp muggy weather moisture is absorbed from the atmosphere. Upon a dry day especially if there is much wind, drying out is inevitable. Anything that feels clammy, or that clots, should be dried in a warm, not hot, oven. Heating flour before mixing it, taking care not to scorch it in the least, is one small secret of light bread, biscuit and cake. Flour in a bag may be laid in the sun with advantage. Use judgment in mixing. Note the appearance of what you are making closely--when it turns out extra good, set up that first condition as a standard.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose rend="italic">Beaten Biscuit:</purpose>
(Old Style.) Sift a quart of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a bowl or tray, add half a teaspoon <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then cut small into it a teacup of very <ingredient>cold lard.</ingredient> Wet with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--<ingredient>ice water</ingredient> is best--into a very stiff<pb n="29" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=33"/> dough. Lay on a floured block, or marble slab, and give one hundred strokes with a mallet or rolling pin. Fold afresh as the dough beats thin, dredging in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> if it begins to stick. The end of beating is to distribute air well through the mass, which, expanding by the heat of baking, makes the biscuit light. The dough should be firm, but smooth and very elastic. Roll to half-inch thickness, cut out with a small <implement>round cutter,</implement> prick lightly all over the top, and bake in steady heat to a delicate brown. Too hot an oven will scorch and blister, too cold an one make the biscuit hard and clammy. Aim for the Irishman's "middle exthrame."</p></recipe>
<p>There are sundry machines which do away with beating. It is possible also to avoid it by running the dough, after mixing, several times through a <implement>food-chopper.</implement> Also beaten biscuit can be closely imitated by making good puff paste, rolling, cutting out, pricking and baking--but rather more quickly than the real thing. All these are expedients for those who live in apartments, where the noise of beating might<pb n="30" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=34"/> be held against good neighborhood. Householders, and especially suburban ones, should indulge in the luxury of a block or stone or marble slab--and live happy ever after, if they can but get cooks able and willing to make proper use of it.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose rend="italic">Soda Biscuit:</purpose>
(Old Style.)

<chapter class1="meatfishgame"><pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=43"/><illustration><description>An illustration of joints of meat being cured in a smokehouse.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">Saving Your Bacon</hd><p>Plenty in the smokehouse was the cornerstone of the old time southern cookery. Hence hog-killing was a festival as joyous as Christmas--and little less sacred. There was keen rivalry amongst plantations as to which should show the finest pen of fattening hogs. Though the plantation force was commonly amply sufficient for the work of slaughter, owners indulged their slaves by asking help of each other--of course returning the favor at need.</p><p>A far cry from a cook book, common or garden variety. Here, it is worth its space, as explaining in a measure what follows.<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=44"/> Namely full direction for choosing your fatted pig, cutting him up, and making the most of the ultimate results. Choose carcasses between a hundred and seventy-five and a hundred and fifty pounds in weight, of a fresh pinky white hue, free of cuts, scratches, or bruises, the skin scraped clean, and firm, not slimy, to touch, the fat firm and white, the lean a lively purplish pink. Two inches of clear fat over the backbone, and the thick of the ribs should be the limit. Anything more is wasteful--unless there is a great need of lard in the kitchen. The pig should be chilled throughout, but not frozen--freezing injures flavor and texture somewhat, besides preventing the proper quick striking in of salt.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>Curing space permitting, it is wise to cut up several 
 
<purpose><alt synonym1="bacon" synonym2="ham">pigs</alt></purpose>
at once. The trouble is hardly increased, and the results, especially in saving, very much greater. The head will have been at least half severed in slaughtering. With a very sharp <implement>butcher knife,</implement> after the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> is laid on the chopping block, cut deeply through the<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=45"/> skin, all round, then with a blow or two of the axe sever the head. Next cut through the skin deeply, either side of the back bone. The cuts should be evenly parallel, and about two inches apart. Now turn the <ingredient>pig</ingredient> on his back, part the legs and with the <implement>meat axe</implement> chop through the ribs, and joints. After chopping, cut the backbone free with the knife, trim off the strip of fat for the lard pile, chop the backbone itself into pieces three to four inches long, until the chine is reached--the part betwixt the shoulder blades with the high spinal processes. Leave the chine intact for smoking, along with the jowls and sausage.</p><p>Pull out the leaf-fat--it grows around and over the kidneys. Also pull out the spare ribs, leaving only one or two in the shoulders. This done, chop off feet, then with the knife cut hams and shoulders free from the sides. Trim after cutting out, saving all trimmings for sausage. Save every bit of pure fat for lard. Also cut away the clear fat at the top of the sides, devoting it to the same use. Make clean cuts on the joints--this means a knife often<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=46"/> whetted. Trim the hams rather flat, and shape the hip bone neatly. The commercial fashion of cutting away all the upper half of hams is fatal to perfect flavor. Trim shoulders close, unless they are destined to be made into sausage--in that case put them with the other scraps. Sides can either be cut into strips four to five inches wide the long way, after the manner of commercial "breakfast bacon," or left whole throughout their streaky part, cutting away solid fat along the top for lard. Separate the heads at the jaw, leaving the tongue attached to the jowl, and taking care not to cut it. Cut off the snout two inches above the tip, then lay the upper part of the head, skin down, crack the inner bone with the axe, press the broken bones apart, and take out the brains. Jowls are to be salted and smoked--heads are best either simply corned for boiling with cabbage, peas, beans, etc., or made in conjunction with the feet into head-cheese, whose south country name is souse.</p><p>Use regular <ingredient>pickling salt</ingredient>--coarse-grained and lively. Spread it an inch<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=47"/> thick upon clean wood--a broad shelf, box bottom, or something similar. Rub the meat well over with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and then lay it neatly, skin-side down, upon the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> layer, spread more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on top, and put on another layer of meat. Put sides together, likewise hams and shoulders. Pack as close as possible and fill all crevices with <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> alone will save your bacon, but a teacup of <ingredient>moist sugar</ingredient> well mixed through a water-bucket of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> improves the flavor. Use this on sides, jowls and chines. The joints, hams and shoulders, especially if the shoulders are close-cut, need a trifle more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> in the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> also a trifle of saltpeter--say an ounce in fine powder to three gallons of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Rub the skin-sides over with plain <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and lay upon the salt-covered shelf the same as sides. Then take a handful of the mixture and rub it in hard around the bone, then cover the whole cut surface half an inch thick, spread on dry <ingredient>salt</ingredient> for another layer of hams or shoulders, and repeat. Salt the chines lightly--their surface, cut all over, takes up too much <ingredient>salt</ingredient> if permitted. There should be holes<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=48"/> or cracks in the bottom to let the dissolved <ingredient>salt</ingredient> drip away; it is best also to have it a foot at least above the floor.</p><p>Cover the meat thus in bulk, but not too close, and leave standing a fortnight. The cooler and airier the place it stands in the better--freezing even is not objectionable when the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> begins striking in. But with freezing weather the meat must lie longer in <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Overhaul it after the first fortnight--that is to say break up the bulk, shake away bloody <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> sweep the bottom clean, and put on fresh <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> But use very little saltpeter on the joints this time--on pain of making them too hard as to their lean. Its use is to give firmness and a handsome clear red color--an overdose of it produces a faintly undesirable flavor. Some famous ham makers, at this second salting, rub the cut sides over lightly with very good <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and sprinkle on <ingredient>ground black pepper,</ingredient> before adding new <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Others rub in a teaspoonful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> mixed with pounded <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> around the bone. But very excellent hams can be made without such excess of painstaking.</p><pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=49"/><p>Let the meat lie two to four weeks after overhauling, according to the weather. Take up, wipe all over with coarse clean cloth, furnish each piece with a loop of stout twine at least four inches long, and so run through the flesh, tearing out is impossible. Run through the hock of hams, the upper tip of shoulders, the thickest part of sides, the pointed tip of jowls. Jowls may not need to lie so long as bigger pieces, especially if part of their fat has gone to lard. Chines can be hung up in three weeks, and cured with a very light smoking, along with the bags of sausage.</p><p>Hang hams highest, shoulders next, then sides, jowls, etc. Leave to drip forty-eight hours unless the weather turns suddenly warm, damp and muggy--in that case start the smoking after a few hours. Smoke from green hickory, sound and bright, is needed for the finest flavor. Lay small logs so they will hug together as they burn, kindle fire along the whole length of them, then smother it with damp, small chips, trash, bark and so on, but take care to have everything sound. Rotten<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=50"/> wood, or that which is water-logged or mildewed, makes rank, ill-smelling smoke. Take greater care that the logs never blaze up, also that the meat is high enough to escape fire-heating. Once it gets hot from the fire all your trouble will have been for naught--though it will not be tainted it will have the same taste and smell--the degree marking the extent of the heating.</p></recipe>
<p>Old southern smokehouses had for the most part earthen floors, trenched to make the smoke fires safe. Some had puncheon floors, with an earthen hearth in the middle, whereupon was placed a furnace of loose brick--that could be kicked over at need, smothering an outbreaking fire. Still others had big cast iron kettles sunk in a sort of well in the floor--with a handy water bucket for quenching fires. Whatever the floor, eternal vigilance was the price of safe bacon--you looked at the smokehouse fires first thing in the morning and last at night. They were put out at sundown, but had a knack of burning again from some hidden seed of live coal. Morning smoke could not well be too thick,<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=51"/> provided it smelled right--keen and clean, reminiscent of sylvan fragrance--a thick, acrid smoke that set you sneezing and coughing, was "most tolerable and not to be endured." It was not well to leave the smoke too thick at night--somehow the chill then condensed it. A thin, blue, hot-scented but cool, vapor was the thing to strive for then. There were folk who suggested furnaces--with smoke pipes leading in--ever so much safer they said, withal much less trouble. Why! even the smoke from a cooking stove might be made to answer. But these progressives were heard coldly--the old timers knew in right of tradition and experience, the need of well ventilated smoke.</p><p>It gave this present chronicler a feeling of getting home again, to walk through the curing rooms of perhaps the most famous bacon makers in the world, and find them practicing the wisdom of her childhood. Namely using hickory smoke not delivered from furnace pipes but welling up, up, in beautiful wreathy spirals, to reach row on row of hams and flitches--and to be told,<pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=52"/> by a kind person who did not know she already knew, that their curing was patterned on the old English model--curing in the smoke of great-throated stone hall chimneys. Yes--they had tried pipes--furnaces likewise--but they gave too much heat, did not distribute smoke evenly, besides being almost impossible of regulation. Hence the smoldering hickory that was like a breath from a far past.</p><p>Notwithstanding, the chronicler is of opinion that folk who would like to try their hands at bacon making may do it with a fair hope without building regular smoke houses. To such she would say, get a stout <implement>hogshead</implement>--a <implement>sugar hogshead</implement> preferable--nail on a board roof to shed water, then set it upon a stout frame at least seven feet above ground. Nail inside it stout cleats, to hold the cross bars for the meat. Hang the meat upon them--but not until the <implement>hogshead</implement> is in place. Cut a hole in the bottom as big as the top of a large barrel. Working through this hole, arrange the meat, then put below a headless barrel, the top resting against the hogshead-<pb n="49" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=53"/>
heading, the bottom upon supports of gas pipe, iron, or even piled bricks. Between the supports set an iron vessel--build your hickory smoke-fires in it, smothering them carefully, and letting the smoke, with a sufficiency of air, well up, through barrel, <implement>hogshead,</implement> etc. Or one might even rig up a <implement>smoking hogshead</implement> in an attic, providing the chimney were tall enough to cool smoke properly--and lead smoke out to it through a length of drain pipe.</p><p>These are but suggestions--the contriving mind will doubtless invent other and better ones. Smoking must go on for five weeks at least. Six will be better, slacking toward the end. But two may be made to answer by the use of what is called "liquid smoke" whose other name is crude pyroligneous acid. A product of wood distillation, it has been proved harmless in use, but use is nevertheless forbidden to commercial makers. The meat, after breaking bulk, is dipped in it three times at fairly brief intervals, hung up, drained, and smoked. From the liquid smoke it will have acquired as much acid saving-<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=54"/> grace, as from four weeks of old fashioned smoking.</p><p>A smokehouse needs to be kept dark, dry, and cool, also well ventilated. Use fine screen wire over all openings, and make windows very small, with coarse, sleazy crash in the sash rather than glass inside the screens. Darkness prevents or discourages the maggot-fly. To discourage him still further cover the cut sides of hams and shoulders before hanging up with molasses made very thick with ground black pepper. They will not absolutely require canvassing and dipping in whitewash after if the peppering is thorough. But to be on the safe side--canvas and dip. Make the whitewash with a foundation of thick paste--and be sure it covers every thread of the canvas. Hams perfectly cured and canvassed keep indefinitely in the right sort of smokehouse--but there is not much gain in flavor after they are three years old.</p>

<p>No doubt we were foolish--but somehow the regular "cases" made our sausages unappetizing if we put it into them for keeping. Further the "Tom Thumbs" were in great request for chitterlings--I never saw them served to white folks but have smelled their savoriness in the cabins. That is, however, beside the mark. We saved our sausage against the spring scarcity in several ways. One was to fry it in quantity, pack the cakes as fried in <implement>crocks,</implement> pour over them the gravy, and when the jar was almost full, cover the top an inch deep with melted lard. Kept cool and dark the cakes came out as good as they went in. Still there were palates that craved smoked sausage. To satisfy them, some folk tied up the meat in links of clean corn husks, and hung them at the side where the smoke barely touched them. Another way was to make small bags of stout unbleached muslin, fill, tie close, dip the bag in melted grease, cool and smoke. The dipping was not really essential--still<pb n="58" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=62"/> it kept the sausage a little fresher.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>The proper boiling of a proper 
 
<purpose><alt synonym1="boiled ham">ham</alt></purpose>
reaches the level of high art. Proper boiling makes any sound <ingredient>ham</ingredient> tolerable eating; conversely a crass and hasty cook can spoil utterly this crowning mercy of the smokehouse. Yet proper cooking is not a recondite process, nor one beyond the simplest intelligence. It means first and most, pains and patience, with somewhat of foresight, and something more of judgment.</p><p>Cut off the hock, but not too high--barely the slender shankbone. Then go all over the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> with a dull knife, scraping off every bit of removable grease or soilure.<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=64"/> Wipe afterward with a coarse, damp cloth, then lay in a dishpan and cover an inch deep with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> If the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is very hard soften by adding a tiny pinch of <ingredient>baking soda.</ingredient> Leave in soak all night. In the morning wash well all over, using your coarse cloth, and a little scouring soap, then rinse well in <ingredient>tepid water,</ingredient> followed by a second rinsing in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> drain, and wipe dry. A flat-bottomed <implement>boiler</implement> is best--with one rounding, there is greater risk of scorching. Set a rack on the bottom else an old dish or earthen pieplate, pour in an inch of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> set over the fire, lay the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> upon the rack, skin side down, and fill up with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> till it stands two inches above the meat. Take care in adding the <ingredient>water</ingredient> not to dislodge the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> from the rack. Bring the <ingredient>water</ingredient> to a boil, throw in a pint of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and skim the <implement>boiler</implement> very clean, going over it twice or three times. After the last skimming add half a dozen whole <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> a dozen whole <ingredient>alspice,</ingredient> a pod of <ingredient>red pepper,</ingredient> a few whole grains of <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> and if you like, a young <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or a stalk of <ingredient>celery.</ingredient> Personally<pb n="61" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=65"/> I do not like either <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or <ingredient>celery</ingredient>--moreover they taint the fat one may save from the pot. Let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boil hard for half a minute, no longer, then slack heat till it barely simmers. Keep it simmering, filling up the pot as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in it boils away, until the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> is tender throughout. The time depends on several things--the hardness and age of the <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> weight, curing. Fifteen minutes to the pound, reckoned from the beginning of simmering, is the standard allowance. I have no hard and fast rule--my <ingredient>hams</ingredient> boil always until the fork pierces them readily, and the hipbone stands clear of flesh.</p><p>A big <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> fifteen to twenty pounds weight, had better be left in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> overnight. A smaller one, say of ten pounds weight, should remain only until thoroughly cold. Take up carefully when cold, let drain twenty minutes, lying flesh side up in a flat dish, then trim off the under side and edges neatly, removing rusty fat, strings, etc., and cutting through the skin at the hock end. Turn over and remove the skin--taking care not to tear<pb n="62" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=66"/> away too much fat with it. Remove the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> to a clean, deep dish, or bowl--the closer fitting the better, then pour around it either sound <ingredient>claret,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet cider,</ingredient> till it stands half way up the sides. Add a little <ingredient>tabasco</ingredient> or <ingredient>Worcester</ingredient> to the liquor, if high flavors are approved. Then stick whole <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> in a lozenge pattern all over the fat, sprinkle on thickly <ingredient>red and black pepper,</ingredient> and last of all, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>--<ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> if to be had, but white will do.</p><p>Leave standing several hours, basting once or twice with the liquor in the bowl. Take out, set on a rack in an <implement>agate pan,</implement> pour the liquor underneath, and bake slowly one to two hours, according to size. Baste every fifteen minutes, adding <ingredient>water</ingredient> as the liquor cooks away. Beware scorching--the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> should be a beautiful speckly dark brown all over. Let cool uncovered, and keep cool, but not on ice until eaten.</p><p>Drop a lump of <ingredient>ice</ingredient> in the boiling liquor unless the weather is cold--then set it outside. As soon as the fat on top hardens take it off, boil it fifteen minutes in clear <ingredient>water,</ingredient> chill, skim off, and clarify by<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=67"/> frying slices of raw <ingredient>potato</ingredient> in it. The spices will have sunk to the bottom, and there will be no trace of their flavor in the fat. Any boiling vegetable--cabbage, string beans, navy beans, greens in general--may be cooked to advantage in the liquor. It also serves as an excellent foundation for pea soup. Drain it off from the sediment, reduce a trifle by quick boiling, then add the other things. Dumplings of sound cornmeal, wet up stiff, shaped the size of an egg, and dropped in the boiling liquor, furnish a luncheon dish cheap and appetizing.</p></recipe>

<p>Tart apples cored but not peeled sliced in rings and fried in hot fat, drained out and sprinkled lightly with sugar, add to the charm of even the finest ham. So does hominy, the full-grained sort, boiled tender beforehand, and fried till there is a thick, brown crust all over the skillet bottom. The secret of these as of all other fryings, is to have grease enough, make it hot enough to crisp whatever goes into it instantly, then to watch so there shall be no scorching, and take out what is fried as soon as done, draining well. Among the paradoxes of cookery is this--frying with scant grease makes greasy<pb n="66" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=70"/> eating, whereas frying in deep fat, sufficiently hot, makes the reverse.</p>

Set the goblets in the tray, then fill up with <ingredient>whiskey</ingredient> or <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> or both, mixed--the mixture is best with brands that blend smoothly. Drop in the middle a fresh ripe <ingredient>strawberry,</ingredient> or <ingredient>cherry,</ingredient> or slice of <ingredient>red peach,</ingredient> and serve at once. Fruit can be left out without harm to flavor--it is mainly for the satisfaction of the eye. But never by any chance bruise the <ingredient>mint</ingredient>--it will give an acrid flavor "most tolerable and not to be endured." To get the real old-time effect, serve with spoons in the goblets rather than straws.

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><pb n="90" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=94"/><illustration><description>A table covered with finished pies and various cooking implements, including a sifter, mixing bowl, and rolling pin.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">Paste, Pies, Puddings</hd><p><emph rend="italic">The Philosophy of Pie Crust:</emph> Pie-crust perfection depends on several things--good flour, good fat, good handling, most especially good baking. A hot oven, quick but not scorching, expands the air betwixt layers of paste, and pops open the flour-grains, making them absorb the fat as it melts, thereby growing crisp and relishful instead of hard and tough. The lighter and drier the flour the better--in very damp weather it is best oven-dried, then cooled before mixing. Shortening, whether lard, butter, or clarified drippings, should be very cold--unless your recipe demands that it be softened or melted. Milk or<pb n="91" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=95"/> water used in mixing ought to be likewise well chilled, unless the shortening is soft--in that case match its temperature. The regular rule is half-pint ice water to the pound of flour, using chilled shortening. If the fat is semi-fluid the paste must be mixed softer, using say, three parts of a pint to the pound.</p><p>Baking powder or soda and cream tartar, or soda alone with sour cream or buttermilk for wetting, makes crust light and short with less butter, therefore is an economy. Genuine puff paste is requisite for the finest tarts, pies, etc., etc., but light short crust answers admirably for most things. Sift flour twice or even thrice for any sort of paste. Sift soda or baking powder well through it, but not salt. Make the salt fine, drop in the bottom of the mixing bowl, before the last sifting, and mix lightly through the flour before adding the shortening. Rub in shortening very lightly, using only the finger-tips--the palms melt or soften it. Add milk or water, a little at a time, mixing it in with a broad-bladed knife rather than the<pb n="92" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=96"/> hands. Mix lightly--so the paste barely sticks together. Put in first one-third of the shortening--this, of course, for puff paste. Half a pound of butter or lard to the pound of flour makes a very good paste, but to have it in full richness, use three-quarters of a pound. Wash butter well to remove the salt, and squeeze out water by wringing it in a well-floured cloth. If there is a strong taste, or any trace of rancidity, wash well, kneading through and through, in sweet milk, then rinse out the milk with cold water to which a little borax has been added. Rinse again in clear cold water--this should remove ill-flavor without injury to anybody's stomach. But be very sure the last rinsing is thorough--borax, though wholly harmless, adds nothing to digestibility.</p><p>The end of the repeated rollings out and foldings demanded by real puff paste is to enclose between the layers of paste as much air as possible. Hence the chillings between rollings. Hence also the need of pinching edges well together after foldings,<pb n="93" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=97"/> and rolling always <emph rend="italic">from</emph> you, never back and forth. Roll out paste into a long narrow strip after the first mixing, divide the remaining shortening into three equal portions, keep very cold, and as needed cut into small bits, which spread evenly on top of the rolled paste, which must be lightly dredged with flour. Fold in three evenly, one thickness on another, turn so the folded edges may be to right and left while rolling, pinch the other edges well together and roll again into a long strip, moving the rolling-pin always from you. Repeat until all the butter is used, then set on ice for an hour to harden. In baking beware opening the oven door until the paste has risen fully and becomes slightly crusted over.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose>Baking powder crust</purpose>
must not stand--the gas which aerates it begins forming and escaping the minute it is wet up. It also requires a hot oven and delicate handling.

Beat until very light the <ingredient>yolks of twelve eggs</ingredient> with a pound of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> add to them a tablespoonful <ingredient>corn starch,</ingredient> then three-quarters of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> washed and creamed. Add also the<pb n="102" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=106"/> strained <ingredient>juice of two lemons,</ingredient> a teaspoonful <ingredient>lemon essence</ingredient> and a teaspoonful <ingredient>vanilla.</ingredient> Set over <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and stir until all ingredients blend--only thus can you dissolve <ingredient>granulated sugar,</ingredient> which is best to use, lacking the old-fashioned live open-kettle brown. Keep over the <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> stirring well together as you fill the <ingredient>tart</ingredient> shells. They must be lined with real <ingredient>puff paste,</ingredient> rolled very thin, and nicely fitted. Set in broad shallow pans, after filling with the batter and bake in a quick, but not scorching oven. A blanched <ingredient>almond,</ingredient> or bit of <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> or half a <ingredient>pecan</ingredient> or <ingredient>walnut meat,</ingredient> may be put in each shell before filling. I prefer though to add such frills by help of the frosting.

Tiny <ingredient>pink or green comfits</ingredient> stuck in the middle, or set in threes triangularly, are very decorative. Indeed, there is no limit but taste and invention to the manners of making beautiful these tarts. I rather pride myself upon them, since they have been enthusiastically praised by folk who have eaten all around the world, and set above the best of French confections by a man ten years resident in Paris, whose wife is held to be the most skilled amateur cook in New York.</p><p><variation>Grated <ingredient>cocoanut</ingredient> or raw grated <ingredient>apple</ingredient> stirred into the batter before baking, varies the cheese cakes--and to some palates improves it.

Milly was the exception, proving the rule. Bred in New Orleans, steeped in its atmosphere, its traditions, a cook of degree, and daughter of a cook to whom, though past middle age, she paid the most reverent homage, she yet kept her magic touch amid the crush and hurly-burly of New York town, albeit she never grew acclimated nor even content. This in spite of a mistress she adored--in virtue of having served her ten years down in the home city. When at last Milly went back to her own, there was wailing amongst all of us, who had eaten her cooking,<pb n="119" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=123"/> but the mistress smiled, rather sadly, to be sure, saying: "I could not beg her to stay--she was so unhappy here."</p><p>Milly never had quite a free hand--New York markets know not many things familiar to those of the Crescent City. Notwithstanding, she was a liberal education in blended flavors, in the delights, the surprises of the Creole kitchen. Tall and slim, of a golden-brown complexion, neat to the point of austerity, trim and self-contained, sight of her somehow gave an added piquancy to her dishes. She did not make friends readily, but the comradery of cooking induced her to more than tolerate me. "I don't say I kin cook--but my mother can," she often told me--smiling proudly the while, with the buzzing praises of <emph rend="italic">gourmets</emph> sounding in her ears. She could never tell you how she made her ambrosial dishes--but if you had my luck to be <emph rend="italic">persona gratis</emph> she could and did show you, to the queen's taste.</p><p>I shall write only whereof I know--not by any means a compend of Creole cookery. Indeed, a lifetime is hardly enough<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=124"/> to eat of all its specially excellent dishes. It seems to me from this scant experience, one general principle runs through all. It is the blending of proportioned flavors, achieved through long and gentle cooking. Milly said she let things "sob," a mistake I dare say, for the old-time "sod," past participle of "seethe." But I by no means speak with authority--my deduction is from the premise of fifty dinners, each it seemed to me uniquely excellent. After this prelude come we to specific recipes.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south" ethnicgroup="creole"><p><purpose rend="italic">Bouillabaisse:</purpose>
While time endures New Orleans will plume itself upon this dish which drew from Thackeray a world-famous tribute. "In New Orleans you can eat a Bouillabaisse, the like of which was never eaten in Marseilles or Paris." Which is much, very much, from the laureate of Bouillabaisse, as native to Marseilles. The reason of superiority is not far to seek--it lies in the excellence and flavor of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> native to the Gulf of Mexico. Lacking <ingredient>Pompano,</ingredient> <ingredient>Red Snapper,</ingredient> and <ingredient>Redfish,</ingredient> even Milly could not quite do her knowledge justice. But she made shift with what the market offered, choosing generally <ingredient>halibut,</ingredient> with fresh <ingredient>cod,</ingredient> or <ingredient>bluefish,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sea trout.</ingredient> Two kinds of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in equal quantity are imperative. The better, finer and firmer the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> the better<pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=127"/> the Bouillabaisse. Cut each sort in six equal slices, saving trimmings, heads, etc. Boil them in three pints of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with a sliced <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> and a bouquet of <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> until reduced to one pint. Remove fish-heads and <ingredient>herbs,</ingredient> then strain the stock, and set aside until needed. Meantime rub the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> over very well with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> then with a mixture made by mincing very fine three <ingredient>bay leaves,</ingredient> three sprigs each of <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> three cloves of <ingredient>garlic,</ingredient> and six <ingredient>allspice</ingredient> pounded to powder. Rub the mixture in well and thoroughly--here is the key to success. The seasoning must go through and through the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> Put into a very wide pan, two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>olive oil,</ingredient> heat it gently, add two mild <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> chopped and let them cook a little without browning. Now lay in the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> slice by slice, so one slice does not touch another, cover the pan, and let the slices smother for about ten minutes, turning them once, so as to cook each side partly. Take up, lay separately in a large dish, pour half a bottle of <ingredient>white wine</ingredient> into the pan, and stir hard. Add six large, fresh<pb n="124" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=128"/><ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> sliced very thin, let boil a few minutes, then half a <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> also in very thin slices, and a pint of the <ingredient>fish stock</ingredient> strained. Season well, with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and <ingredient>Cayenne</ingredient>--here the palate is guide. Boil all together until reduced almost one half, then lay in the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> slices, taking care they do not touch, and boil briskly for five minutes. While the boiling goes on, chop fine a pinch of <ingredient>saffron,</ingredient> put it in a small, deep dish, and mix smooth with a spoonful of the boiling liquor. Dissolve the <ingredient>saffron</ingredient> very well, and when the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> has cooked its allotted five minutes, spread the <ingredient>saffron</ingredient> on top of the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> Fry in <ingredient>butter</ingredient> as many slices of <ingredient>toast</ingredient> as you have slices of <ingredient>fish</ingredient>--lay the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> on the toast, pour the sauce over it, and serve immediately, very hot.</p></recipe>

Always put a pinch of fine salt in the bottom of the mixing bowl, which ought to be freshly scalded and wiped very dry. A damp bowl clogs with either sugar or flour, making the stirring much harder. Unless specifically directed otherwise, separate the eggs, set the whites on ice till time to whip them, beat the yolks very, very light--to a pale, frothy yellow, add the sugar, free of lumps, a cupful at a time, then the butter washed and beaten to a<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=142"/> creamy froth, beat hard together for five minutes, then add alternately the flour and the egg-whites beaten to the stiffest possible froth. Add a pinch of salt as beating begins, and if the egg supply is scant, a teaspoonful of cold water to each white. This will increase the quantity, and help to make the cake lighter, as it is the air-bubbles imprisoned in the froth which give it its raising virtue. Add fruit and flavoring last thing. Fruit should be well floured but never clotted. If batter appears to be too stiff a little whiskey thins it excellently, and helps to make it lighter. Put in two tablespoonfuls to six eggs, using more in proportion. Rose water or a liqueur have the same effect but give their own flavor--which whiskey does not.</p><p>If strong butter needs must be used, it can be mitigated to a degree, by washing and kneading well in cold water barely dashed with chloride of lime solution, then rinsing well in cold water, and afterward in sweet milk. The milk may be half water. Rinse it out clean. Let the butter soften well before undertaking to cream<pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=143"/> it. A stout, blunt wooden spoon is the best for creaming, along with a deep bowl very narrow at the bottom. Grease deep cake tins plentifully, with either lard or butter--using only the best. For heavy cakes such as fruit, spice and marble cake, line them with double thicknesses of buttered paper and either set shallow pans of water in the oven while baking or stand the pans themselves in other pans with a quarter inch of water in the bottoms. If cakes brown too fast, open the oven door, a trifle, and lay over the pan a thick, well buttered paper until the oven cools. Never jar the oven while cake is baking in it--neither by banging the doors, nor dumping heavy vessels on top of it. Beware likewise slamming kitchen doors, or bumping things about in the room. Fine cake demands as many virtues of omission as of commission. Indeed the don'ts are as essential as the doings.</p><p>Layer cakes need to be mixed thinner than deep ones. The batter must run freely. Half fill the tins and set in a hot oven, taking care not to scorch before rising<pb n="140" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=144"/> is finished. Butter tins very freely--it is economy in the end. Be sure the tins sit level in the oven--thus you escape an ungainly final loaf. Get filling ready as baking goes forward so as to put your layers together while still warm and pliable. Let cool before frosting, so as to trim sides smooth. Take care fillings are not too watery, also that they are mixed smooth. Spread evenly, and press down a layer firmly all over, before putting filling on top. Layers simplify greatly the problem of baking, but to my mind, no layer cake, not even the famous Lady Baltimore, is equal to a fine deep loaf, well frosted, and meltingly rich throughout.</p>

The <ingredient>middle piece, known to butchers as "the bracelet,"</ingredient> is best for barbecuing.

This puts it in a sort of Gothic arch. Keep it so throughout the cooking. Put a cupful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> underneath--it must not touch the meat. Have the oven very hot, but not scorching--should it scorch in the least turn another pan over the meat for the first hour of cooking. Add more <ingredient>water</ingredient> as the first boils away, but do not baste the meat--the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is merely to keep it from getting too hard. Roast till the fat is crisped and brown throughout, the lean very tender. Take up on a broad, hot dish, and in serving cut along the ribs, so as to let each portion include the whole length of them, as well as part of the backbone. Serve with a sauce, of <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> mixed with equal quantity of strong <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> boiling hot, made thick with <ingredient>red and black pepper,</ingredient> minced <ingredient>cucumber pickle,</ingredient> and a bare dash of <ingredient>onion juice.</ingredient> This is as near an approach to a real barbecue, which is cooked over live coals in the bottom of a trench, as a civilized kitchen can supply.</p><p><variation>The

Pick carefully, draw and singe every manner of <ingredient>poultry and feathered game,</ingredient> wash clean, quickly, in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> never hot, drain, then wipe as dry as possible with a soft, thick, damp cloth--it takes up moisture cleaner than a dry one.

<section class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><emph rend="italic">Eggs:</emph> Eggs demand an introductory paragraph. As everybody knows, there are eggs and eggs. An egg new-laid has a tiny air-space at each end, betwixt the shell and the silken lining membrane. If left lying, this confined air changes its locality--leaves the ends for the upmost side of the shell. Shells are porous--through them the white evaporates--thus the air bubble on top gets bigger and bigger. By the size of it you can judge fairly the egg's age--unless it has been kept in cold storage or in water-glass. By boiling hard, throwing in cold water and peeling intact, you can see for yourself if a fresh egg so-called is truly fresh. If fresh there will be no perceptible marring of its oval--but if it shows a shrinkage, and especially if the yolk is so near the shell it shows through the cooked white, there is proof positive that the egg is not new-laid--though it may be perfectly wholesome.</p><p>Eggs kept in clean cool space do not<pb n="177" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=181"/> deteriorate under a month. Even after that, thus well kept, they answer for cake making, puddings and so on. But they have an ungodly affinity for taints of almost every kind. Hence keep them away from such things as onions, salt fish, things in brine generally, or any strong ill odors.</p><p>Duck eggs are bigger than hen eggs--eight of them being the equivalent to ten. Goose eggs run almost two for one. Turkey eggs, rarely used in cookery, are still excellent eating, much better flavored than duck eggs, which are often rather rank. Here as otherwheres, food is the determining factor. Guinea eggs, in spite of being so much smaller, are equal in raising power and in richness to hen eggs. Indeed, they are the best of all eggs for eating--rich, yet delicate. The only approach to them is the quail egg--we called it always a partridge egg--but only special favorites of the gods have any chance of ever tasting them. Quail nest frequently in wheat fields--at harvest, the uncovered nests yielded choice spoil. Daddy claimed the lion's share of it for "my white chilluns."<pb n="178" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=182"/> Often he came with his big hat-crown running over full of the delicate white ovals. Mormonism must prevail in quail circles--sometimes there were forty eggs in a nest. It would have been vandalism of the worst to eat them, only it was no use leaving them bare to the sun, as the birds abandoned them unless they had begun brooding. In that case the mother sat so tight, occasionally the reaper, passing over, took off her head. More commonly she flew away just in time, whirring up between the mules, with a great pretense of lameness. If the nest by good luck was discovered in time, grain was left standing about it. Nobody grudged the yard or so of wheat lost for the sake of sport.</p><p>Partridge eggs were boiled hard, and eaten out of hand--they were much too thin-shelled for roasting, in spite of having a very tough lining membrane. With guinea eggs there was quite another story. They have shells extra thick and hard--hence were laid plentifully in hot ashes, heaped over with live coals and left as long as our patience held out. When Mammy<pb n="179" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=183"/> pulled them out, it was maddening to see her test them. She laid a short broom straw delicately on each egg. If it whirled round, the egg was done--if contrariwise it fell off, it had to go back in the embers. She had no thought of letting us eat eggs not cooked till the yolk was mealy. To this day I am firmly of opinion she was wise--and right. Eggs roasted as she roasted them have a flavor wholly beyond and apart from those cooked in any other way.</p>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" region="south"><p><purpose rend="italic">Bananas:</purpose>
<ingredient>Bananas</ingredient> are far too unfamiliar in the kitchen. They can be cooked fifty ways--and in each be found excellent.

Or peel and slice, leave unseasoned, and lay in the pan <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> has been cooked in, first pouring away most of the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> Cook five minutes in a hot oven, and send to table with hot bread, crisp bacon and coffee for breakfast. <variation>A thick slice of <ingredient>banana,</ingredient> along with a thick slice of <ingredient>tart apple,</ingredient> both very lightly seasoned, makes a fine

<subsection class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><emph rend="italic">Baking Vegetables:</emph> Paper bags taught me the ease and value of cooking vegetables<pb n="209" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=213"/> in the oven rather than on top the stove. Less care is required, less water, rather less heat. Peas and lima beans, for example, after shelling, should be well washed, put in a pan with salt, seasoning and a little water, covered close, and baked in a hot oven half an hour to an hour. Green corn is never so well cooked, outside a paper bag, as by laying it on a rack in a covered pan, putting a little water underneath, covering close and setting the pan for nine minutes in a hot oven. It is sweeter and richer than even when put in cold unsalted water, brought to a boil, cooked one minute, then taken up. But however heat is applied, long cooking ruins it. Cook till the milk is set--not a second longer. Green peas should have several tender mint leaves put in with them, also sugar in proportion of a teaspoonful to half a pint of shelled peas. Lima beans are better flavored if the butter is put with them along with the water. Use only enough to make steam--say two tablespoonfuls to a fair-sized pan. Spinach and beet greens also bake well, but require<pb n="210" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=214"/> more water. Leave out salt, adding it after draining and chopping them. They take twenty to thirty minutes, according to age.</p><p>All manner of fruits, berries in especial, cook finely in the oven. Put in earthen or <implement>agate ware,</implement> with sugar, spices and a little water, cover close and cook half to three quarters of an hour, according to bulk. Uncover then--if done take up, if not let cook uncovered as long as needed. Set the baking dishes always on rack or a grid-shelf, never on the oven bottom nor solid metal. Thus the danger of burning is minimized, also the need of stirring.</p>

Get a pound of streaky <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> cut square if possible, scrape and wash clean, put on in plenty of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with a young <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> bring to a quick boil, throw in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> skim the pot clean, then let stand simmering for two to three hours.

Here is the foundation of a hearty and wholesome meal. The <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> by long boiling is in a measure emulsified, and calculated to nourish the most delicate stomach rather than to upset it. Serve two thin slices of it with each helping of greens. You should have plenty of Cayenne vinegar, very hot and sharp, hot corn bread, and cider or beer, to go along with it.</p></recipe>
<p>String beans, known to the south country as snaps, never come fully to their own, unless thus cooked with bacon. Even pork<pb n="212" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=216"/> does not answer, though that is far and away better than boiling and buttering or flooding with milk sauces. It is the same with cabbage. Wash well, halve or quarter, boil until very tender, drain and serve. Better cook as many as the pot will hold and the bacon season, since fried cabbage, which is chopped fine, and tossed in bacon fat with a seasoning of pepper, salt and vinegar, helps out wonderfully for either breakfast, luncheon or supper. Never throw away proper pot-liquor--it is a good and cheap substitute for soup on cold days. Heat, and drop into it crisp bread-crusts--if they are corn bread crusts made very brown, all the better. Pioneer folk throve on pot-liquor to such an extent they had a saying that it was sinful to have too much--pot-liquor and buttermilk at the same meal.</p></section>

Cut off crusts for ordinary sandwiches--but if shaping them with cutters let it stay. Then you can cut to the paper-thinness requisite--otherwise that is impossible. Work at a roomy table spread with a clean old tablecloth over which put sheets of clean, thick paper. Do your cutting on the papered surface--thus you save either turning your knife edges against a platter or sorely gashing even an old cloth. Keep fancy cutters all together and ready to your hand. Shape one kind of sandwiches all the same--thus you distinguish them easily. Make as many as your paper space will hold, before stamping out any--this saves time and strength. Clear away the fragments from one making, before beginning another sort, thus avoiding possible taints and confusion. Lay your made sandwiches on a platter under a dry cloth with a double damp one on top of it. They will not dry out, and it is much easier than wrapping in oiled paper.</p><p><variation>The nearer fillings approach the consistency<pb n="217" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=221"/> of soft butter, the better.

<recipe class1="accompaniments" region="south"><p><purpose rend="italic">Brine for Pickling:</purpose>
Use <ingredient>rain water</ingredient> if possible and regular <ingredient><alt synonym1="pickling">picking</alt> salt</ingredient>--it is coarse and much stronger than cooking salt. Lacking <ingredient>rain water,</ingredient> soften other <ingredient>water</ingredient> by dissolving in it the day beforehand, a pinch of washing <ingredient>soda</ingredient>--this neutralizes largely the mineral contents. Put over the fire in a deep, clean kettle, bring to a boil, put in <ingredient>salt</ingredient>--a pint to the gallon of <ingredient>water</ingredient> is the usual proportion. Boil and skim, add a pinch of <ingredient>saltpeter</ingredient> and tablespoonful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> for each pint of <ingredient>salt</ingredient>--the pinches must not be large. Add also six whole <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> for each gallon. Take from fire, let cool, drop in an <ingredient>egg</ingredient><pb n="221" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=225"/> --it should float to show the size of a quarter of a dollar. Otherwise the brine needs more <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Dissolve a pint extra in as little <ingredient>water</ingredient> as suffices, and add to the brine, then test again. Put the brine when cold into a clean, roomy vessel, a keg or barrel, else a big <implement>stone crock.</implement> It should not quite half fill it. Provide a heading that will float upon it, also a light weight to keep the heading on the pickles when put in, and hold them under the brine. Unless so held the uppermost rot, and spoil the lot. Mold will gather around the head in spite of the <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> but less than without them. Whenever you put in fresh pickles, take out the head, wash and scald, dry, and return to place.</p></recipe>
<p>Anything edible will make pickle--still there are many things better kept out of the brine. Cabbage and cauliflower for example do not need it--green tomatoes, onions, and Jerusalem artichokes are likewise taboo. The <ingredient>artichokes</ingredient> make good pickle, but it must be made all at once. Cut anything intended for the brine with a bit of <ingredient>stalk,</ingredient> and without<pb n="222" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=226"/> bruising the <ingredient>stalk.</ingredient> <ingredient>Cucumbers</ingredient> should be small, and even in size, <ingredient>gherkins</ingredient> about half grown, <ingredient>string beans,</ingredient> three parts grown, <ingredient>crook-neck squash</ingredient> very small and tender, <ingredient>green peppers</ingredient> for mangoes, full grown but not turning, <ingredient>muskmelons</ingredient> for other mangoes three parts grown. Wash clean or wipe with a damp cloth. Cut pickles in early morning, so they may be fresh and crisp. Never put in any wilted bit--thereby you invite decay.</p><p><ingredient>Watermelon rind</ingredient> makes fine <ingredient>pickle.</ingredient> sweet and sour--also <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> queen of all home made preserves. It must be fairly thick, sound and unbruised. The <ingredient>Rattle Snake melon</ingredient> has a good <ingredient>rind</ingredient> for such uses. The finer flavored and thinner-rinded varieties that come to market, are rarely worth cutting up. The cutting up is a bit tedious. The <ingredient>rind</ingredient> must be cut in strips rather more than an inch wide and three to five inches long, then trimmed on each side, free of green outer skin, and all trace of the soft inside. There will remain less than half an inch thickness of firm pale green tissue with potentialities<pb n="223" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=227"/> of delight--if you know how to bring them out.</p><p>Firm <ingredient>clingstone peaches</ingredient> not fully ripe, can be put in the brine--they had better, however, be pickled without it. For whatever is put in, and saved by <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> must be freed of the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> by long soaking before it is fit to eat. The soaking process is the same for everything--take from brine, wash clean in <ingredient>tepid water,</ingredient> put to soak in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> with something on top to hold the pickles down. Change <ingredient>water</ingredient> twice the first day, afterward every day, until it has not the least <ingredient>salt</ingredient> taste.</p><p><variation>You can make pickle by soaking in <ingredient>brine</ingredient> three days, then washing clean, putting over the fire in clear <ingredient>water,</ingredient> bringing to scalding heat, then pouring off the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> covering with <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and bringing just to a boil. Drain away this <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> which has served its turn, pack down the pickles in a jar, seasoning them well with <ingredient>mixed spices,</ingredient> whole, not in powder, covering with fresh, hot <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> letting cool uncovered, then tieing down, and keep dark and cool.</variation></p>

<ingredient>Peaches,</ingredient> <ingredient>pears,</ingredient> <ingredient>plums,</ingredient> or <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> the process is much the same.

I am firmly of opinion that many a patent coffee-maker has gone on to success through the fact that cups were filled directly from the urn. I always feel that I taste my coffee mostly with my nose--nothing refreshes me like the clean, keen fragrance of it--especially after broken rest. It is idle to talk as so many<pb n="237" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=241"/> authorities do, of using "Java and Mocha blended." All the real Java and Mocha in the world is snapped up, long before it filters down to the average level. Back in the Dark Ages of my childhood, I knew experimentally real Java--we got it by the sack-full straight from New Orleans--and called the Rio coffee used by many of our neighbors "Seed tick coffee," imagining its flavor was like the smell of those pests. Nowadays, Rio coffee has pretty well the whole world for its parish. Wherefore the best one can do, is to get it sound, well roasted, and as fresh as may be. Much as I love and practice home preparation, I am willing to let the Trust or who will, roast my coffee. Roasting is parlous work, hot, tedious, and tiresome, also mighty apt to result in scorching if not burning. One last caution--never meddle with the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> unless sure your hand is light, your memory so trustworthy you will not put it in twice.</p><p><variation><purpose>Chocolate</purpose>

Yet--I am said to make<pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=242"/> it well. Perhaps the secret lies in the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient>--a scant teaspoonful for each cake of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> grated.

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="239" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=243"/><illustration><description>A woman sits in front of a peach tree, cutting fruit into a bowl on her lap.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">When the Orchards "Hit"</hd><p>When the peach orchard "hit" it meant joy to the plantation. Peaches had so many charms--and there were so many ways of stretching the charms on through winter scarcity. Peach drying was in a sort, a festival, especially if there were a kiln, which made one independent of the weather. It took many hands wielding many sharp knives in fair fruit to keep a kiln of fair size running regularly. This though it were no more than a thing of flat stones and clean clay mud, with paper laid over the mud, and renewed periodically. There was a shed roof, over the kiln, which sat commonly in the edge of the orchard. Black Daddy tended the firing<pb n="240" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=244"/> --with a couple of active lads to cut and fetch wood, what time they were not fetching in great baskets of peaches.</p><p>Yellow peaches, not too ripe but full flavored, made the lightest and sweetest dried fruit. And clingstones were ever so much better for drying than the clear-seed sorts. Some folk took off the peach fuzz with lye--they did not, I think, save trouble thereby, and certainly lost somewhat in the flavor of their fruit. Mammy was a past mistress of cutting "cups." That is to say, half-peaches, with only the seed deftly removed. She sat with the biggest <implement>bread tray</implement> upon her well cushioned knees, in the midst of the peelers, who as they peeled, dropped their peaches into the tray.</p><p>When it over-ran with cups, somebody slimmer and suppler, took it away, and spread the cut fruit, just touching, all over the hot kiln. It must not be too hot--just so you couldn't bear the back of your hand to it was about right. Daddy kept the temperature even, by thrusting into the flues underneath it, long sticks of green wood, kindled well at the flue-mouths.<pb n="241" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=245"/> Cups shrank mightily in a little while--you could push of an early trayful till it would no more than cover space the size of a big dish, long before dinner time--in other words twelve o'clock--drying was in full blast by seven. With fruit in gluts, and dropping fast, the kiln was supplemented by scaffolds. Clean planks laid upon trestles, and set in full sunshine, gave excellent accounts of themselves. This of course if the sun shone steadily--in showery weather scaffold-drying was no end of trouble. Weather permitting, it made--it still makes--the finest and most flavorous dried fruit ever eaten.</p><p>The black people chose clear-seed peaches for their individual drying. They made merry over splitting the fruit, and placing it, sitting out in front of their cabins in the moonshine, or by torch-light. Washing was all they gave the peach outsides--a little thing like a fuzzy rind their palates did not object to. It was just as well, since clear-seed fruit, peeled, shrinks unconscionably--to small scrawny knots, inclined to be sticky--though it is but just<pb n="242" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=246"/> to add, that in cooking, it comes back to almost its original succulence. When the peach-cutting was done, there was commonly a watermelon feast. Especially at Mammy's house--Daddy's watermelons were famed throughout the county. He gave seed of them sparingly, and if the truth must be told, rather grudgingly--but nobody ever brought melons to quite his pitch of perfection. Possibly because he planted for the most part, beside rotting stumps in the new ground, where the earth had to be kept light and clean for tobacco, and where the vines got somewhat of shade, and the roots fed fat upon the richness of virgin soil.</p><p>It took eight bushels of ripe fruit, to make one of dry--this when the peaches were big and fleshy. Small, seedy sorts demanded ten bushels for one. Unpeeled, the ratio fell to seven for one. But there was seldom any lack of fruit--beside the orchard, there were trees up and down all the static fence rows--the corner of a worm fence furnishing an ideal seat. Further, every field boasted trees, self-<pb n="243" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=247"/> planted, sprung from chance seed vagrantly cast. These volunteer trees often had the very best fruit--perhaps because only peaches of superior excellence had been worth carrying a-field. Tilth also helped--the field trees bent and often broke under their fruity burdens. It was only when late frosts made half or three parts of the young fruit drop, that we knew how fine and beautiful these field peaches could be. Our trees, being all seedlings, were in a degree, immortelles. Branches, even trunks might bend and break, but the seminal roots sent up new shoots next season, which in another year, bore fruit scantily. Still, these renewals never gave quite such perfect fruit as grew upon vigorous young trees, just come to full bearing.</p><p>Here or there a plantation owner like my starch and stately grandfather, turned surplus peaches into brandy. In that happy time excise was--only a word in the dictionary, so the yield of certain trees, very free-bearing, of small, deep, red, clear-seed fruit, was allowed to get dead-ripe on the trees, then mashed to a pulp in the<pb n="244" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=248"/> cider trough, and put into stands to ferment, then duly distilled. Barrelled, after two years in the lumber house, it was racked into clean barrels, and some part of it converted into "peach and honey," the favorite gentleman's tipple. Strained honey was mixed with the brandy in varying proportions--the amount depending somewhat upon individual tastes. Some used one measure of honey to three of brandy, others put one to two, still others, half and half, qualifying the sweetness by adding neat brandy at the time of drinking. Peach and honey was kept properly in stone jugs or in <implement>demijohns,</implement> improved mightily with age, and was, at its best, to the last degree insidious. Newly mixed it was heady, but after a year or more, as smooth as oil, and as mellow. The honey had something to do with final excellence. That which the bees gathered from wild raspberries in flower, being very clear, light-colored and fine-flavored, was in especial request.</p><p>I think these peaches of the brandy orchards traced back to those the Indians,<pb n="245" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=249"/> Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees, planted in the mountain valleys of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. They got the seed from early Spaniard voyagers to Florida. There was indeed a special Indian peach, as dark-skinned as its namesake, blood-red inside and out, very sweet and full of juice, if permitted to ripen fully--but as ill-tasting almost as a green persimmon, if unripe. There were clear-stone and clingstone sorts, and one tree differed from another in glory of flavor, even as one star. That was the charm of our seedlings--which had further a distinction of flavor no commercial fruit ever yet owned.</p><p>August peaches were for drying--in September, early, came the Heaths, for preserves, brandy fruit, and so on. October peaches, nearly all clear-seed, made the finest peach butter. Understand, in those days, canning, known as "hermetic sealing," was still a laboratory process. I wonder if anybody else recalls, as I do, the first editions of fruit cans? They were of tin, tall and straight, with a flaring up-<pb n="246" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=250"/> standing tin ruffle around the tops. The ruffle was for holding the sealing wax, into which the edge of the tin top was thrust. They did not last long--pretty soon, there were cans of the present shape--but sealing them with wax was hard work, likewise uncertain. Women everywhere should rise and call blessed he who invented the self-sealing jar.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="accompaniments" region="south"><p>Return we to our 
 
<purpose>peach butter.</purpose>
It began in cider--the <ingredient>cider from fall apples,</ingredient> very rich and sweet. To boil it down properly required a battery of brass kettles swung over a log fire in the yard, the same as at drying up lard time. Naturally brass kettles were at a premium--but luckily everybody did not make peach butter, so it was no strain upon neighborly comity to borrow of such. It took more than half a day to boil down the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> properly--kettles were filled up constantly as there was room. By and by, when the contents became almost syrup, <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> went in--preferably the late, soft, white ones, dead ripe, very juicy, and nearly as sweet as sugar. After the kettles were full<pb n="247" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=251"/> of them, peeled and halved, of course, the boiling went on until the fruit was mushy. Constant stirring helped to make it so. Fresh <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> were added twice, and cooked down until the paddle stood upright in the middle of the kettle. Then came the spicing--putting in <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> bruised <ingredient>ginger,</ingredient> and <ingredient>alspice</ingredient>--sparingly, but enough to flavor delicately. <variation>If the <ingredient>white peaches</ingredient> ran short, there might be a supplemental butter-making when the <ingredient>Red Octobers</ingredient> came in, at the very last of the month. They were big and handsome, oval, with the richest crimson cheeks, but nothing like so sweet as the white ones. So <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> was added scantily, at the end of the boiling down. If it had been put in earlier, it would have added to the danger of burning.</variation></p></recipe>
<p>A six-gallon <implement>crock</implement> of peach butter was no mean household asset--indeed it ranked next to the <implement>crock</implement> of blackberry jam. It was good as a sauce, or lightly sweetened, to spread on crust. As a filling for roly-polys it had but one superior--namely dried peaches properly stewed.</p><pb n="248" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=252"/>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="accompaniments" region="south"><p>Proper stewing meant washing a quart of <ingredient>dry fruit</ingredient> in two waters, soaking overnight, then putting over the fire in the soaking <ingredient>water,</ingredient> covering with a plate to hold the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> down, and simmering at the least five hours, filling up the kettle from time to time, and adding after the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> was soft a pound of <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Then at the very last <ingredient>spices</ingredient> to taste went in. If the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> were to be eaten along with meat, as a relish, a cupful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> was added after the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> This made it a near approach to the finest sweet pickle. But as Mammy said often: "Dried 
 
<purpose><alt synonym1="stewed peaches">peaches</alt></purpose>

<p>Apple drying commonly came a little before peach. Horse apples, the best and plentiest, ripened in the beginning of August. They were kiln-dried, or scaffold-dried, and much less tedious than peaches since they were sliced thin. When they got very mellow, drying ceased--commonly everybody had plenty by that time--and the making of apple butter began. It differed little from peach butter in the making,<pb n="249" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=253"/> though mightily in taste--being of a less piquant flavor. Cider, newly run was essential to any sort of butter--hence the beating was done before breakfast. Cider mills were not--but cider troughs abounded. They were dug from huge poplar logs, squared outside with the broad axe, and adzed within to a smooth finish. Apples well washed, were beaten in them with round headed wooden <implement>pestles,</implement> and pressed in <implement>slat presses,</implement> the pomace laid on clean straw, after the manner of cider pressing in English orchards. The first runnings, somewhat muddy, were best for boiling down, but the clear last runnings drank divinely--especially after keeping until there was just the trace of sparkle to them.</p><p>Winter cider was commonly allowed to get hard. So was that meant for distilling--apple brandy was only second to peach. But a barrel or keg, would be kept sweet for women, children, and ministers--either by smoking the inside of a clean barrel well with sulphur before putting in the cider, or by hanging inside a barrel nearly<pb n="250" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=254"/> full, a thin muslin bag full of white mustard seed. Cider from russets and pear apples had a peculiar excellence, so was kept for Christmas and other high days.</p><p>Pear cider--perry--we knew only in books. Not through lack of pears but inclination to make it. Pears were dried the same as other fruit, but commonly packed down after drying in sugar. Thus they were esteemed nearly as good as peach chips, or even peach leather.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose>Peach chips</purpose>
were sliced thin, packed down in their own weight of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and let stand twenty-four hours to toughen. Then the syrup was drained from them, boiled, skimmed clean, spiced with <ingredient>mace</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon peel,</ingredient> and the slices dropped into it a few at a time and cooked until sweet through. Then they were skimmed out, spread on dishes well sprinkled with <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> dredged with more <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> set under glass in sunshine and turned daily until dry. They were delicious, and served as other confections--passed around with nuts and wine, or eaten instead of candy.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" region="south"><p>So were cherries, dried in exactly the<pb n="251" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=255"/> same manner, after pitting. When dried without sugar they were used for cooking. So also were 
 
<purpose>tomato figs.</purpose>
<ingredient>Yellow tomatoes,</ingredient> smooth and even were best--but red ones answered--the meatier the better. After scalding, peeling, soaking an hour in clear <ingredient>lime-water</ingredient> to harden, they were rinsed clean, then dropped in thick boiling <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> a few at a time, simmered an hour, then skimmed out, drained, sugared and dried under glass in the sun, or failing sunshine, upon dishes in a very slow oven. Full-dry, they were packed down in <ingredient>powdered sugar,</ingredient> in glass jars kept tightly closed. Unless thus kept they had a knack of turning sticky--which defeated the purpose of their creation.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="breadsweets" region="south"><p><purpose>Peach leather</purpose>
may not appeal to this day of many sweets--but it was good indeed back in the spare elder time. To make it the very ripest, softest <ingredient>peaches</ingredient> were peeled, and mashed smooth, working quickly so the pulp might not color too deeply, then spread an inch thick upon large dishes or even clean boards, and dried slowly in sunshine or the oven.<pb n="252" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=256"/> After it was full-dry, came the cutting into inch-strips. This took a very sharp knife and a steady hand. Then the strips were coiled edgewise into flat rounds, with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> between the rounds of the coils, which had to be packed down in more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and kept close, to save them from dampness, which meant ruin.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" region="south"><p>If you had a fond and extravagant grandmother, you were almost sure to have also a

That is to say, a fine firm winter <ingredient>apple,</ingredient> stuck as full of <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> as it could hold, then allowed to dry very, very slowly, in air neither hot nor cold.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy" region="south"><p>The quince tree is the clown of the orchard, growing twisted and writhing, as though hating a straight line. Notwithstanding,<pb n="253" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=257"/> its fruit, and the uses thereof, set the hall mark of housewifery. Especially in the matter of jelly-making and marmalade. Further a 
 
<purpose>quince pudding</purpose>
is in the nature of an experience--so few have ever heard of it, so much fewer made or tasted it. The making requires very ripe <ingredient>quinces</ingredient>--begin by scrubbing them clean of fuzz, then set them in a deep pan, cover, after adding a tablespoonful of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and bake slowly until very soft.

Bake in a deep pan, and serve hot with <ingredient>hard or wine sauce.</ingredient></p></recipe>
<p>Here are some fine points of jelly-making learned in that long ago. To make the finest, clearest jelly, cook but little at a time. A large kettleful will never have the color and brightness of two or three glasses. Never undertake to make jelly of inferior fruit--that which is unripe or<pb n="254" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=258"/> over-ripe, or has begun to sour. Wash clean, and drain--paring is not only waste work, but in a measure lessens flavor. Put a little water with the fruit when you begin cooking it--cook rather slowly so there shall be no scorching, and drain out rather than press out the juice. Draining is much freer if the fruit is spread thin, rather than dumped compactly in a bag. Double <implement>cheese cloth</implement> sewed fast over stout wire, and laid on top of a wide bowl, makes a fine <implement>jelly drainer</implement>--one cheap enough to be thrown away when discolored. A discolored bag, by the way, makes jelly a bit darker. If there is no pressure flannel is not required.</p><p>Plenty as fruit was with us, Mammy made jelly and marmalade from the same quinces. They were well washed, peeled, quartered and the cores removed, then the quarters boiled until soft in water to half-cover them, skimmed out, mashed smooth with their own weight of sugar, and spices to taste, then cooked very slowly until the spoon stood upright in the mass, after<pb n="255" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=259"/> which it went into glass jars, and had a <implement>brandy paper</implement> laid duly on top.</p><p>Cores and paring were boiled to rags in water to fully cover them, then strained out, the water strained again, and added to that in which the fruit had boiled. Sugar was added--a pound to the pint of juice. But first the juice was brought to a boil, and skimmed very clean. The sugar, heated without scorching, went in, and cooking continued until the drop on the tip of the spoon jellied as it fell. Mammy hated jelly that ran--it must cut like butter to reach her standard. Occasionally she flavored it with ginger--boiling the bruised root with the cores--but only occasionally, as ginger would make the jelly darker. Occasionally also she cooked apples, usually fall pippins, with the quinces, thus increasing the bulk of both jelly and marmalade, with hardly a sensible diminution of flavor.</p><p>All here written applies equally to every sort of fruit jelly--apple, peach, currant, the whole family of berries. Mammy<pb n="256" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=260"/> never knew it, but I myself have found the oven at half-heat a very present help in jelly-making. Fruit well prepared, and put into a stone or agate vessel, covered and baked gently for a time proportionate to its bulk, yields all its juice, and it seems to me clearer juice, than when stewed in the time-honored brass kettle. Hot sugar helps to jellying quickly--and the more haste there, the lighter and brighter the result. Gelatin in fruit jellies I never use--it increases the product sensibly, but that is more than offset by the decrease in quality.</p></chapter>
<chapter class1="foodandnonfood"><pb n="257" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=261"/><illustration><description>An illustration of a long dinner table decorated with garlands and three tall candelabras. A large cake is placed in the center of the table, but the rest of the dishes are empty.</description></illustration><hd align="center" rend="ornate">Upon Occasions</hd><p>It was no trouble at all to make occasions. Indeed, the greatest of them, weddings, really made themselves. A wedding made imperative an infare--that is to say, if the high contracting parties had parental approval. Maybe I had better explain that infare meant the bride's going home--to her new house, or at least her new family. This etymologically--the root is the Saxon <emph rend="italic">faran,</emph> to go, whence come wayfaring, faring forth and so on. All this I am setting forth not in pedantry, but because so many folk had stared blankly upon hearing the word--which was to me as familiar as word could be. In application<pb n="258" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=262"/> it had a wide latitude. Commonly the groom or his <alt synonym1="family">famly</alt> gave the infare, but often enough some generous and well-to-do friend, or kinsman, pre-empted the privilege. Wherever held, it was an occasion of keen and jealous rivalry--those in charge being doubly bent on making the faring in more splendid than the wedding feast. Naturally that put the wedding folk on their mettle. Another factor inciting to extra effort was--the bundles. All guests were expected to take home with them generous bundles of wedding cake in all its varieties. I recall once hearing a famous cake baker sigh relief as she frosted the hundredth snow ball, and said: "Now we are sure to have enough left for the bundles--they are such a help."</p><p>But baking cakes, and cooking in general, though important, were not the main things. Setting the table, so it should outshine all other wedding tables gave most concern. To this end all the resources of the family, and its friends for a radius of ten miles, were available--glass, silver, china, linen, even cook pots and ovens at<pb n="259" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=263"/> need. Also and further it was a slight of the keenest, if you were known as a fine cake maker, not to be asked to help. A past mistress of paper cutting was likewise in request. Cut papers and evergreens were the great reliances in decoration. They made a brave showing by candlelight. Oil lamps were few, kerosene undiscovered, and either lard oil, or whale oil, all too often smelled to heaven, to say nothing of smoking upon the least provocation. So a lamp, if there were one, sat in state within the parlor. The long table got its light from candelabra--which as often as not were homemade. The base was three graduated blocks of wood, nailed to form a sort of pyramid, with a hole bored in the middle to receive a stout round upright, two inches across. It stood a foot high, and held up cross-arms three feet across, with a tin candlesocket upon each end. Another socket was set where the arms crossed--thus each candelabra was of five-candle power. Set a-row down the middle of the table, with single candles in tall brass sticks interspersed, they gave a fine<pb n="260" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=264"/> soft illumination. Often they were supplemented with candelabra of bronze or brass, tricked out with tinkly pendant prisms. Such household gauds were commonly concentrated at the spot where the bride and her maids would stand. They were more elegant, of course, than the made candle-holders--but not to my thinking a whit the handsomer--after the paper-cutters had done their work.</p><p>Their work was turning white paper into fringe and lace. Fringed strips wound all over and about, hid the foundation wood. Paper tulips, deftly fashioned, held the tin rings in ambush--with clusters of lacy leaves pendant below. Sometimes a paper rose tipped each arm-end--sometimes also, there were pendant sprays of pea-shaped blossoms. How they were made, with nothing beyond scissors, pen-knives for crimping, and the palm of the hand for mold, I confess I do not understand--but I know they were marvels. The marvels required a special knack, of course--also much time and patience. Wherefore those who had it, exercised it in scraps of leisure<pb n="261" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=265"/> as paper came to hand, laying away the results against the next wedding even though none were imminent. Leaves and the round lace-edged pieces to go under cakes, it was easy thus to keep. Flowers, roses, tulips and so on, had a trick of losing shape--besides, although so showy, they were really much easier to make.</p><p>It took nice contrivance to make table-room--but double thicknesses of damask falling to the floor either side hid all roughness in the foundation. Shape depended much upon the size of the supper-room--if it were but an inclosed piazza, straight length was imperative. But in a big square or parallelogram, one could easily achieve a capital <emph rend="italic">H</emph>--or else a letter <emph rend="italic">Z.</emph> <emph rend="italic">Z</emph> was rather a favorite in that it required less heavy decoration, yet gave almost as much space. A heart-cake for either tip, a stack at each acute angle, with the bride's cake midway the stem, flanked either hand by bowls of syllabub and boiled custard, made a fine showing. A letter <emph rend="italic">H</emph> demanded four heartcakes--one for each end, also four stacks, and crowded the<pb n="262" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=266"/> bride and her party along the joining bar.</p><p>Heart-cakes were imperative to any wedding of degree. Local tinsmiths made the moulds for them--they were deeply cleft, and not strictly classic of outline. But, well and truly baked, frosted a glistening white, then latticed and fringed with more frosting, dribbled on delicately from the point of a tube, they were surely good to look at. If the bride's cake were white all through, the heart-pans were usually filled with gold-cake batter--thus white and yolk of eggs had equal honor. More commonly though, the most part of wedding cake was pound cake in the beginning--the richer the better. Baked in deep round-bottomed, handleless coffee cups, and iced, it made the helpful snow balls. Baked in square pans, rather shallow, cut into bars, crisped, frosted and piled cob-house fashion, it made pens. Sliced crosswise and interlaid with jelly it became jelly cake. To supplement it, there were marble cake, spice cake, plum cake, ever so many more cakes--but they were--only supplements.</p><p>Stacks were either round or square,<pb n="263" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=267"/> baked in pans of graduated size, set one on the other after cooling thoroughly, then frosted and re-frosted till they had a polar suggestion. If round there was commonly a hole running down the middle, into this was fitted a wide mouthed but small glass bottle, to hold the stems of the evergreen plume topping the stack. Here or there in the plume, shone a paper rose or star-flower--in the wreath of evergreen laid about the base, were tulips, lilies, and bigger roses, all made of paper. Occasionally trailing myrtle, well washed and dried, was put about the components of the stacks just before they were set in place. If the heart-cakes had missed being latticed, they likewise were myrtle-wreathed. The bride's cake was left dead-white, but it always stood on something footed, and had a wreath of evergreen and paper flowers, laid upon a lace-cut paper about the foot.</p><p>Baking it was an art. So many things had to go in it--the darning needle, thimble, picayune, ring, and button. The makers would have scorned utterly the modern subterfuge of baking plain, and<pb n="264" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=268"/> thrusting in the portents of fate before frosting. They mixed the batter a trifle stiff, washed and scoured everything, shut eyes, dropped them, and stirred them well about. Thus nobody had the least idea where they finally landed--so the cutting was bound to be strictly fair. It made much fun--the bride herself cut the first slice--hoping it might hold the picayune, and thus symbolize good fortune. The ring presaged the next bride or groom, the darning needle single blessedness to the end, the thimble, many to sew for, or feed, the button, fickleness or disappointment. After the bridal party had done cutting, other young folk tempted fate. Bride's cake was not for eating--instead, fragments of it, duly wrapped and put under the pillow, were thought to make whatever the sleeper dreamed come true. Especially if the dream included a sweetheart, actual or potential. The dreams were supposed to be truly related next day at the infare--but I question if they always were. Perhaps the magic worked--and in this wise--the person dreamed of took on<pb n="265" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=269"/> so new a significance, the difference was quickly felt. But this is a cook book--with reminiscent attachments, not a treatise on psychology.</p><p>The table held only the kickshaws--cakes, candy, nuts, syllabub and custard. Wide handsome plates piled high with tempting sliced cake sat up and down the length of it, with glass dishes of gay candies in between. In cold weather wine jelly often took the place of syllabub. There were neither napkins nor service plates--all such things came from the side table, the plates laden with turkey, ham, fried chicken, or broiled, and some sort of jelly or relish. One ate standing, with her escort doing yeoman service as waiter, until her appetite was fully appeased. Hot biscuit, hot egg bread, and light bread--salt rising, freshly sliced--were passed about by deft black servitors. The side tables were under charge of family friends, each specially skilled in helping and serving. Carving, of course, had been done before hand. Occasionally, very occasionally, where a wedding throng ran well<pb n="266" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=270"/> into the hundreds, there was barbecue in addition to other meat. In that case it was cut up outside, and sent in upon huge platters. But it was more a feature of infares, held commonly by daylight, than of wedding suppers.</p><p>Wedding salad is set forth in its proper chapter, but not the turkey hash that was to some minds 
the best of all the good eating. It was 
served for breakfast--there was always a crowd of kinfolk and faraway friends to stay all night--sleeping on pallets all over the floors, even those of parlor or ballroom, after they were deserted. The hash was made from all the left-over turkey--where a dozen birds have been roasted the leavings will be plenty. To it was added the whole array of giblets, cooked the day before, and cut small while still warm. They made heaps of rich gravy to add to that in the turkey pots--no real wedding ever contented itself with cooking solely on a range. Pots, big ones, set beside a log fire out of doors, with a little water in the bottom, and coals underneath and on<pb n="267" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=271"/> the lids, turned out turkeys beautifully browned, tender and flavorous, to say nothing of the gravy. It set off the hash as nothing else could--but such setting off was not badly needed. Hash with hot biscuit, strong clear coffee, hot egg bread, and thin-sliced ham, made a breakfast one could depend on, even with a long drive cross-country in prospect.</p>

Flecks of crimson <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> were dropped on the white <ingredient>cream</ingredient>--occasionally, there were crumbled <ingredient>cake,</ingredient> and cut up <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> underneath. Thus it approximated the trifle of the cook books. It had just one drawback--you could not eat it slowly--it went almost to nothing at the agitation of the spoon.</p></recipe>

<purpose>boiled custard</purpose>--which was much higher in favor, being easier made, and quite as showy. For it you beat very light the <ingredient>yolks of twelve eggs</ingredient> with four cups <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> added them to a gallon of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and a quart of <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> in a brass kettle over the fire, stirred the mixture steadily, watching it close to remove it just as it was on the point of boiling, let it cool, then flavored it well, with either <ingredient>whiskey,</ingredient> <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sweet wine.</ingredient> Meantime the <ingredient>egg-whites</ingredient> beaten with a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> until they stuck to the dish, had been cooked by pouring quickly over them <ingredient>full-boiling water</ingredient> from a tea kettle.

Plutocrats had not then been invented--but tradition tells of one high gentleman, who was self-sufficient. The<pb n="269" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=273"/> fact stood him in good stead later--when he was darkly accused, she who had baked cakes for all his merry-makings said stoutly: "The Colonel do sech as that!

<p>Is anybody left, I wonder, who can cut oranges into lilies? Thus cut they surely looked pretty. The peel was divided evenly in six, the sections loosened, but not pulled free at the base. Instead the ends were curved backward after the manner of lily petals. The fruit, separated into eighths, hardly showed the divisions. These lilies sat flat upon the cloth, either in lines, as about square stacks, or around bigger things, or straight up and down the table center. They were not always in season--at their best around Christmas, but available until the end of winter.</p><p>Cheesecakes, baked in <implement>patty pans</implement><pb n="270" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=274"/> frosted with cocoanut frosting, also helped out the wedding richness. Indeed, guests gathered to eat the fat and the sweet, no less to drink it. Now, in a wider outlook, I wonder a little if there was significance in the fact that these wedding tables were so void of color--showing only green and white, with the tiniest sparks of red?</p><p>Party suppers had no such limitations--often the table was gay with autumn leaves, the center piece a riot of small ragged red chrysanthemums, or raggeder pink or yellow ones, with candles glaring from gorgeous pumpkin jack-o'-lanterns down the middle, or from the walls either side. There were frosted cakes--loaves trimmed gaily with red and white candies, or maybe the frosting itself was tinted. In place of syllabub or boiled custard, there were bowls of ambrosia--oranges in sections, freed of skin and seed, and smothered in grated fresh cocoanut and sugar. Often the bowl-tops were ornamented with leaves cut deftly from the skin of deep red apples, and alternating, other leaves shaped from orange peel. Christmas party suppers<pb n="271" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=275"/> had touches of holly and cedar, but there was no attempt to match the elaborate wedding tables. Hog's foot jelly, red with the reddest wine, came in handily for them--since almost every plantation had a special small hog-killing, after the middle of December, so there might be fresh backbones, spare ribs, sausage and souse to help make Christmas cheer. Ham, spiced and sliced wafer thin, was staple for such suppers--chicken and turkey appeared oftenest as salad, hot coffee, hot breads in variety, crisp celery, and plenteous pickle, came before the sweets. Punch, not very heady, hardly more than a fortified pink lemonade, came with the sweets many times. Grandfather's punch was held sacred to very late suppers, hot and hearty, set for gentlemen who had played whist or euchre until cock-crow.</p><p>These are but indications. Fare varied even as did households and occasions. But everywhere there was kinship of the underlying spirit--which was the concrete expression of hospitality in good cheer. There was little luxury--rather we lived<pb n="272" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=276"/> amid a spare abundance, eating up what had no market--I recall clearly times when you could hardly give away fresh eggs, or frying-size chickens, other times when eggs fetched five cents for two dozen--provided the seller would "take it in trade." Chickens then, broiling size, were forty to fifty cents the dozen--with often an extra one thrown in for good measure. For then chicken cholera had not been invented--at least not down in the Tennessee blue grass country. Neither had hog cholera--nor railroads. All three fell upon us a very little before the era of the Civil War. Steamboats ran almost half the year, but the flat boat traffic had been taken away by the peopling prairies, which could raise so much more corn, derivatively so many more hogs, to the man's work. Money came through wheat and tobacco--not lavishly, yet enough for our needs. All this is set forth in hope of explaining in some measure, the cookery I have tried to write down faithfully--with so much of everything in hand, stinting would have been sinful.</p><pb n="273" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=277"/>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>There was 
 
<purpose>barbecue,</purpose>
and again there were barbecues. The viand is said to get its name from the French phrase <emph rend="italic">a barbe d' ecu,</emph> from tail to head, signifying that the carcass was cooked whole. The derivation may be an early example of making the punishment fit the crime. As to that I do not know. What I do know is that <ingredient>lambs,</ingredient> <ingredient>pigs,</ingredient> and <ingredient>kids,</ingredient> when barbecued, are split in half along the backbone. The animals, butchered at sundown, and cooled of animal heat, after washing down well, are laid upon clean, split sticks of green wood over a trench two feet deep, and a little wider, and as long as need be, in which green wood has previously been burned to coals. There the meat stays twelve hours--from midnight to noon next day, usually. It is basted steadily with <ingredient>salt water,</ingredient> applied with a clean mop, and turned over once only. Live coals are added as needed from the log fire kept burning a little way off. All this sounds simple, dead-easy. Try it--it is really an art. The plantation barbecuer was a person of consequence--moreover, few plantations could show a<pb n="274" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=278"/> master of the art. Such an one could give himself lordly airs--the loan of him was an act of special friendship--profitable always to the personage lent. Then as now there were free barbecuers, mostly white--but somehow their handiwork lacked a little of perfection. For one thing, they never found out the exact secret of "dipney," the sauce that savored the meat when it was crisply tender, brown all over, but free from the least scorching.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments" region="south"><p>Daddy made it thus: Two pounds <ingredient>sweet lard,</ingredient> melted in a brass kettle, with one pound beaten, not ground, <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> a pint of small fiery <ingredient>red peppers,</ingredient> nubbed and stewed soft in <ingredient>water</ingredient> to barely cover, a spoonful of <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> in powder--he would never tell what they were,--and a quart and pint of the strongest <ingredient>apple vinegar,</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> These were simmered together for half an hour, as the barbecue was getting done. Then a fresh, clean mop was dabbed lightly in the mixture, and as lightly smeared over the upper sides of the carcasses. Not a drop was permitted to fall on the coals--it would have sent up<pb n="275" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=279"/> smoke, and films of light ashes. Then, tables being set, the meat was laid, hissing hot, within clean, tight wooden trays, deeply gashed upon the side that had been next the fire, and deluged with the

which the mop-man smeared fully over it.</p></recipe>
<p>Hot! After eating it one wanted to lie down at the spring-side and let the water of it flow down the mouth. But of a flavor, a savor, a tastiness, nothing else earthly approaches. Not food for the gods, perhaps, but certainly meat for <emph rend="italic">men.</emph> Women loved it no less--witness the way they begged for a quarter of lamb or shoat or kid to take home. The proper accompaniments to barbecue are sliced cucumbers in strong vinegar, sliced tomatoes, a great plenty of salt-rising light bread--and a greater plenty of cool ripe watermelons, by way of dessert.</p><p>So much for barbecue edible. Barbecue, the occasion, has yet to be set forth. Its First Cause was commonly political--the old south loved oratory even better than the new. Newspapers were none so plenty--withal of scant circulation. Besides,<pb n="276" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=280"/> reading them was work--also tedious and tasteless. So the great and the would-be great, rode up and down, and roundabout, mixing with the sovereigns, and enlightening the world. Each party felt honor bound to gather the sovereigns so they might listen in comfort. Besides--they wanted amusement--a real big barbecue was a sort of social exchange, drawing together half of three counties, and letting you hear and tell, things new, strange, and startling. Furthermore, it was no trouble to get carcasses--fifty to a hundred was not uncommon. Men, women, children, everybody, indeed, came. The women brought bread and tablecloths, and commonly much beside. There was a speaker's stand, flag draped--my infant eyes first saw the Stars and Stripes floating above portraits--alleged--of Filmore and Buchanan, in the campaign of '56. That meant the barbecue was a joint affair--Whigs and Democrats getting it up, and both eagerly ready to whoop it up for their own speakers. Naturally in that latitude, Fremont was not even named. No court costume with a<pb n="277" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=281"/> tail three yards long, could to-day make me feel one-half so fine as the white jaconet, and green sash then sported.</p><p>It was said there were a thousand at the barbecue. The cheering, at its loudest, was heard two miles away. To me it seemed as though all the folk in the world had gathered in that shady grove--I remember wondering if there could possibly be so many watermelons, some would be left for the children. Four big wagon loads lay bobbing in the coolth of the spring branch. It was a very cold spring with mint growing beside it, as is common with springs thereabout. Early settlers planted it thus hard by the water--they built their houses high, and water got warm in carrying it up hill. Lacking ice houses, to have cool juleps, they had to be mixed right at the well-head. Sugar, spoons, goblets, and the jug, were easily carried down there.</p><p>Juleps were not mixed openly that day--but the speakers had pitchers full of something that seemed to refresh their eloquence, no less than themselves. They<pb n="278" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=282"/> hammered each other lustily, cheered to the echo by uproarious partisans, from nine in the morning until six in the afternoon. Luckily for them, there were four of them, thus they could "spell" each other--and the audience. I did not mind them--not in the least. How should I--when right in front of me sat a lady with the most gorgeous flowers upon her white chip bonnet, and one beside me, who insisted upon my wearing, until time to go home, her watch and chain!</p><p>The watermelons held out--we took two big ones home to Mother, also a lot of splendid Indian peaches, and a fore-quarter of lamb. Mother rarely went out, being an invalid--so folk vied with each other in sending her things. I mention it, only by way of showing there were things to be sent, even after feeding the multitude. The black people went away full fed, and full handed--nobody who carried a basket had much relish for taking home again any part of its contents.</p><p>Our countryside's cooking came to its full flower for the bran-dances--which<pb n="279" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=283"/> came into being, I think, because the pioneers liked to shake limber heels, but had not floors big enough for the shaking. So in green shade, at some springside they built an arbor of green boughs, leveled the earth underneath, pounded it hard and smooth, then covered it an inch deep with clean wheat bran, put up seats roundabout it, also a fiddlers' stand, got the fiddlers, printed invitations which went far and wide to women young and old, saw to a sufficiency of barbecue, depended on the Lord and the ladies for other things--and prepared to dance, dance from nine in the morning until two next morning. Men were not specifically invited--anybody in good standing with a clean shirt, dancing shoes, a good horse and a pedigree, was heartily welcome. The solid men, whose names appeared as managers, paid scot for everything--they left the actual arrangements to the lads. But they came in shoals to the bran-dances, and were audacious enough often to take away from some youth fathoms deep in love, his favorite partner. Sometimes, too, a lot of them<pb n="280" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=284"/> pre-empted all the prettiest girls, and danced a special set with them. Thus were they delivered into the hands of the oppressed--the lads made treaty with the fiddlers and prompter to play fast and furious--to call figures that kept the oldsters wheeling and whirling. It was an endurance contest--but victory did not always perch with the youths. Plenty of pursy gentlemen were still light enough on their feet, clear enough in their wind, to dance through Money Musk double, Chicken in the Bread Tray, and the Arkansaw Traveller, no matter what the time.</p><p>All dances were square--quadrilles and cotillions. The Basket Cotillion was indeed, looked upon as rather daring. You see, at the last, the ring of men linked by hand-hold outside a ring of their partners, lifted locked arms over their partners' heads, and thus interwoven, the circle balanced before breaking up. Other times, other dances--ours is now the day of the trot and the tango. But they lack the life, the verve of the old dances, the old tunes. To this day when I hear them, my feet patter<pb n="281" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=285"/> in spite of me. You could not dance to them steadily, with soft airs blowing all about, leaves flittering in sunshine, and water rippling near, without getting an appetite commensurate to the feasts in wait for you.</p><p>One basket from a plantation sufficed for bran-dances ending at sundown--those running on past midnight demanded two. It would never do to offer snippets and fragments for supper. Barbecue, if there were barbecue--was merely a concomitant of the feeding, not the whole thing. Part of it was left untouched to help out with supper. So were part of the melons, and much of the fruit. Apples, pears and peaches were plenty in good years--the near plantations sent them by wagon loads--as they also sent ice cream by freezerfuls, and <implement>boilers</implement> to make coffee. These were dispensed more than generously--but nobody would have helped himself to them uninvited, any more readily than he would have helped himself to money in the pocket. All that was in the baskets was spread on the general tables, but no man thought of eating<pb n="282" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=286"/> thereof, until all women and children had been served. Old men came next--the women generally forcing upon them the best of everything.</p><p>Such a best! Broiled chicken, fried chicken, in quantity, whole hams simply entreating to be sliced, barbecue, pickle in great variety, drained and sliced for eating, beaten biscuit, soda biscuit, egg bread, salt-rising bread, or rolls raised with hop-yeast--only a few attempted them--every manner of pie, tart, and tartlet that did not drip and mess things, all the cakes in the calendar of good housewifery--with, now and then, new ones specially invented. Even more than a wedding, a bran-dance showed and proved your quality as a cake-maker. Cakes were looked at in broad daylight, eaten not with cloyed finicky appetites, but with true zest. Woe and double woe to you if a loaf of pride showed at cutting a "sad" streak, not quite done. Joy untold if you were a raw young housekeeper, to have your cake acclaimed by eaters and critics.</p><p>Mammy, and other Mammies, moved<pb n="283" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=287"/> proudly about, each a sort of oracle to the friends of her household. They kept sharp eyes on things returnable--plates, platters, knives, spoons, and tablecloths--in any doubtful case, arising from the fact of similarity in pattern, they were the court of last resort. Spoons and so on are unmistakable--but one sprigged saucer is very like other saucers sprigged the same. It was the Mammies rather than the masters and mistresses, who ordered carriage drivers and horse boys imperiously about. But nobody minded the imperiousness--it was no day for quarrelling or unwisdom. And it would surely have been unwise to fret those who were the Keepers of the Baskets, at the very last.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south"><p>After dinner one went to the dressing-room, a wide roofless space enclosed with green boughs massed on end, and furnished plentifully with water in buckets, towels, basins, pin cushions, combs and brushes, face powder, even needles and thread. Thence one emerged after half an hour quite fresh--to dance on and on, till the fiddlers played a fast finale, and went to<pb n="284" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=288"/> their supper. Then came an interval of talk and laughing, of making new friends or stabbing delicately old enemies. Also and further much primping in the dressing-room. Dancing steadily through a temperature of 98 in the shade plays hob with some sorts of prettiness. But as dew fell and lighted lanterns went up about the arbor and throughout the grove, supper was very welcome. There was hot coffee for everybody, likewise milk, likewise lemonade, with buttered biscuit, chicken, ham, and barbecue. 
 
<purpose>Chicken-loaf</purpose>
was particularly good for such uses. To make it, several plump, tender, full-grown <ingredient>pullets</ingredient> were simmered in <ingredient>water</ingredient> to barely cover them, with a few <ingredient>pepper corns,</ingredient> half a dozen <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> and a blade of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> until very, very tender. Then the meat was picked from the bones, cut up while still hot, packed down in something deep, seasoning it to taste with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> as it was packed, and dusting in more <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> if needed, then the liquor which had been kept at a brisk boil was poured over, and left to cool. No bother about skimming off fat--we liked<pb n="285" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=289"/> our loaf rich as well as high-flavored. It came out a fine mottled solid that could be sliced thin, and eaten delicately between the halves of a buttered biscuit. Sandwiches were known--but only in books. Which was well--they would have dried out so badly, for this was before the era of wax paper. Since everything was packed in the baskets whole, there was much work for mothers and Mammies at the unpacking and table-setting.</p></recipe>
<p>Tarts, especially if filled with cheesecake or jelly custard, held high place among the sweets. Especially with the men, young and old. One, a manager, who had been here, there, everywhere, since eight o'clock in the morning, asked Mammy at suppertime to: "Please save him one more dozen of them little pies." In truth the little pies made no more than a mouthful for noble appetites. Pies, full-grown, did not go begging--and were seldom cut in less than quarters. Frosted cake--which the lads denominated "white-washed," was commonly saved over for the supper baskets. It kept moist, whereas<pb n="286" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=290"/> without the frosting a long summer day might make it hard.</p><p>After the supper elderly men drove home--unless they had daughters among the dancers without other chaperons. Generally, some aunt or cousin stood ready with such good offices. The chaperons themselves danced now and then--youths specially anxious for favor with their charges, all but forced them upon the floor. Set it to their credit, they footed it almost as lightly as the youngest. Occasionally you might see, mother and daughter, even a granddaughter of tender years, wheeling and balancing in the same set. And so the fiddles played, the stars shone, the waters babbled, until the lanterns flared and sputtered out, and the banjo-picker held up fingers raw and bleeding. Then with a last final swing and flourish, everybody scattered for homeward ways, glad of the day's pleasure--and tired enough to be glad also it was ended.</p><p>The most special of occasions was a dining. Not upon any high day or holiday, such as Christmas, New Year, Jackson's<pb n="287" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=291"/> Day--the eighth of January--Easter nor Whit-Monday, but as Mammy said: "A dinin' des, dry so." Commonly pride of housewifery incited to it--therefore it must be a triumph. The hour was two o'clock, but guests came around eleven or twelve--and spent the day. They sat down to tables that well might have groaned, even howled, such was the weight they carried. Twelve was a favorite guest-number--few tables could be stretched to hold more than twelve plates. There were but two courses--dinner and dessert--unless in very cold weather, some person who would nowadays be said to be fond of putting on frills, set before her guests, plates of steaming soup. It had to smell very good, else it was no more than tasted--folk did not care to dull the edge of appetite needlessly, with so much before them. For the table was fully set--a stuffed ham at one end, a chicken or partridge pie at the other, side dishes of smothered rabbit, or broiled chicken, at least four kinds of sweet pickle, as many of jelly and sour pickle, a castor full of catsups, tomato and<pb n="288" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=292"/> walnut, plain vinegar, pepper vinegar, red and black pepper, and made mustard, all the vegetables in season--I have seen corn pudding, candied sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, mashed and baked, black-eyed peas, baked peaches, apples baked in sugar and cloves, cabbage boiled with bacon, okra, stewed tomatoes, sliced raw tomatoes, cucumbers cut up with young onions, beets boiled and buttered, and string beans, otherwise snaps, all at one spread.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>Only epicures dressed their

at table. One cranky old family friend had it served to him in a water bucket, set beside him on the floor.

Still the hostess had the satisfaction of feeling she had offered it--that she had indeed offered more than could have been reasonably expected.</variation></p></recipe>
<p>There was water to drink, also cider in season, also milk, sweet and sour, and the very best of the homemade wine. Decanters of it sat up and down the table--you could fill up and come again at pleasure. The one drawback was--it was hard to eat properly, when you were so interrupted by helpings to something else. If there was a fault in our old-time cooking, it was its lack of selection. I think those who gave dinings felt uneasy if there was unoccupied room for one more dish.</p><p>Dessert was likewise an embarrassment of riches. Cakes in variety, two sorts of pie, with ice cream or sherbet, or fresh fruit, did not seem too much to those dear Ladies Bountiful. There was no after-dinner coffee. In cold weather coffee in big cups, with cream and sugar, often went with the main dinner. Hot apple toddies preceded it at such times. In hot weather the precursor was mint julep, ice cold.<pb n="290" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=294"/> Yet we were not a company of dyspeptics nor drunkards--by the free and full use of earth's abounding mercies we learned not to abuse them.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame" region="south" occasion="birthday"><p><purpose rend="italic">Birthday Barbecue:</purpose>
<attribution>(Dorothy Dix.)</attribution> As refined gold can be gilded, barbecue, common, or garden variety, can take on extra touches. As thus: Kill and dress quickly a fine yearling <ingredient>wether,</ingredient> in prime condition but not over-fat, sluice out with cool <ingredient>water,</ingredient> wipe dry inside and out with a soft, damp cloth, then while still hot, fill the carcass cram-full of fresh <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> the tenderer and more lush the better, close it, wrap tight in a clean cloth wrung very dry from cold <ingredient>salt water,</ingredient> then pop all into a clean, bright tin <implement>lard stand,</implement> with a tight-fitting top, put on top securely, and sink the stand head over ears in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient>--a spring if possible. Do this around dusk and leave in <ingredient>water</ingredient> until very early morning. Build fire in trench of hard wood logs before two o'clock. Let it burn to coals--have a log fire some little way off to supply fresh coals at need. Lay a breadth of galvanized chicken-wire--large<pb n="291" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=295"/> mesh--over the trench. Take out carcass--split it half down back bone, lay it flesh side down, on the wire grid, taking care coals are so evenly spread there is no scorching. After an hour begin basting with "the sop." It is made thus. Best <ingredient>butter</ingredient> melted, one pound, <ingredient>black pepper</ingredient> ground, quarter pound, <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> pods, freed of stalk and cut fine to almost a paste, half a pint, strong <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> scant pint, <ingredient>brandy, peach if possible though apple or grape will answer,</ingredient> half a pint. Cook all together over very slow heat or in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> for fifteen minutes. The sop must not scorch, but the seasoning must be cooked through it. Apply with a big soft swab made of clean old linen, but not old enough to fray and string. Baste meat constantly. Put over around four in the morning, the barbecue should be done, and well done, by a little after noon. There should be enough sop left to serve as gravy on portions after it is helped. The meat, turned once, has a fine crisped surface, and is flavored all through with the <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> and seasoning.</p></recipe>

<formula class="household" region="south"><p><purpose>Dip-candles</purpose>
I never saw in common use--but Mammy showed me how they were made back at Ole Marster's, in the days when candle-molds were not to be had. Dipped or molded, the candles were of varying substance. <variation><purpose>Tallow</purpose>
was the main reliance--<ingredient>mutton tallow</ingredient> as well as that from our beeves. It was tried out fresh, and hardened with <ingredient>alum</ingredient> in the process. The <ingredient>alum</ingredient> was dissolved in a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and put with the raw <ingredient>fat</ingredient> as it went over the fire. By and by the <ingredient>water</ingredient> all cooked away, leaving the <ingredient>alum</ingredient> well incorporated through the clear <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> Lacking it, a little<pb n="293" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=297"/> clear <ingredient>lye</ingredient> went in--Mammy thought and said, the <ingredient>lye</ingredient> ate up the oil in the <ingredient>tallow,</ingredient> making it firmer and whiter. But <ingredient>lye</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum</ingredient> could not go in at the same time, since being alkaline and acid, they would destroy each other.</variation></p><p>Great pains were taken not to scorch the <ingredient>tallow</ingredient>--that meant smelly and ill-colored candles. After straining it clear of cracklings, it was caked in something deep, then turned out and laid on the highest shelf in the lumber house to await molding time. Cakes of <ingredient>beeswax</ingredient> were kept in the <implement>Jackson press,</implement> so children, white and black, could not take bites for chewing. It ranked next to native sweet gum for such uses--but Mammy felt it had much better be saved to mix with the <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> at melting time. It made the candles much firmer, also bettered their light, and moreover changed the <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> hue to an agreeable very pale yellow. Bee hives, like much else, were to a degree primitive--the wax came from comb crushed in the straining of honey. It was boiled in <ingredient>water</ingredient> to take away the remnant sweetness, then<pb n="294" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=298"/> allowed to cool on top the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> taken off, and remelted over clean <ingredient>water,</ingredient> so manipulated as to free it from foreign substances, then molded into cakes. <variation>One cake was always set apart for the neighborhood cobbler, who melted it with <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> and <ingredient>rosin</ingredient> to make 
 
<purpose>shoemaker's wax.</purpose></variation> Another moiety was turned into grafting wax--by help of it one orchard tree bore twelve manners of fruit. And still another, a small, pretty cake from a scalloped patty pan, found place in the family work basket--in sewing by hand with flax thread, unless you waxed it, it lost strength, and quickly pulled to pieces.</p><p>We bought our flax thread in skeins, but Mammy loved to tell of spinning it back in the days when she was young, and the best spinner on the old plantation. She still spun shoe-thread for her friend the cobbler, who, however, furnished her the raw flax, which he had grown, rotted and hechtelled, in his bit of bottom land. There were still spinning and weaving in plenty at our house--Mother had made, yearly,<pb n="295" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=299"/> jeans, linsey, carpets and so on--but the plantation was not wholly clothed with homespun, as had been the case in her father's house.</p><p>Return we to our candle-making. It was work for the very coldest weather--even though we had two sets of molds, needs must the candles harden quickly if the making was to speed well. Molds could be filled at the kitchen hearth, then set outside to cool. For dipping the <ingredient>tallow</ingredient>-pot had to be set over an outside fire, and neighbored by a ladder, laid flat on trestles with smooth boards laid underneath. Mammy spun the candle wicks--from <ingredient>long-staple cotton,</ingredient> drawing it out thick, and twisting it barely enough to hold together. It must not be too coarse, as it had to be doubled over reeds at top, either for molding or dipping.</p><p>The molds were of candle-shape, joined in batteries of six or twelve, with a pert handle at one side, and tiny holes at the tips, through which the wick-ends were thrust, by help of a long broom-straw. Well in place they were drawn taut, the<pb n="296" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=300"/> reeds so placed as to hold the wicks centrally, then <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> melted with <ingredient>beeswax,</ingredient> in due proportion, was poured around till the molds were brim full--after which they were plunged instantly into a tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> standing outside. This to prevent oozings from the tip--hot grease is the most insidious of all substances. Only in zero weather would the first oozings harden enough to plug the orifice quickly. When the candles had hardened properly, the mold was either held over the fire, or thrust in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> half a minute, then the candles withdrawn by help of the reeds. They were cooled a bit, to save the softened outside, then nubbed of surplus wick, and laid in a dish outside. Careless or witless molders, by laying candles still soft upon the pile, often made themselves double work.</p><p><ingredient>Tallow</ingredient> for dipping, was kept barely fluid, by setting it over embers a little way off the fire. The pot had to be deep, so the wicks could be sunk in it to full length. They were thus sunk by stickfuls, lifted up quickly, and hung between the ladder rungs<pb n="297" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=301"/> to drip. Half the <ingredient>tallow</ingredient> on them dripped away--indeed, after the first dipping they looked little more than clotted ghosts of themselves in their last estate. In very cold weather three drippings sufficed--otherwise there must be four or five. Since the dip was the result of cooled accretions, it was always top-heavy--much bigger at the nose than the base. A quick and skilled worker, though, could dip a hundred candles in the time required to mold two dozen. They burned out so quickly that was a crowning mercy--half a dozen was the average of a long winter evening. Further they ran down, in great masses--hence the importance of saving up drippings. Even molded candles made them plentiful enough to be worth re-molding. This unless discolored with the brass of candlesticks--in that case their last end was soap grease.</p><p><variation><purpose>Rush lights </purpose>
were dips--this I state on information and belief, since I never saw one. Also on information and belief, it is here set forth, that folk in the back countries where wicking was not easily<pb n="298" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=302"/> had, used instead of wicks, <ingredient>splinters of fat pine, known as light wood.</ingredient> In proof, take Candle Wood Mountain, whose name is said to have come from furnishing such fat pine, and of a special excellence. The <ingredient>pine splinters</ingredient> must, I think, have given a better light than real wicks--my father, in Tennessee, never ceased sighing for the lightwood, which had made such cheery illumination back in his boyhood, in a Carolina home.</variation></p></formula>
<p>Every sort of waste fat became at the last, soap grease. Bones even were thrown into kettles of lye, which ate out all their richness, leaving them crumbly, and fit for burying about the grapevines. Hence the appositeness of the darkey saying, to express special contempt of a suitor: "My Lawd! I wouldn't hab dat nigger, not eben for soap grease." Which has always seemed to me, in a way, a classic of condemnation.</p>
<formula class="household" region="south"><p><purpose>Soap</purpose>
making came twice a year--the main event in March, to get free of things left over from hog killing, the supplement in September or October, to use up summer<pb n="299" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=303"/> savings. Each was preceded by dripping lye. This necessitated <ingredient>wood ashes,</ingredient> of course--<ingredient>ashes from green wood.</ingredient> <ingredient>Oak</ingredient> or <ingredient>hickory</ingredient> was best. They were kept dry until they went into <implement>hoppers,</implement> where they were rotted by gentle wetting for a space of several days. Then <ingredient>water</ingredient> was dripped through, coming out a dark brown caustic liquid, clean-smelling, but ill to handle--it would eat a finger-tip carelessly thrust in it to the raw.</p><p>But even thus it was not strong enough for proper soapmaking, so it was boiled, boiled, until it would eat a feather, merely drawn quickly through it. <ingredient>Grease</ingredient> was added then, a little at a time, and stirred well through, changing the black-brown <ingredient>lye</ingredient> into a light-brown, bubbly mass. Whatever the <ingredient>lye</ingredient> would not eat of the grease's components, was skimmed out with the big perforated ladle. Even beyond candle-molding, soap-making was an art. Mammy never would touch it, until "the right time of the moon." Also and further, she used a sassafras stick for stirring, put it in the first time with her<pb n="300" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=304"/> right hand, and always stirred the kettle the same way. If a left-handed person came near the kettle she was mightily vexed--being sure her soap would go wrong. She kept on the fire beside it a smaller kettle of clear <ingredient>lye,</ingredient> to be added at need, without checking the boiling.</p><p>Boiling down <ingredient>lye</ingredient> took one day, boiling in <ingredient>grease</ingredient> another. The third morning, after the fire was well alight, she tested the soap, by making a bit into lather. If the lather were clean and clear, without a film of grease on top, she knew it remained only to cook the soap down thick enough for the barrel, or to make into balls by the addition of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> But if the film appeared--then indeed there was trouble. First aid to it was more <ingredient>lye,</ingredient> of feather-eating strength--next a fresh sassafras stirring stick, last and most important, walking backwards as she put the stick in the kettle, though she would never admit she did this on purpose. Like the most of her race she was invincibly shy about acknowledging her beliefs in charms and conjuring.</p><p>Soap which failed to thicken properly<pb n="301" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=305"/> lacked <ingredient>grease.</ingredient> To put in enough, yet not too much, was a matter of nice judgment. <variation><ingredient>Tallow</ingredient> did not mix well with hog fat. Therefore it had commonly its smaller special pot, whose results were molded for 
 
<purpose>hand-soap,</purpose>
being hard and rather light-colored.</variation></p><p>Since our washerwomen much preferred soft soap, most of the spring making went straight into the barrel. The barrel had to be very tight--soap has nearly as great a faculty of creeping through seams as even hot lard. One kettleful, however, would have <ingredient>salt</ingredient> stirred through it, then be allowed to cool, and be cut out in long bars, which were laid high and dry to age. Old soap was much better for washing fine prints, lawns, ginghams and so on--in fact whatever needed cleansing without fading.</p><p>Sundry other fine soap makers emptied their salted soap, just as it was on the point of hardening, into shallow pans, cloth-lined, and shaped it with bare hands into balls the size of two fists. This they did with the whole batch, holding hard soap so much easier kept, and saying it was no<pb n="302" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=306"/> trouble whatever to soften a ball in a little hot water upon wash days. But Mammy would have none of such practices--said give her good soft soap and sand rock, she could scour anything. Sand rock was a variety of limestone, which burning made crumbly, but did not turn to lime. Mammy picked it up wherever she found it, beat it fine and used it on everything--shelves, floors, <implement>hollow-ware,</implement> <implement>milk pans,</implement> <implement>piggins,</implement> cedar water buckets--it made their brass hoops shine like gold. While she scoured she told us tales of the pewter era--when she had gone, a barefoot child, with her mother, to the Rush Branch, to come home with a sheaf of rushes, whereby the pewter was made to shine. It hurts even yet, recalling the last end of that pewter. As glass and crockery grew plenty, the boys--my uncles, there were five of them--melted it down for rifle bullets, when by chance they ran out of lead. Yet--who am I, to reproach them--did not I myself, melt down for a purpose less legitimate a fine Brittania ware teapot, whose only<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=307"/> fault was a tiny leak? Now I should prize it beyond silver and gold.</p></formula>
<formula class="household" region="south"><p>Harking back to candle-making--we had no <ingredient>candle-berries</ingredient> in our wilds, and only a few <ingredient>wax-berries</ingredient> as ornaments of our gardens. But from what I know by observation and experience, the <ingredient>candle-berries</ingredient> or <ingredient>bayberries,</ingredient> can be melted in <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> the same as honey-comb, and the wax strained away from the seedy residue, then allowed to cool, on top the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and clarified by a further melting and cooling over <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Mixed with <ingredient>paraffine</ingredient> it can be molded into real 
 
<purpose>bayberry candles,</purpose>
ever so much more odorous than those of commerce. It is well to remember in buying <ingredient>paraffine</ingredient> that there are three qualities of it, differing mainly in the degree of heat at which they melt. Choose that which is hardest to melt for candle-making. One might indeed, experiment with bayberry wax, and the drippings of plain paraffine candles, before undertaking candle-making to any considerable extent.</p></formula>
<pb n="304" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dish&#38;PageNum=308"/><p>At last word. If any incline to challenge things here set forth, will they please remember that as one star differs from another in glory, so does one family, one region, differ from all others in its manners of eating, drinking, and cooking. I have written true things, but make no claim that they apply all over. Indeed there may be those to whom they will seem a transversing of wisdom and experience. To all such I say, try them intelligently, with pains and patience, and of the results, hold fast to that you find good.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a candlestick on a candle holder, burned to a stub, and recently snuffed.</description></illustration></chapter>
