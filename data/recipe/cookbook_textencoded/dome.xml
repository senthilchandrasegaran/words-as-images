<p>THIS Work having passed through two editions, and having met with a very favorable reception, the Authoress has been induced to thoroughly revise and re-arrange the whole work. Numerous additions have also been made, particularly under the heads Miscellaneous Receipts and Hints to Young Housekeepers, which she hopes will be found to have enhanced its value.</p>

<hd align="center">INTRODUCTORY ADDRESS.</hd>
<p>THE compiler of "Useful Receipts and Hints to Young Housekeepers" having entered early in life upon a train of duties, was frequently embarrassed by her ignorance of domestic affairs. For, whilst receipt books for elegant preparations were often seen, those connected with the ordinary, but far more useful part of household duties, were not easily procured; thus situated, she applied to persons of experience, and embodied the information collected in a book, to which, since years have matured her judgment, she has added much that is the result of her own experiments.</p>
<p>Familiar, then, with the difficulties a young housekeeper encounters, when she finds herself in reality the mistress of an establishment, the Authoress offers to her young countrywomen this Work, with the belief that, by attention to its contents, many of the
<pb n="viii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=12"/>
cares attendant on a country or city life, may materially lessened; and hoping that the directions are such as to be understood by the most inexperienced, it is respectfully dedicated to those who feel an interest in domestic affairs.</p>

In boiling fresh <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> care is necessary to have the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boiling all the time it is in the pot; if the pot is not well scummed, the appearance of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will be spoiled.</p>

should always be well done.</variation> <variation>A <purpose><alt synonym1="boiled round of beef">round of beef</alt></purpose>

that is stuffed, will take more than three hours to boil, and if not stuffed, two hours or more, according to the size; slow boiling is the best.</variation> <variation>A leg of <purpose><alt synonym1="boiled mutton">mutton</alt></purpose>

requires from two to three hours boiling, according to the size; a fore-quarter from an hour to an hour and a half; a quarter of <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> unless very large, will boil in an hour.</variation> <variation><purpose><alt synonym1="boiled veal" synonym2="boiled pork">Veal and pork</alt></purpose>

will take rather longer to boil than mutton.</variation></p>
<p>All boiled fresh <ingredient>meat</ingredient> should have <ingredient>drawn butter</ingredient> poured over it, after it is dished, and be garnished with <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient></p>
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=14"/>
<p>The liquor that fresh meat, or poultry, is boiled in should be saved, as an addition of vegetables, herbs and dumplings make a nourishing soup of it.</p>
<p><variation>A large <purpose><alt synonym1="boiled turkey">turkey</alt></purpose>

will take three hours to boil--a small one half that time; secure the legs to keep them from bursting out; <ingredient>turkeys</ingredient> should be blanched in warm <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water;</ingredient> stuff them and rub their breasts with <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> flour a cloth and pin them in.</variation> <variation>A large <purpose><alt synonym1="boiled chicken">chicken</alt></purpose>

that is stuffed should boil an hour, and small ones half that time.</variation> The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should always boil before you put in your <ingredient>meat</ingredient> or poultry. When <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is frozen soak it in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for several hours, and allow more time in the cooking.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Boil a Turkey.</purpose>

</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Boil Beef Tongue, Corned Beef, &amp;c.</purpose>

If the <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> is dry, let it soak for several hours put it to boil in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and keep it boiling slowly
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=15"/>
for two hours; but if it is just out of the pickle, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> should boil when it goes in.</p>
<p><variation><ingredient>Corned or pickled beef, or pork,</ingredient> requires longer boiling than that which is dry; you can tell when it is done by the bones coming out easily. Pour <ingredient>drawn butter</ingredient> over it when dished.</variation></p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Boil a Ham.</purpose>

A large <ingredient>ham</ingredient> should boil three or four hours very slowly; it should be put in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and be kept covered during the whole process; a small <ingredient>ham</ingredient> will boil in two hours. <variation>All <purpose><alt synonym1="boiled bacon">bacon</alt></purpose>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Roasting Meat.</purpose>

Roasting either meat or poultry requires more attention than boiling or stewing; it is very important to baste it frequently; and if the meat has been frozen, it should have time to thaw before cooking. <ingredient>Beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> or <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> that is roasted in a stove or oven, requires more <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dredged on it than when cooked before the fire in a <implement>tin kitchen.</implement> There should be but little <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the <implement>dripping pan,</implement> as that steams the meat and prevents its browning; it is best to add more as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> evaporates, and where there is plenty of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the meat it incorporates with the gravy and it requires no thickening; add a little <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> before you take up the gravy. Meat that has been hanging up some time should be roasted in preference to boiling, as the fire extracts any taste it may have acquired. To rub fresh meat with salt and pepper will prevent the flies from troubling it, and will make it keep longer.</p>

<p>As bread is the most important article of food, great care is necessary in making it, and much judgment, as the weather changes so often.</p>
<p>In warm weather, the rising should be mixed with water nearly cold; if there should be a spell of damp weather in the summer, have it slightly warm and set it to rise on a table in the kitchen.</p>
<p>In winter it should be mixed with warm water, and left on the warm hearth all night. If the yeast is fresh, a small quantity will do; if several weeks old,
<pb n="58" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=62"/>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">To Bake in a Brick Oven.</hd>
<p>If you have a large family, or board the laborers of a farm, it is necessary to have a <implement>brick oven,</implement> so as to bake but twice a week; and to persons that understand the management of them, it is much the easiest way.</p>
<p>If you arrange every thing with judgment, half a dozen loaves of bread, as many pies or puddings, rusk, rolls or biscuit may be baked at the same time. Some persons knead up their bread over night in winter; to do this, the sponge should be made up at four o'clock in the afternoon. If you wish to put corn flour in your bread, scald one quart of it to six loaves, and work it in the flour that you are going to stir in the rising; to make six loaves of bread, you should have three quarts of water and a tea-cup of yeast.</p>
<p>Scalded corn flour, or boiled mashed potatoes, assists bread to rise very much in cold weather. Have a quart of potatoes well boiled and rolled fine with a rolling-pin on your cake board; mix them well in the rising after it is light; if the oven is not ready, move the bread to a cool place. If the bread is sour before you mould it out, mix a heaped tea-spoonful of sal&#230;ratus in a little water; spread out the bread on the board, dust a little flour on it, and spread the sal&#230;ratus and water over, and work it well through. This quite takes away the sour taste, but if the bread is made of good lively yeast,
<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=64"/>
it seldom requires it; let it rise in the pans about half an hour. Many persons that make their own bread, are in the constant practice of using sal&#230;ratus, putting in the rising for six loaves a heaped tea-spoonful, dissolved in a little warm water; in this there is no disadvantage, and it insures sweet bread, and will also answer in making rolls or light cakes.</p>
<p>Common sized loaves will bake in an hour in the <implement>brick oven.</implement> If they slip easily in the pans, and, upon breaking a little piece from the side, it rises from the pressure of the finger, it is done; but if it should not rise, put it back again; when the bread is taken out of the oven, wrap it in a cloth till quite cold.</p>
<p>You should have a large tin vessel with holes in the top, to keep bread in; in this way, it will be moist at the end of the week in cool weather.</p>
<p>Coarse brown flour or middlings makes very sweet light bread, by putting in scalded corn meal, say, to two loaves, half a pint, and is also good to use for breakfast made as buckwheat cakes.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Directions for Heating a Brick Oven, &amp;c.</hd>
<p>It is very important to have good oven-wood split fine, and the oven filled with it as soon as the baking is out; by this precaution it is always ready and dry. Early in the morning, take out half of the wood, and spread the remainder over the oven, in such a way as it will take fire easily; light a few sticks in the fire, and put them in; when it burns well, turn the wood about, and occasionally add more till it is all in; when it is burnt to coals, stir them about well with a long-handled shovel made for the purpose.</p>
<p>When it looks bright on the top and sides, it is hot enough; let the coals lay all over the bottom till near
<pb n="61" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=65"/>
the time of putting in the bread, when draw them to the mouth, as it is apt to get cool the quickest. If you have biscuit to bake, put some of the coals on one side near the front, as they require a quick heat, and should be put in immediately after the coals are taken out; they will bake in fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>
<p>When all the coals are taken out, if the bottom of the oven sparkles, it is very hot, and should wait a few minutes; but if not, you may put in the bread first, and then the pies; if you have a plain rice pudding to bake, it should be put in the middle of the front, and have two or three shovels of coals put round it, if the oven is rather cool. Close the oven with a wooden stopper made to fit it; after they have been in a few minutes, see that they do not brown too fast; if so, keep the stopper down a little while. Pies made of green fruit will bake in three-quarters of an hour; but if the fruit has been stewed, half an hour will be long enough.</p>
<p>Rusk, or rolls, take about half an hour to bake in a <implement>brick oven;</implement> if you should have to open the oven very often before the bread is done, put in a few shovels of coals and shut it up.</p>
<p>When all is taken out, fill the oven with wood ready for the next baking.</p>
<p>There is nothing in any department of cooking that gives more satisfaction to a young housekeeper than to have accomplished what is called a good baking.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">General Remarks on making Bread of Indian Corn Meal.</hd>
<p>A wooden spoon with a long handle, is the best for stirring and mixing the bread or cakes. It requires more salt than other bread, and should be well mixed or beaten. If it is mixed over night, it should generally be done with cold water, and set in the cellar or some cool place in summer; in winter it requires rather a warmer place to stand. It sours more easily than
<pb n="78" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=82"/>
bread made of other flour. In the morning, if you find that it is at all acid, dissolve half a tea-spoonful of sal&#230;ratus in warm water, and stir it just before it is put to bake. Where milk is used, it should be baked immediately, and the richer the milk, the more palatable it is. Whatever you bake this bread in, should be well greased first, as it is more apt to adhere to the oven than some other kinds of flour. It should bake with a quick heat.</p>
<p>When you buy sal&#230;ratus, pound it fine, put it in a wide-mouthed bottle, and cork it tight. Some persons keep it dissolved in water, but you cannot judge of the strength of it so well.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Remarks on Making and Baking Cake.</hd>
<p>THE materials for making cake should be of the best quality, as your success very much depends on it. Flour should be dried and sifted, sugar rolled fine, spices pounded and sifted. Where brown sugar is used, it should be spread on a dish and dried before rolling it. I have known very good pound cake made with brown sugar; also jumbles, &amp;c. Persons

that make their own butter sometimes use it fresh from the churn, which prevents the necessity of washing the salt out of it for cake, and it mixes more readily than hard butter. Currants should be picked over, washed and dried; raisins should be stemmed and stoned. When these preparations are made the day before, it is a great assistance. Eggs should be fresh, or they will not beat light: in beating the whites, take a broad flat dish, and beat them until you can hold the dish upside down;--this is a test of their lightness. A large bowl is best for mixing and beating cake. You must use your hand for mixing the sugar and butter, and as you add the other ingredients, you may take a large wooden spoon; beat it some time after all is mixed. The oven should be ready to bake immediately, as standing makes cake heavy. A <implement>brick oven</implement> is the most certain,--and over your pans of cake, you should spread several layers of newspaper, to prevent its browning too suddenly. Cake requires more time than bread: a large cake should stay in the oven from an hour and a half to two hours, turning and looking at it from time to time; when you think it is sufficiently baked, stick a broad bright knife in the centre; if it is dry and free from dough when drawn out, the cake is likely to be done, though sometimes this is not a certain test, and you will have to draw a little from the centre of the cake with the knife. A broom straw will sometimes answer in a small cake instead of a knife. A large stone pan, with a cover, is the best for keeping cake, or a large covered bowl.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Make Cider.</purpose>

To make cider that will keep sweet for a length of time, requires particular attention to all the points. All the works and utensils in use must be perfectly clean, so that nothing acid shall come in contact with the pulp or liquor while pressing. The <implement>casks</implement> should be cleaned in the following manner:</p>
<p>After washing each barrel clean, put in a lump of unslacked lime, and pour in a gallon of boiling water; bung it up, and roll the barrel several times a day,
<pb n="154" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=158"/>
letting it lay with the bung down; in the evening, empty out the lime-water, and wash the barrel clean in several waters; after the water is drained out, burn a brimstone match in it, made of a piece of coarse muslin one inch broad, and four long, dipped in melted brimstone; light one end of the match, and put it in; put the bung on slightly, so as to hold the other end, and allow air sufficient to make it burn; when the rag has burned out, drive in the bung to keep in the sulphuric gas, which, if allowed time, will condense on the sides.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>apples</ingredient> should be kept under cover, and secured from rain. After they have laid to mellow for two or three weeks, select those that are sound; break off the stems and leaves; have the trough perfectly clean, and after they are ground, keep them from the sun and rain for twenty-four hours; then press them, and fill into the <implement>casks;</implement> the first running is always the best; each <implement>cask</implement> that is filled should be numbered, so as to know the quality; and after they are all filled, draw off and mix them, the weak with the strong; keep the <implement>casks</implement> filled up with <ingredient>cider</ingredient> while they are fermenting; when the fermentation is subsiding, there will be a thin white scum rise slowly: when this is all off, lay on the bung lightly; rack it off in a few days in barrels, in which brimstone has been used, and bung it tight; rack it off again in March, and keep the bungs in tight.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Make Vinegar.</purpose>

You may always have good <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> for pickling, and other purposes, by taking a little pains. Get a tight <implement>whiskey barrel,</implement> if it is clean you need not rinse it, and out into it ten gallons of the best <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> you can
<pb n="155" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=159"/>
procure, with one quart of <ingredient>whiskey</ingredient> and one quart of <ingredient>molasses;</ingredient> every day for a week, add a gallon of good <ingredient>cider</ingredient> that has not been watered, and shake the barrel each time; let it stand in this state two weeks, shaking the barrel frequently. After this, you may put in a gallon of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> occasionally, with any that has been left at table, or the <ingredient>settlings of decanters or bottles that have had wine in,</ingredient> but do not put in any water. It will make much sooner in the garret or a warm place, but if the barrel is fixed early in the summer, you will have plenty to pickle with in the fall; taste it so as not to add <ingredient>cider</ingredient> too fast. Have a <implement>phial</implement> with a string attached to it that you can put in at the bung. You should have a barrel of good hard <ingredient>cider</ingredient> before you begin to make <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient> If you are in want of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> fill a jug from the barrel, and set it in the hot sun, where it will turn sour much quicker. It is a good plan to keep a jug in a closet, where you can empty all the slops of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> and <ingredient>wine;</ingredient> and when you get it full, empty it in the barrel.</p>
<p>After the pickling is done, you can put as much <ingredient>hard cider</ingredient> in the barrel, a gallon at a time, as you have taken out, with a little <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and half a pint of <ingredient>whiskey;</ingredient> if you put too much of the latter it will prevent it from getting sour, but a little gives strength to the <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> increases the acidity, and helps to color it. If you should have any <ingredient>juice of cherries, currants, or blackberries,</ingredient> put it in, or if you can get cheap <ingredient>sour raisins,</ingredient> they will be an improvement to the flavor of the vinegar; a tea-cup of <ingredient>burnt sugar</ingredient> will give it a good color.</p>
<p>Vinegar made in this way will keep <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> good for several years. If the cider has not sufficient strength it will take longer to make.</p>

To two gallons of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> put one pound of <ingredient>ginger,</ingredient> quarter of a pound of <ingredient>black pepper,</ingredient> two ounces of <ingredient>red pepper,</ingredient> two of <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> a tea-cup of <ingredient>celery seed,</ingredient> a pint of <ingredient>horse-radish,</ingredient> a pint of <ingredient>mustard seed,</ingredient> a few <ingredient>onions</ingredient> or <ingredient>garlic,</ingredient> and three ounces of <ingredient>turmeric</ingredient> to turn them yellow. The above ingredients should be mixed together in a jar, and set in the sun by the first of July, tied up close, with a block over each jar to keep out the rain.

An experienced housekeeper has furnished the following method for curing and drying <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> which will keep good for two years, without being injured by must or fly, and is much admired. Have the rounds divided, leaving a piece of the sinew to hang up by; lay the pieces in a tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for an hour; then rub each piece of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> that will weigh fifteen or twenty pounds, with a handful of <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> pulverized, and a pint of <ingredient>fine salt;</ingredient> sprinkle <ingredient>fine salt</ingredient> in the bottom of a clean tight barrel, and lay the pieces in, strewing a little <ingredient>coarse salt</ingredient> between each piece; let it lay two days; then make the brine in a clean tub, with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and ground <ingredient>alum salt</ingredient>--stir it well; it must be strong enough to bear an egg half up; put in half a pound of best <ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> to each gallon of the <ingredient>salt and water;</ingredient> pour it over the <ingredient>beef;</ingredient> put a clean large stone on the top of the meat to keep it under the pickle, (which is very important;) put a cover on the barrel; examine it occasionally to see that the pickle does not leak,--and if it should need more, add of the same strength; let it stand six weeks, when hang it up in the smoke-house, and after it has drained, smoke it moderately for ten days; it should then hang in a dry place; before cooking, let it soak for twenty-four hours: a piece that weighs fifteen or twenty pounds should boil two hours--one half the size, one hour, and a small piece should soak six or twelve

<hd align="center">BUTTER, CHEESE, COFFEE, TEA, &amp;c.</hd>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Butter.</purpose>

IT is of the first importance that every thing connected with milk and butter should be kept clean; if the milk acquires an unpleasant taste, it communicates it to the butter. Tin pans are best to keep milk in, and they should be painted on the outside to keep them from rusting when they are put in water.</p>
<p>In summer, <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be kept as cool as possible; before it is strained, the pans and strainer should be rinsed with cold water, and the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> not covered until it is cold; as soon as the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> rises sufficiently, it should be skimmed, and put in a large tin bucket with
<pb n="177" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=181"/>
a lid that fits down tight, and stirred every day. Butter will be spoiled by neglecting to stir the <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> a yellow scum will form on it, which gives it an unpleasant taste. And if you leave a pan of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> till the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is covered with spots of mould, you had better throw it away than put it in, as it will spoil the taste of a whole churning.</p>
<p>If you have no way of keeping your <ingredient>cream</ingredient> cool in hot weather, it ought to be churned twice a week; the earlier in the morning the better. Always put <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in your churn the night before you use it, and change it in the morning just before you put in the <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> When the butter is gathering, take off the lid of the churn to let the heated air escape, and move it gently; have your <implement>butter-ladle</implement> and pan scalded and cooled; take out the butter and work it till all the milk is out; scrape some lumps of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and work in; cover it up, and set away in a cool place till the next morning, when work it again.</p>
<p>If you have neither an ice, or <implement>spring-house,</implement> a box by the side of the pump, with a cover over it, is very convenient to put cream and butter down the well; put them in tin kettles with covers to fit tight, and fasten them to strong tarred ropes twenty feet long. The air of a well will keep butter sweet for several weeks in the hottest weather. It is best to have one kettle or basket to put the butter in that is used at the table; it should be deep enough to hold five or six plates, each covered with a saucer. It can be kept in this way as firm and sweet as in an ice-house. You can have a separate kettle to put a large lump of butter in for seasoning vegetables. If you print butter for home use, it is not necessary to weigh it; make it out in little lumps that will weigh about half a pound; scald
<pb n="178" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=182"/>
the print and ladle, and put them in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> as you print each lump, lay it on a dish.</p>
<p>In winter it is more difficult to have good butter, as much depends on the food of the cows; the milk should be kept in a cellar, where it will not freeze; if you have a safe to keep it in, it need not be covered. Cream takes much longer to rise in winter; after it has stood two days, to put it on the top of a moderately heated stove will assist it; when it is hot, set it away to skim the next day, when the cream will be thick and rich, and churns easier.</p>
<p>If the weather is very cold, and the cream has been chilled, have a large pot of water over the fire, set in the bucket when it is near boiling heat, and keep stirring till it is milk-warm; have the churn scalded and put it in; by churning steadily, it will come as quick as in summer; one good working answers very well for butter in winter; always scald the churn before you put in the cream in cold weather.</p>

<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To put up Butter for Winter.</purpose>

Work it well, and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it rather more than for table use, and pack it in stone pans or jars, with a thin cloth on the top, and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on it an inch thick; keep it in a cool place, and if it is sweet when made, it will keep good till spring. It should be tied up with paper to exclude the air.</p>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">To Cure Butter that will keep for a Length of Time.</purpose>

Reduce separately to a fine powder two pounds of the best <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> one pound of <ingredient>loaf-sugar</ingredient> and half a pound of <ingredient>saltpetre.</ingredient> Sift these ingredients one above another, on a large sized sheet of paper, then mix them
<pb n="179" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=183"/>
well together; keep this mixture covered up close in a nice jar, and placed in a dry closet.</p>
<p>When your <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is worked and salted in the usual way, and ready to put in the jars, use one ounce of this composition to every pound of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> work it well into the mass.</p>
<p><ingredient>Butter</ingredient> cured in this way, (it is said) will keep good for several years. I have never kept it longer than from the fall until late in the spring, it was then very sweet and good.</p>
<p>It will not do to use for a month, because earlier, the salts will not be sufficiently blended with it. It should be kept in wooden vessels, or nice stone jars. Earthenware jars are not suitable for butter, as during the decomposition of the salts, they corrode the glazing; and the butter becomes rancid and unhealthy.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, and a lady of much experience, remarked on reading the above--"This is an admirable receipt, and by attention to its directions, butter may be packed away with success even in the summer months. Thus in cities during warm weather butter is often cheap, a house-keeper may then purchase her winter supply.</p>
<p>"Select that which is sweetest and most firm; begin by putting a layer of the prints in the bottom of a stone pot; press the butter down close, so that no cavities for the admission of air may remain, then strew more of the mixture over it; proceed in this manner until the vessel is filled, when put on the top a small muslin bag filled with salt, and tie the jar up close. It is very important to keep the butter in a cool place."</p>
<p>A great deal depends on the butter being well worked. Persons that have large dairies should always have a machine to work it. A large churning
<pb n="180" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=184"/>
may be more effectually cleared of the butter-milk in a few minutes, than in the old way in an hour. By doing it quickly, it does not get soft and oily in hot weather.</p>

Persons living in the country sometimes have more <ingredient>milk</ingredient> than they can use, of which cheese may be made.

three inches square in a tea-cup of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and stir it in the <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> cover the tub and let it stand in a warm place; when the curd begins to form, cut it in squares with a long wooden knife, and spread a thin towel over it. When the whey comes through the cloth, you can dip it off with a saucer, then put a thin towel in the <implement>cheese vat,</implement> put in the curd, spread the cloth over the top, put on the lid, and press it moderately about half an hour; then put it back in the tub and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it to your taste; mix it well, and if you want it very rich put in a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> it is always better to skim the night's <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and put in <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> as the cream is apt to press out.</p>
<p>Have a clean cloth in the vat, put in the curd, close it over and put on the cover; if you have no <implement>cheese press,</implement> a heavy stone will answer the purpose; press it very gently at first, to keep the richness from running out. The next morning draw it out by the cloth, wash and wipe the vat, put in a clean cloth, and turn in the cheese upside down; do this morning and evening for two days; when take out the cheese, and put it on a clean board; set it where the mice and flies will not get at it; rub it every morning with a little <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and turn it three times a day; dust it over with <ingredient>cayenne pepper</ingredient> if you cannot keep it from the flies, and if it should crack, plaster on a piece of white paper with butter; it is fit for use in two weeks.</p>
<p>Cheese made in this way has a rich, mild taste, and most persons are fond of it. If you get eight gallons of milk a day, you may make cheese twice a week, and still have butter for the family. You should keep four thin cloths on purpose for cheese.</p>

It requires some care and experience to have good soap; but when you once get beforehand, it is easy to keep up the supply if the ashes are good.

When you are ready to make soap, have a large pot of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which must be kept boiling, and put it on as fast as it will bear; save the strongest <ingredient>ley</ingredient> by itself; (if the <ingredient>ley</ingredient> will float an egg, it will answer;) have your <ingredient>soap-fat</ingredient> laying in strong <ingredient>ley</ingredient> through the winter; put a gallon of this in a large pot, and put to it a gallon of the strongest <ingredient>ley;</ingredient> let it boil an hour, stirring it often, then put in two gallons more of strong <ingredient>ley;</ingredient> when this has boiled, put in <ingredient>weak ley</ingredient> till the pot is full; let it boil an hour or two slowly, and be careful that it does not go over; cool some on a plate, and if thick, it is done, but if not, boil it longer. Put it away in a tight barrel, and prepare to make more soap; if you have two large pots both of them can be kept going at the same time. Several barrels of soap can be made from one <implement>ley stand.</implement> A large <implement>oil cask</implement> is good to keep soap in.

Do not trust to servants, examine and see that it is done thoroughly.</p>
<p>The apartments where cold meat and milk are kept should be cobwebbed and swept once a week, and the safe washed out at least that often. If the cellar is paved with brick, keep a part of it washed clean, to set cold meat and milk on; cover them with tin pans and put a weight on the top if rats are troublesome. If there are rat holes have them stopped with pieces of brick, and broken glass bottles; never use ratsbane without the greatest caution, as it is a dangerous remedy. No food or milk should be in the cellar at the time, and keep it locked up all the while it is there. I have heard of lives being lost by it.

In making new feather beds, put half a pound of <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> and half a pound of <ingredient>black pepper</ingredient> in each bed; this will prevent the moths from getting into new feathers that have not been well cured. It is best to air your beds frequently, and shake them up, even if they are not slept in.

<p>If you have a garden, be careful to raise herbs, both for cooking and to use in sickness. Parsley, thyme, sage and sweet marjoram occupy very little room in a garden, and cannot very well be dispensed with for kitchen use; and every family should have a bunch of wormwood; it is a fine tonic, either made while fresh, cut fine, with cold water, or after it has been dried, made with boiling water. Tansey is also a useful herb. Hoarhound is excellent for coughs, and is particularly useful in consumptive complaints, either as a syrup or made into candy. Balm is a cooling drink in a fever. Catnip tea is useful when you have a cold, and wish to produce a perspiration, and is good for infants that have the colic. Garlic is good for colds, and for children that have the croup; you should have some taken up in the fall to use through the winter. The root of elecampane gathered in the fall, scraped, sliced, and strung with a needle and thread to dry, will keep its strength for several years, and is useful for a cough with hoarhound. Rue is a valuable herb; a tea made of it and sweetened is good for worms.</p>

<p>Such herbs as sage, thyme and sweet marjoram, when thoroughly dry, should be pounded, sifted, and corked in bottles. Parsley should be cut fine with a pair of scissors, dried, and put in bottles; it is nearly as good this way as when fresh; keep it in a dark closet.</p>

<hd align="center">SIMPLE REMEDIES.</hd>
<p>THE following remedies are for diseases which occur in almost every family, and have been proved to be useful in a number of instances. As most old housekeepers have their favorite recipes, it is for the young and inexperienced these are particularly intended, and may be used with safety, when a physician is not at hand.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center">Remarks upon a Deeply Seated Cough.</hd>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>It is very important to begin in time with a cold. <purpose>Consumption</purpose>

is sometimes prevented by very simple remedies. To put <ingredient>Burgundy pitch plasters</ingredient> on the breast and back of the neck, often has a good effect; they should be re-spread frequently, and when one part is irritated, change them to another place. Put one on your side if you have a pain there.</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p>Flannel should be put on next the skin by all means, which, with the above simple remedies, will <purpose>cure a cold,</purpose>

if begun with in time.</p>
</formula>
<p>I have frequently known new flannel put on those that usually wore it, greatly to benefit a delicate person. The increased irritation of the new flannel acts on the pores of the skin and promotes circulation. Hair soles worn in the shoe, or socks made of flannel, or soft buckskin worn under the stockings, are very good to keep the feet warm and dry. Persons predisposed to consumption should have nourishing food, and not eat too much at a time; they should avoid strong tea or coffee, and drink milk. Eggs, oysters, fresh fish and fowls, are very good for them. Fruit of all kinds is useful.</p>
<pb n="227" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=231"/>
<p>They should take exercise in the air, particularly riding on horse-back, or take a short walk, but not so as to be fatigued; to work moderately in a garden when the ground is not too damp, is good exercise for a delicate person; the smell of fresh earth, and of flowers, is beneficial to both body and mind. After taking exercise, a glass of lemonade is very refreshing, and promotes appetite.</p>
<p>If there should be perspiration at night, change the sheets and pillow-cases frequently, and the under garments; air the chamber and bed-clothes every day; if the weather is too damp to raise the windows, shake up the bed, and leave it unmade half of the day, and put it out in the sun occasionally.</p>
<p>By all means avoid strong medicine, or any thing that has a tendency to weaken the body.</p>
<p>Sometimes blisters are used with very good effect; also, rubbing the breast and back with camphor or spirits, or with a piece of dry flannel.</p>
<p>Taking anodyne drops, particularly laudanum, should be avoided, if possible; they may still the cough during the night, but it will come on with increased violence in the morning; they weaken the stomach, increase the fever, and sometimes cause delirium.</p>
<p>Every thing that tends to excite or irritate the mind, should be kept from them. It is very important to talk cheerfully to sick persons, particularly if confined to their chamber, which can be done without lightness or trifling.</p>
<p>If they see gloomy faces around them, it has a very disheartening effect; and, if the mind sinks, such is its intimate connection with the body, that it is hard to raise it.</p>
<p>I have known persons by judicious management to
<pb n="228" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=232"/>
live for many years, after it was thought they were in a deep decline, by avoiding weakening medicines, taking exercise on horse-back and on foot, and never indulging in a full meal.</p>
<p>Sometimes such persons have very good appetites, and it is a satisfaction to their friends to see them eat heartily; but they should eat something frequently, rather than over-load the stomach too much.</p>
<p>When they come in hungry from a ride, to beat up an egg with a tea-spoonful of wine, and a little sugar and nutmeg put in a <implement>tumbler</implement> with some milk, and taken with a cracker or biscuit, or a piece of thin toast broken up in it, has a very strengthening effect.</p>
<p>Persons are seldom benefitted by a strict diet, but it is sometimes enforced till they lose their appetite and cannot eat.</p>
<p>If the weather is so that exercise cannot be taken out of doors, some method should be devised for taking it in the house. Rubbing furniture and playing battle-door, are good exercise for a female, but should not be taken too much at a time.</p>
<p>Men that are confined to the house are sometimes very much at a loss what to do; if such would purchase a few tools, and appropriate a spare room as a work-shop, it would promote their health. I have known men that were but little acquainted with the use of tools, do many useful and ornamental pieces of work, that were greatly valued by their friends; and the exertion kept their spirits from sinking, when the weather was too inclement to take exercise in the open air.</p>

<p>Put two pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> in a pint of <ingredient>hoarhound tea,</ingredient> as strong as can be made, which may be done by drawing two sets of hoarhound in the same water, till the strength is out of each; when it is cold, mix in the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and the <ingredient>white of an egg;</ingredient> when it begins to boil, take off the scum as it rises, boil it slowly till it becomes thick, so that when you drop it on a plate, it will be hard and crisp, and pour it out in plates that have been greased with a little <ingredient>sweet butter;</ingredient> when cold, you can break it up for use, and tie it up in a jar. This is quite as useful as the candy you buy, and is much cheaper; it is very convenient for persons that

<p><variation>Sore throats have been cured when quinsy was apprehended, by using <ingredient>powdered camphor</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> on flannel. It is a good way, when persons are subject to it, to keep an ounce of <ingredient>camphor</ingredient> mixed with <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> in a wide-mouthed bottle, or jar, and corked tight. The <ingredient>cayenne pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>honey</ingredient> gargle should also be kept ready mixed, and used when the first symptoms appear; or in a violent attack, a plaster of <ingredient>snuff</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> may be applied with benefit, keeping it on only a few minutes at a time. Sometimes a bag of <ingredient>hot ashes</ingredient> sprinkled with <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and applied hot as can be borne, has cured a sore throat in one night. Persons that have been afflicted for years with repeated attacks of <purpose>sore throat and quinsy,</purpose>

have been cured by bathing the throat, neck and ears with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> every morning. The constant use of the shower bath is very important. Keep the feet warm.</variation></p>

For an infant of six months, a small tea-spoonful is a dose, and for a child of four years, two tea-spoonsful. Where there is not much fever, a little <ingredient>port or claret wine,</ingredient> mixed with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and taken with <ingredient>toast</ingredient> broken in it, is beneficial. Children should be taken out riding if possible, and should be well wrapped up.</variation></p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">For the Croup.</purpose>

Put the child in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and keep up the temperature by putting in more <ingredient>hot water;</ingredient> keep it in fifteen or twenty minutes, then wipe it dry and put it in a warm bed, or wrap a blanket round it and hold it on the lap; give it an emetic, and put <ingredient>powdered garlic</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to the throat and soles of the feet; keep up the perspiration, by giving a few drops of <ingredient>antimonial wine</ingredient> every half hour. The next morning give it a dose of <ingredient>rhubarb tea</ingredient> or <ingredient>castor oil,</ingredient> and keep it from the air for several days. This treatment has been very beneficial when a physician was not at hand; and if
<pb n="234" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=238"/>
nothing had been done till his arrival, perhaps the child would have been too far gone to recover.</p>
<p><variation>In cases of croup, to wet a piece of flannel with <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> and apply it to the throat as hot as it can be borne, has often a salutary effect, applied frequently. It is also good to use for a <purpose>bad cold,</purpose>

&amp;c.</variation></p>
<p><variation><ingredient>Molasses</ingredient> stewed with a lump of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and a table-spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> taken just before you go to bed, and to grease the nose, forehead and breast with <ingredient>mutton tallow,</ingredient> will sometimes cure a child without any thing else.</variation> <variation>To pound <ingredient>garlic</ingredient> in a rag and squeeze out the juice, mix it with <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> and give a tea-spoonful at a time, has given relief when a child was very ill.</variation> <variation>Sliced <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> or <ingredient>garlic</ingredient> stewed with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> or <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> is very good to take <purpose>for a cold.</purpose>

</variation> Where children are subject to the croup, you should always have a pot of water over the fire, and lightwood near, to heat it as quick as possible. Children that are subject to these attacks should have their feet kept warm and dry, and always wear flannel next to the skin.</p>
<p>It is the duty of parents to make use of the most simple remedies, which may always be in readiness, and, if applied in time, may prevent the necessity of giving strong medicines, which injure the constitutions of young children. The least symptom of the disease should be attended to. <variation><ingredient>Lobelia</ingredient> is a certain remedy for croup. If the case is light, a few drops of the <ingredient>tincture,</ingredient> increasing the dose according to the age of the child, given at short intervals, will cause it to vomit and prevent danger; but if the attack is a severe one, you should give the "third preparation of lobelia;" for a child of ten years, ten drops, and so on in proportion; mix it with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Every mother should
<pb n="235" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=239"/>
keep <ingredient>lobelia</ingredient> at hand, as it has been known to give certain relief in many cases.</variation></p>
<p>A child of twelve months, may take of the <ingredient>tincture</ingredient> ten drops every fifteen or twenty minutes, till it acts as an emetic, or relieves by perspiration; one of two or three years may take twenty or thirty drops. The third preparation is of much greater strength than the <ingredient>tincture.</ingredient></p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Infants' Colic, &amp;c.</purpose>

<ingredient>Tea made of catnip,</ingredient> and sweetened, given to an infant when it appears to be in pain, is often useful. <variation><ingredient>Sweet marjoram tea</ingredient> also relieves pain, and has a soothing effect on the nerves.</variation></p>
<p>To put the feet in warm water, and put a warm piece of flannel to the stomach, is important; but if neither of these relieve the child, put it in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> for about ten minutes, and cover it from the air carefully; wipe it dry, and keep it warm afterwards.</p>
<p><variation>A little <ingredient>weak ginger tea</ingredient> is good for the colic;</variation> <variation>as also <ingredient>tea made of dried damask rose leaves;</ingredient> a tea-spoonful of leaves will make a tea-cupful of tea.</variation></p>
<p>Uneasiness is frequently caused by their stomachs being overloaded with food, and care should be taken in this respect.</p>
<p>Having lately met with some remarks in the "Baltimore American," with which I am much pleased, I take the liberty of inserting them. "Narcotics and anodynes cannot be given with too much caution; the sensitive and nervous system of an infant should never be acted upon by these powerful drugs unless in extreme cases, and of these, few mothers should presume to judge. Two drops of laudanum, says the London Medical Gazette, have been known to kill an
<pb n="236" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=240"/>
infant; and a single drop, it is said, stole the life of a new born babe.</p>
<p>"The most experienced medical men never administer medicines of this class to the very young, without exercising the utmost caution, and making the most accurate calculations.</p>
<p>"In the present day, the more general diffusion of correct facts in physiology and pathology has caused a large class of young mothers to reject the old system of giving narcotic drugs to infants. In carrying out this salutary reformation like all other reformers, they have a strong opposition to contend with; old fashioned nurses do much harm in opposing all nursery reformations, consequently young mothers will have a hard task to execute.</p>
<p>"Too many have not the steady courage to hold on to the end in mild, but firm opposition to all erroneous, but well meant interference. But there are others whose pure and unswerving love for their tender offspring keeps them firm to their duty; to those the next generation will owe much. They are the little band of true-hearted reformers, whose good example will be like leaven, spreading until its influence is felt throughout the wide circle of maternal responsibility."</p>
</formula>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Summer Diseases.</purpose>

The food of children in summer, should be light and nourishing; if of milk, be careful that it is sweet. If you cannot get it fresh as often as you want it, boiling will keep it sweet. Sour milk and improper food sometimes bring on the summer disease, which is easier prevented than cured.</p>
<p>A little <ingredient>rhubarb tea or tincture,</ingredient> with a small quantity of <ingredient>prepared chalk,</ingredient> will sometimes check it in its
<pb n="237" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=241"/>
early stages, but the most effectual medicine that I have tried is called by some apothecaries, "red mixture," of which I will give a recipe.</p>
<p><variation><ingredient>Chicken water,</ingredient> slightly salted, is very good; make but a little at a time, and have it fresh.</variation></p>
<p><variation><ingredient>Rice gruel,</ingredient> sweetened with <ingredient>loaf-sugar,</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> is nourishing.</variation> <variation>To make a drink of <ingredient>slippery-elm,</ingredient> shave the <ingredient>bark</ingredient> fine and put it in <ingredient>water;</ingredient> strain it, mix it with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and sweeten it.</variation> <variation><ingredient>Elderberry and blackberry cordials</ingredient> are also good in cases where there is no fever.</variation></p>
<p><variation>The stomach and back should be bathed with <ingredient>spirits;</ingredient> and a little bag of <ingredient>pounded spices,</ingredient> wet with <ingredient>spirits,</ingredient> applied to the stomach, may be used with safety, when not within reach of a physician.</variation></p>
<p><variation>A bark jacket has been used with success in many instances; cut it out of fine muslin, to be double, spread it open, and cover one side with about two ounces of the best <ingredient>Lima bark,</ingredient> and twelve pounded <ingredient>cloves;</ingredient> put on the other side, sew it up, and quilt it across; put on shoulder straps and strings of soft ribbon; sprinkle it with <ingredient>spirits</ingredient> twice a day.</variation></p>
<p>The child should have the benefit of the morning and evening air. If it is not convenient to ride it out, walking will answer, in the arms of a careful nurse, carried on a pillow, with an umbrella to protect its eyes from the light.</p>
<p>When a child is taken sick in a city, removing it to the country often has a beneficial effect. <variation><ingredient>Milk</ingredient> thickened with <ingredient>arrow root</ingredient> is good diet for children.</variation> <variation><ingredient>Flour</ingredient> dried in an oven for several hours, and used to thicken <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water,</ingredient> is also good, sweetened with <ingredient>loaf-sugar,</ingredient> and is nutritious.</variation> They should eat but a small portion of any thing at a time.</p>
<pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=242"/>
<p><variation>To cut slices of lean fresh <ingredient>beef</ingredient> or <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> put it in a bowl, and pour a pint of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> on it, and let it set close to the fire for an hour, is very good to give children occasionally, with but little <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> the stomach will sometimes retain this when other things are rejected. As thirst is an attendant on this disease, much <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should be avoided in all their food.</variation> Every thing about a sick child should be kept clean, and its clothes well aired before changing them. If it is too ill to carry out of doors, have it changed from one room to another, and the apartment it left well aired.</p>
<p>Children who are afflicted with this disease, sometimes crave fruit. Ripe <ingredient>peaches,</ingredient> fresh from the tree, or ripe <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> baked or roasted before the fire, may be occasionally administered in small quantities with perfect safety.</p>
<p>To make toast-water, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be toasted on both sides very dry, and <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> poured on it.</p>
<p>I hope these hints will be useful to persons that cannot procure a physician, which is often the case in the country.</p>

To produce warmth, rub the person with a crash towel, or horse hair glove. You should be careful to take some exercise after the bath, or you will be more liable to take cold. Never take a bath soon after a meal, as that is injurious. Persons subject to colds, sore throat, rheumatism, sick head-ache, nervous disease, or general debility, have been greatly benefitted by the daily use of the shower bath. Children that are oppressed with heat are much refreshed, and will rest well after a bath; the water should be moderated for them. Infants should be bathed every morning in a tub of water about milk warm, and may be very early accustomed to its use; they will become fond of it, and are less liable to take cold from exposure to the air.

<hd rend="bold" align="center">Remarks on Preparing Food for the Sick.</hd>
<p>FEW young persons understand cooking for the sick. It is very important to know how to prepare their food in an inviting manner; every thing should be perfectly clean and nice. Avoid giving an invalid any thing out of a cup that has been used before; even if it is medicine, it will not be so hard to take out of a clean cup. It is well to have a stand or small table by the bedside, that you can set any thing on. A small silver strainer that will just fit over a <implement>tumbler</implement> or <implement>tea-cup,</implement> is very useful to strain lemonade, panada or herb tea.</p>
<p>If you want any thing to use through the night, you should prepare it, if possible, beforehand; as a person that is sick, can sometimes fall asleep without knowing it, if the room is <emph rend="italic">kept perfectly still.</emph></p>

<hd align="center">DOMESTICS.</hd>
<section class1="servants">
<hd rend="bold" align="center">Hints on the Management of Domestics, &amp;c.</hd>
<p>SOME families are always changing their domestics, and weary their friends with complaints of those they have, and inquiries for others.</p>
<p>Deliberate before you make a change; if servants are honest, speak the truth, and have an obliging disposition, it is better to bear with a few defects, than to discharge them; these are qualifications for the foundation of a good servant; and some of the most valuable I have had, were such as could hardly be put up with at first. By being patient, and speaking to them in a kind manner, they become attached and fearful of doing any thing to offend.</p>
<p>When they break any thing, or an accident occurs, accustom them to inform you of it immediately. Few mistresses, of well regulated minds, will be offended when openly told of accidents; but if they are left to be found out, you always feel more disposed to blame and reprove them. By speaking to them in a mild and forgiving manner, careless servants will become more careful.</p>
<p>A considerate mistress may, without loss of dignity, make them feel that she regards it as her duty to be their friend, and that she feels herself under an obligation to advise them in difficulties and promote their comfort.</p>
<p>We should reflect that theirs is a life of servitude, and if they over-exert themselves, or are too much exposed in early life, it will bring on disease that will shorten their days, or render old age a burden.</p>
<pb n="275" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=279"/>
<p>Some young persons are too indolent to wait on themselves, and ring for the servants on the most trifling occasions; when if they were accustomed to perform these little offices, their health would be much better, and we should not hear of so many complaints, the result of want of exercise. All female servants should have time to attend to their clothing; many have to work so hard through the day that their only leisure is at night, and then they hurry over their things in a careless manner.</p>
<p>Where your circumstances permit, a good man-servant is a valuable acquisition; and they are sometimes more easily governed than females.</p>
<p>If mistresses were better informed, they would not complain so much of the ignorance and awkwardness of their domestics. Always give them their orders in time. If a new dish is to be cooked, superintend its preparation yourself.</p>
<p>If you are capable of directing, a cook will soon learn to do without your constant attention.</p>
<p>If they are slow in their movements, insist on their beginning early to prepare a meal, so that there will be time sufficient for every thing to be done properly.</p>
<p>If you expect company, have every thing prepared, that can be done with safety, the day previous. In summer there are but few things that can be done without risk of spoiling: a ham or tongue may be washed ready to boil; castors and salt-stands put in order, and pastry or dessert prepared, that will not spoil by being kept a day.</p>
<p>In winter, many things can be kept for days in a state of preparation for cooking; and it greatly assists the work of the family, to have every thing done beforehand.</p>
<pb n="276" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=280"/>
<p>Do with as few domestics as possible; assist with the work yourself, rather than keep one too many. Those that take orphan children to bring up, are often rewarded for their trouble; as sometimes a girl of fifteen will be more useful than one much older: and where a family is small it does very well; but in large families, a little girl is so often called from her work, that it has a tendency to unsettle and make her careless.</p>
<p>Never allow your children to call on or interrupt servants when at their work or meals, to do any thing which a child could do for itself; children that treat domestics with respect, will generally find them willing to render any assistance in their power. I have known a few house-keepers, who have kept the same servants for years; who have assisted in rearing the children, until they almost viewed them as their own; and these were not faultless. If they had been discharged for trifles, they might have wandered, from one family to another, without being attached to any, until they became so indifferent, as not to be worthy of employ; but by the kindness and patience of their employer, they became so grateful and attached, as to be a treasure to her family. When they become weary of such constant servitude, would it not be better, instead of discharging, to give them time for rest and recreation in visiting their friends? I have known them to return, renewed in health and spirits.</p>
<p>Encourage them to lay by as much of their wages as they can possibly spare, in such institutions as are thought the most safe, that they may have something to look to in case of sickness, or any event which would require its use.</p>
<p>Promote their reading in such books as are suited to their capacities; they sometimes have a little leisure,
<pb n="277" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=281"/>
that could be well filled up in this way. I have found it to increase the happiness of those under my care, to encourage a fondness for reading, and improving their minds; it tends to keep them from unprofitable company, and too much visiting, to which so many are addicted.</p>
<p>Young girls should make and mend their own clothes, and keep them in good order, and they should be taught to knit. The material of which stockings are composed costs but little, and they wear much better than those that are bought. Knitting fills up leisure moments, and promotes industrious habits; and when age comes on, they will have a resource, although it appears so simple, yet if it is not learned while young it is hard to acquire when old.</p>
<p>When servants are guilty of faults that cannot be looked over, instead of publicly reproving them, take an opportunity when alone, and talk coolly; tell them of your sorrow at being obliged to notice their conduct, encourage them to pursue a different course, and that you will forgive them if they will strive to do better. I have known them much improved by this mode of treatment.</p>
<p>By inspecting every department, not only will waste be prevented, but dishonesty. In cities many persons find it necessary to lock up nearly every thing; and it is a lamentable state of things that so few are to be trusted.</p>
<p>Sometimes treating servants with confidence will have a good effect; but let them be aware that you have a knowledge of every thing that is going on.</p>
<p>Some young persons are completely at the mercy of their domestics. I have known great uneasiness to be experienced, and much loss; but by showing a little
<pb n="278" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=282"/>
moral courage, and discharging those that are irreclaimable, an ascendancy was gained. Never suffer them to treat you with disrespect or impertinence. If it is known that they will be discharged for these faults, they will be on their guard.</p>
<p>If you have taken a boy or girl, to bring up as a domestic, endeavour to teach them, at least to spell and read; they are sometimes very fond of their books, and if you once get them to reading, it will become to them a favorite evening amusement; I have known them take up their books on every occasion of leisure. I have seen boys that worked hard through the day, spend all the evening with their books, slate, and occasionally a little writing. Sometimes, I have in the evening felt fatigued and listless, and would much rather read, and amuse myself, than go out to teach two or three in the kitchen; but in attending to this, (which I consider a duty,) have felt a sweet reward--indeed, their grateful thanks expressed by words, have encouraged me to keep on. I have thought a little instruction in this way, arouses their faculties, and tends to make them more industrious. When I have been prevented from teaching them for some time, by indisposition, or other causes, I have observed they were not so cheerful in the performance of their work. If they are reading any thing they do not fully understand, take a little time to explain it to them. It will be, my young friends, like sowing the good seed, and you, as well as they, will receive the reward.</p>
<p>I wish to encourage you in the most affectionate manner to attend to <emph rend="italic">this</emph> duty; you will find it will strengthen you in the performance of others. "The more we exert our faculties, the more we can accomplish.

As when parents are engaged with their friends or guests, they have no time to devote to the manners of their children, and to reprove them at table is very unpleasant, as well as mortifying.</p>
<p>Young children will soon acquire the manner of sitting quietly till they are helped, if they are made to understand that they will not be permitted to eat with their parents and friends, unless they behave with propriety.</p>
<p>I have thought it a great assistance to the good order of a large family, for every member to be punctual in their attendance at meals, and all to sit down together, with a short pause before the carving and
<pb n="280" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=284"/>
helping commences. In those moments of quiet, the heart is sometimes awakened to a feeling of gratitude to the Almighty dispenser of our blessings.</p>
<p>At the table, different members of the family meet; and where affection and kindness, those aids to true politeness, preside, it is truly a delightful treat to be the guest of such a family.</p>
<p>Every symptom of selfishness should be discouraged, for if suffered to take root in a child, it lays the foundation of much that is disagreeable to themselves and others.</p>
<p>Inculcate this excellent rule, "of doing unto others, what you wish others to do unto you," and always preferring others to yourself.</p>
<p>It is the custom in some well regulated families, to permit the younger members, (as they arrive at a suitable age,) to take turns in presiding, not only at breakfast and tea, but at the dinner table. I have known quite young girls that had been taught in this way, carve a fowl or joint of meat with ease and grace. In helping, they should be taught not to overload the plate, as it takes away the appetite of some persons to be helped too largely.</p>
<p>The gravy should be stirred so that all may be helped alike, and a small quantity put on the meat or fowl, to which it belongs, and not on vegetables unless it is particularly desired.</p>
<p>If there should be a rare dish on the table, it is best to hand it round and let every one help himself, after it has been nicely cut up. Ham is much nicer to be cut in very thin slices. So is salt beef and tongue.</p>
<p>Young housekeepers in selecting their dishes for dinner, (if they have not an experienced cook,) should
<pb n="281" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=285"/>
avoid those that are difficult to prepare. Never try a new dish when you expect company. Your guests will be more gratified with a neat and moderate table, with a few plain and well cooked dishes, accompanied with the smiling countenance of the hostess, than with a great variety of ill cooked and badly arranged viands.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center">Economy the Source of Charity.</hd>
<p>If your circumstances will not admit of giving away much, you can, by economy, give a little, and a blessing will attend it. There are few of the very poor, that know how to repair old clothing to advantage; a garment will be of much more service, that is well mended before it is given to them.</p>
<p>It has been remarked, that the poor are ungrateful, and forget the favors conferred upon them.</p>
<p>I have seldom found them deficient in this respect; and when they are, if we would reflect, that if some of us received no more than we deserve, we should be but poorly off.</p>
<p>We know in our own families, how acceptable is a nice present of something that a sick member can eat; and it is sometimes the means of restoring the appetite, when any thing cooked in the house is rejected. The feeling of love with which it is presented, is as a cordial to a sick person.</p>
<p>How much more acceptable will something nourishing be to one oppressed with poverty, as well as sickness.</p>
<p>When the rich are diseased, the physician often finds it necessary to enjoin strict abstinence; but very different is it with the poor, who frequently suffer for want of nourishment.</p>
<p>When the mother of a poor family is ill, how greatly are her sufferings augmented by the knowledge that
<pb n="282" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=286"/>
her children are deprived of her services; and how acceptable to such a family would be a loaf of bread, or a large bowl of soup, which could be made of materials that would hardly be missed.</p>
<p>Dried beans or peas, and onions, are a cheap and valuable addition to soup; also cold vegetables. The liquor that fresh meat is boiled in, should be carefully saved for that purpose, if there are those near you that need it.</p>
<p>It may seem at first troublesome to a young housekeeper, to take the necessary care to save for the poor. It is certainly much easier to let the cook have her own way, and waste or not, as she pleases; but for your encouragement my young friends, permit me to say, you will be sweetly rewarded for your attention to them.</p>
<p>One eminent for his charities, near the close of life, made this remark: "What I spent I lost, but what I gave away remains with me."</p>

<section class1="childrear">
<hd rend="bold" align="center">To Encourage Children in Acts of Kindness to the Aged and Afflicted.</hd>
<p>Young children may early be taught to administer to the wants of the aged and infirm.</p>
<p>Some mothers are in the practice of giving a small sum of money to their children, as a reward for some little service or piece of work that they have done. The money thus obtained, to be laid out for a sick or old poor person. This method has an excellent effect on the minds of children; it incites them to industry, teaches self-denial, and the feelings of love and charity which are thus early instilled into their tender minds, make a lasting impression.</p>
<pb n="283" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=287"/>
<p>If they spent their little fund in trifles for their own use, they would acquire a habit of selfishness; which, when once formed, it is most difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p>I have remarked the pleasure with which children will relate the incidents of a visit, which they have been permitted to make to a poor family; and it is a refreshment to persons advanced in life, to see a young family thus trained.</p>
<p>As soon as little girls can sew, they should be encouraged to make garments for the poor, or repair their own old ones as a present to a child of their own size, or make patchwork out of old dresses for a bed covering for poor people. Their being permitted to do these things, should be as a reward for good behavior in attention to their lessons or other duties.</p>
<p>When they are old enough to make a loaf of bread, a pie, or a little plain cake, allow them to do it, and take as a present to, or make broth or panada for a sick person. This teaches them to prepare these things while young, and may be useful to them in after life.</p>
<p>How cheering it must be to the aged or afflicted, to see smiling young faces enter their dwellings, bearing their little offerings of food or clothing, the work of their own hands.</p>
<p>Be encouraged my dear young mothers; if you thus train your children to works of charity, you will be doubly blessed.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center">Early Rising Promotes Punctuality.</hd>
<p>It is an old and true saying, "that if you waste an hour in the morning, it is seldom recovered all that day." This dispirits you, and the next day there is still something left undone.</p>
<pb n="284" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=288"/>
<p>A late riser is rarely punctual in her engagements, and more of the happiness of married life depends on forming a habit of strict punctuality, than young persons are generally aware of.</p>
<p>If you are distressed at having acquired habits of late rising, and want of punctuality, remember by perseverance, they can be overcome. Fix an hour for rising, and let nothing but illness prevent your being up at that time. While forming this useful habit, you should retire to rest early.</p>
<p>Many things can be better attended to at an early, than a late hour in the morning.</p>
<p>Where families rise before the sun, the day seems much longer; all the active employments of the early riser are accomplished before her later neighbors have finished their breakfast.</p>
<p>The duties of the bath and toilet being performed, her chamber well aired and arranged--and her parlor in order, she is ready for the more quiet employments of reading and sewing.</p>
<p>In a well regulated household, servants perform their duties with life and energy. Determine on an hour for your meals, and if all the members of the family adhere to it, scrupulous exactness will soon be established.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd rend="bold" align="center">Hints to Young Wives.</hd>
<p>The authoress is well aware of the difficulties which surround a young wife on her first setting out, particularly if situated at a distance from the kind mother who has hitherto directed her, with servants who watch every movement, and who will soon discover whether the new mistress is qualified for the task she has undertaken.</p>
<pb n="285" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=289"/>
<p>Accustom yourself to rise early; fix a certain hour, and let nothing but indisposition prevent your being up at the appointed time. By this means your affairs will all be arranged in good season, and you will have time for recreation, in walking, riding, or in reading such authors as will tend to strengthen and improve your mind.</p>
<p>Young persons removed from large families often suffer greatly from loneliness, whereas, if they were occupied with household affairs, they would not feel so severely the absence of their husbands while attending to business.</p>
<p>Be punctual to the hour that has been fixed on for your meals, and let good order prevail in every department of which you have the command. A mistress of a family is much happier, who knows how every thing is going on from the garret to the cellar. By inspecting every thing you soon become interested, and we all know when that is the case, the most difficult pursuits become easy and pleasant.</p>
<p>And with what pleasure will a young wife welcome her husband to his meals, when her conscience assures her that she has done her best, and that nothing is neglected; and how will it lighten his labors to reflect, when absent, that the partner he has chosen, is performing her duty at home.</p>
<p>I am fully persuaded that the formation of domestic happiness, is generally laid the first year of marriage: therefore, my young friends, act well your part; if you desire to be treated with confidence you must merit it. If you keep an exact account of all your expenses, there will be less danger of living beyond your income, of which there have been so many lamentable instances.</p>
<pb n="286" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=290"/>
<p>Never buy any thing because it is recommended as being cheap; many cheap things amount in time to a large sum. In selecting furniture, let utility, not fashion, govern your choice; some young persons furnish their parlors so extravagantly, that necessary and useful articles are neglected, for want of means to purchase them. Be persuaded that happiness does not consist so much in having splendid furniture, as in attending to the every day comforts of those around you. If you marry without the useful knowledge necessary for governing your family, lose no time in acquiring it.</p>
<p>There is a time when most young girls show a fondness for domestic affairs before they are old enough to go into company, when it would be an agreeable change to be absent from school and assisting their mothers; the knowledge thus acquired would never be lost.</p>
<p>Many a young man who commenced with fair prospects, has been ruined through his wife's ignorance of domestic duties, and she has suffered from the consequent diminution of his esteem and love.</p>
<p>I once knew a lovely and accomplished young lady, accustomed to every indulgence, who, on her marriage, removed several hundred miles from her parents, to reside in the country, where servants were difficult to procure. This delicate and sensitive young creature was much distressed by her ignorance of almost every thing connected with housekeeping; and after suffering repeated mortifications, concluded to learn to do the work herself; and when this dearly bought knowledge was acquired, she was able to teach her ignorant servants; and resolved, if ever she had daughters, to use every means in her power to teach them.</p>
<p>When a prudent wife is made acquainted with the
<pb n="287" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=291"/>
circumstances of her husband, she will endeavor strictly to keep within their bounds; always remembering that losses and events, over which he has no control, may occur and greatly reduce his income. And how will it assist her to bear a reverse of fortune, if she has acted with discretion; it will strengthen the wife to encourage and cheer her partner, and enable him to struggle through difficulties which were thought insurmountable. Happiness will not forsake such a family; though they lose almost every thing, the peace which is the result of a good conscience will remain; this will strengthen them to begin anew, and the Divine blessing will attend such efforts.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center">A few Remarks to Encourage Young Housekeepers in their First Attempts.</hd>
<p>As bread is the most important article of food, one of your first attempts should be to make a few loaves of good bread and rolls, of the most simple kind. Bread rolls are very easily made. If you succeed tolerably, it will encourage you to try again. When you make cakes, begin with the simple kinds; plain jumbles or cakes that you can roll out, or crisp gingerbread. Sponge cake is easier than those that have butter in them; I have known young persons succeed very well with it. Bread rusk is also easily made, or a few plain pies. Do not trust the baking to an ignorant person, but superintend it yourself. Sometimes baking in a stove, is protracted by the dampness of the wood. Before you bake, have dry wood prepared. Watch the time; it is a good plan to have a clock near the kitchen. Do not have too many things on hand at once; but perfect yourself in the knowledge
<pb n="288" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=292"/>
of a few important dishes. If you make good yeast, you will be more certain of good bread, light cakes and rolls. To cook a steak nicely, is also important; and with a dish of potatoes well cooked, a dish of cold slaw and an apple pie, or a little stewed fruit, will make a good plain dinner.</p>
<p>When your family is small, you can have something nice every day, without cooking much. Veal cutlets, and mutton chops, are easy to cook, and may be prepared in a short time. If you have a fowl, and boil it, you can save the soup, and warm it over for the next day. A cold roast fowl may be hashed. On days that you have cold meat, a batter pudding, or plain rice pudding, is easily prepared.</p>
<p>If you wish to have an early breakfast, make every preparation that you can, over night; set the table, have the relish cut, ready to cook, or to warm over--and cold bread may be sliced, and wrapped in a cloth to keep it moist. Coffee should be ground, and dry fuel, and water at hand. With these preparations, breakfast may be ready in half an hour from the time the fire is made. If you have warm corn bread, or rolls, it will require more time; but if you have them made up over night, and put in a cool place, they will not sour, and can soon be baked. Maryland biscuit are very convenient, as they are always ready, and will keep good a week. I have found it a great advantage to set the table over night, particularly if you have a separate room to eat in; although it takes but a short time, every minute is important in the morning.</p>
<p>Where the mistress washes the breakfast things, and puts them in their proper places, and counts the spoons, and other articles, she can see when any thing is missing. A mop is useful for glass and china;
<pb n="289" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=293"/>
keep a pan, or a small tub, for the purpose of holding the water, which should not be too hot. If tea things are put in very hot water, it will be apt to crack them, or they will look smeared. Put a little soap in the water, wash the glass first, then the silver, then the cups and saucers, and lastly, the plates and knives and forks. If spoons have been used with eggs, put them to soak immediately, to prevent their turning dark. Have a common <implement>waiter</implement> for the pan to stand in and on it drain your tea things. Spoons when used with care, require polishing but seldom, as it wears the silver away. Dinner dishes should be washed first in moderately warm water and soap, rinsed in hot water, and drained before wiping. Put every thing in its proper place, and inspect your pantry and cellar frequently. Sometimes things are forgotten, for want of attention, until they are spoiled. Air the cellar frequently; do not let refuse vegetables accumulate, or any thing that would be likely to cause sickness.</p>
<p>You should provide coarse towels of different kinds, for china and glass, and for the dinner dishes; also knife cloths; have them marked and kept in their proper places. Some persons have their towels washed out every day; but it is better to save them for the weekly wash. If towels are thrown aside damp, they are liable to mildew. You should keep dusters of several kinds. Old silk handkerchiefs, are best for highly polished furniture, or an old barege veil answers a good purpose. For common purposes, a square of coarse muslin, or check is suitable. You should keep one floor cloth for chambers, and one for the kitchen. Keep brooms for different purposes; always use a soft one for carpets; as soon as they wear stiff, they will do for the kitchen, or pavements. Pouring a little hot
<pb n="290" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=294"/>
water on a broom, softens it for carpets. You may save tea leaves, to sprinkle over your carpet, when you give a thorough sweeping, this will brighten it; and occasionally to wipe it over, with a cloth, that has been wrung out of hot water cleanses it; of course, this is only required for carpets in constant use.</p>
<p>It is of great importance to health, that sleeping apartments should be well aired and swept. If you sleep in an apartment, where there has been fire during the day, it should be well aired before going to bed, or if the room is close, have a little air admitted, so as not to blow on persons that are asleep. A window that will lower from the top is an advantage. Beds should be well aired before they are made; take the clothes off, and leave them at least an hour. In pleasant weather, you may keep chamber windows hoisted, for several hours; and even in cold weather, the windows may be kept up a short time; and if on any occasion, you may be obliged to have the beds made without airing, turn the clothes half way down, and leave them for several hours. Some persons have cheap calico covers, to spread over beds, while the room is swept; this is a good plan, on account of the dust. Bolster and pillow ticks wear better, if you have a check case basted on, this should be changed, washed and starched occasionally. It is a good plan also to have check covers for matresses and feather beds; but the covers should not be kept on beds that are not in use, lest they should be liable to moth. In winter a blanket should be put next a bed that is not often slept in, or for a delicate person, and be particularly careful, that sheets are dry before they are put away.</p>
<p>In summer it is most healthy to have your chamber
<pb n="291" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=295"/>
floor bare, and have it washed occasionally. It is important to examine your clothes, after they come from the wash, and see that they are perfectly dry before they are put away.</p>

<hd align="center">CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.</hd>
<p>A FEW flowers and plants, when properly taken care of, are ornamental to the windows of a parlor, or sitting room; and will repay the care that is bestowed on them. Begin with a few that are easy to cultivate, and you will probably succeed. Persons that are fond of flowers, and have collected a number, are generally willing to give their young friends a few plants; and where we succeed in raising a fine plant from a slip, or cutting, we value it more than one that has been purchased at a green-house. Geraniums, cactus', wax plants, cape and catalonian jessamines, and some others, are easily cultivated in a parlor. Roses, camelias, and azaleas bloom best in a moderate temperature, as the heat of a parlor (unless very large) dries the buds, and prevents their coming to perfection. I have known these to bloom beautifully in a room that was very slightly heated--either over one in which there was fire, or in an apartment next a stove room. If the weather is very cold, they should be removed to a warmer room, until it moderates. The windows that are open to the south are best. When the blossoms have matured, you can bring them to the parlor; but if there is much heat, they will not remain perfect so long as in a moderate room.</p>
<pb n="292" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=296"/>
<p>Roses are sometimes troubled with insects, which should be brushed off with a feather, and the plants washed with a decoction of tobacco, (not too strong;) they will not bloom when thus infested. There is another insect that fastens itself to the bark of lemon trees, and other plants; frequent washing with soap-suds and brushing the stems, removes it; and sometimes wash the leaves with a sponge, when the weather is too cold to put them out of doors. Setting them out in a warm rain, or watering them well all over the foliage, is very reviving to plants. Be careful to have pieces of old broken earthen-ware at the bottom of each pot, to drain them, or the plants will not thrive. The earth should be sometimes removed, and an occasional re-potting, is an advantage; being careful not to disturb the roots. A mixture of charcoal and sand, and rich earth of more than one kind is thought best. Earth fresh from the woods is good for pot-plants, as well as borders, but should always be mixed with a stronger soil. Roses that are planted round a house, should have a deep and rich soil made for them, and they will then bloom beautifully all the season.</p>
<p>Pot-plants should in summer be placed in a situation where they will not be exposed to intense heat. Some persons place their pots in the earth on the north side of the house; others keep them in a porch where they can get some sun. They require much more water in summer. The wax plant blooms beautifully in summer, and should be kept in a sheltered situation, not exposed to the wind; it should have a strong frame of wood and wire to run on, well secured in a tub or box. Hyacinths and crocuses should be planted in pots, boxes, or small tubs, in rich earth, in October or November; a small painted tub is very suitable, and will
<pb n="293" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=dome&#38;PageNum=297"/>
hold a dozen hyacinths, and as many crocus roots. The most beautiful I ever saw in a window, were planted in this way, by keeping some in the sun, and others in the shade you can have a succession of blooms; they are also pretty in root-glasses, but this plan will exhaust the roots. After blooming in the house, they should be planted in the garden. The same roots will not answer the next year for parlor culture; they increase very fast in the garden by proper care.</p>
<p>There is something refining to the mind in the cultivation of flowers, either in a garden or in pots. Many hours that would be weary or lonely, are thus pleasantly occupied, and the mind refreshed.</p>
<p>I now take leave of the reader, with a sincere desire, that these remarks may be of use; and that the receipts which I have been at some pains in compiling and arranging, may be acceptable.</p>
