<p>STEAMED BROWN BREAD--One cup of Indian meal, two cups of rye, one cup of molasses, two cups of milk, half teaspoonful of soda, the same of salt. Stir well together and steam three hours, taking care that the water does not stop boiling. Add boiling water as the water boils away. If you wish it hot for breakfast, steam the day before, and in the morning set it in the oven for half an hour to form a good crust.</p>

<hd align="center">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>This work has been compiled with a careful regard to the most economical mode of preparing the various dishes for which directions have been given; and is particularly recommended to the attention of those who would cook well at a moderate expense. Many of the receipts are new, having been prepared, or furnished, expressly for this work. Selections have also been made from various works on this subject, such as have been proved to be good by use.</p>
<p>The Medicinal Department will be found to contain a select number of useful and tried remedies for the various ills and accidents that occur in almost every family. Although not intended as a substitute for the family physician, still, there are times when his attendance or advice cannot be had at the moment when most needed. It is then that the receipts in this department will be found to be of some service.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we would tender our thanks to those friends who have kindly furnished some of their choice and valuable receipts; and of those into whose hands our little work may come, we would bespeak a fair trial before passing judgment against it.</p>

<hd align="center">ADVERTISEMENT<lb/>TO THE SECOND EDITION.</hd>
<p>ENCOURAGED by the very favorable reception that our humble labors have met, in the rapid sale of the first edition, of fifteen hundred copies, in about fifteen weeks, and the demand still continuing, we have improved the time by endeavoring to make the present edition more worthy of patronage, if possible, than the first.</p>
<p>We have thoroughly revised the work by leaving out such receipts as were not of practical utility, have improved many that have been retained, and have added more than <emph rend="italic">fifty new ones,</emph> which have been tried and proved to be good and economical. We have also improved the Medicinal Department, which we consider as valuable as any part of the book, by giving several additional articles.</p>

<section class1="breadsweets" id="a001">
<hd align="center" size="larger">1. Ripe Bread.</hd>
<p>BREAD made of wheat flour, when taken out of the oven, is unprepared for the stomach. It should go through a change, or ripen, before it is eaten. Young persons, or persons in the enjoyment of vigorous health, may eat bread immediately after being baked, without any sensible injury from it; but weakly and aged persons cannot, and none can eat such, without doing harm to the digestive organs. Bread, after being baked, goes through a change similar to the change in newly-brewed beer, or newly-churned buttermilk, neither being healthy until after the change. During the change in bread, it sends off a large portion of <emph rend="italic">carbon,</emph> or unhealthy gas, and imbibes a large portion of <emph rend="italic">oxygen,</emph> or healthy gas. Bread has, according to the computation of physicians, one fifth more nutriment in it when ripe, than it has when just out of the oven. It not only has more nutriment, but imparts a much greater degree of cheerfulness. He that eats old ripe bread will have a much greater flow of animal spirits than he would were he to eat unripe bread. Bread, as before observed, discharges carbon, and imbibes oxygen. One thing, in connection with this thought, should be particularly noticed by all housewives. It is, to let the bread ripen where it can inhale the oxygen in a pure state. Bread will always taste of the air that surrounds it while ripening - hence it should ripen where the air is pure. It should never ripen in a cellar, nor in a close cupboard, nor in a bedroom. The noxious vapors of a cellar, or a cupboard, never should enter into and form a part of the bread we eat. Bread should be
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=18"/>
<emph rend="italic">light, well baked, and properly ripened,</emph> before it should be eaten.</p>
<p>Bread that is several days old may be renewed, so as to have all the freshness and lightness of new bread, by simply putting it into a common <implement>steamer</implement> over a fire, and steaming it half or three quarters of an hour. The vessel under the <implement>steamer,</implement> containing the water, should not be more than half full; otherwise the water may boil up into the <implement>steamer,</implement> and wet the bread. After the bread is thus steamed, it should be taken out of the <implement>steamer,</implement> and wrapped loosely in a cloth, to dry and cool, and remain so a short time, when it will be ready to be cut and used. It will then be like cold, new bread.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" size="larger" placement="heading">2. Potato Bread.</purpose>

Take a dozen and a half of good mealy <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> well boiled; peel them, and mash them fine while warm; add two quarts of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and then strain the mixture through a <implement>colander;</implement> add <ingredient>flour</ingredient> enough to make a thick batter; then a pint of good <ingredient>lively yeast;</ingredient> if the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is sweet, no <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> is necessary; if sour, a very little <ingredient>saleratus;</ingredient> let the sponge set, until it is well fermented. With this sponge you may make a large or a small quantity of bread by adding <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> if a small quantity, it may be put into the oven very soon; if the quantity be large, it must stand longer, or over night. Put in double the usual quantity of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> but no shortening. Let the dough stand in a place moderately warm, but not near the fire, unless it is to be baked immediately. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be used, but <ingredient>water</ingredient> is the best, for the sponge mixed with <ingredient>water</ingredient> keeps sweet the longest. The bread will be very light, sweet, and wholesome, having in it neither acids nor alkalies, to neutralize each other. The greater the proportion of <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> the lighter the bread will be; but if the proportion is very large, the bread will be so light as to dry up, if kept several days.</p>

To have good yeast in summer is a desirable object with every housewife. She may have such, by the following simple process:--</p>
<p>Boil a single handful of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> (which every farmer can and ought to raise, to the extent of household wants) in two or three quarts of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> strain and thicken the liquor, when hot, with <ingredient>rye flour;</ingredient> then add two or three small <ingredient>yeast cakes,</ingredient> to set the mass. If this is done at evening, it will be fit for use early next morning. Reserve a pint of this yeast, which thicken with <ingredient>Indian meal,</ingredient> make into small cakes the size of crackers, and dry them in the shade for future use. In this way the yeast is always fresh and active. Yeast cakes kept a long time are apt to become rancid, and lose their virtues. The fresher the cakes, the better the yeast.</p>

<p>Bread that is kept in a damp place, or not used soon after a heavy rain, is apt to collect a kind of moss or mould. This can be easily prevented, by mixing a small quantity of arrow-root with the flour, before the dough is ready for the oven. It is also useful in preparing sea biscuit for long voyages.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">109. Observations on making Puddings.</hd>
<p>The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes disagreeably, which arises by the cloth not being nicely washed, and kept in a dry place. It should be dipped in boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured, when to be used. If bread, it should be tied loose; if batter, tight over. The water should boil quick when the pudding is put in; and it should be moved about for a minute, lest the ingredients should not mix. Batter pudding should be strained through a coarse sieve, when all is mixed; in others, the eggs separately. The pans and basins must be always buttered. A pan of cold water should be ready, and the pudding dipped in as soon as it comes out of the pot, and then it will not adhere to the cloth.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">185. Heating the Oven.</hd>
<p>* For pies, cakes, and white bread, the heat of the oven should be such, that you can hold your hand and arm in while you count forty: for brown bread, meats, beans, Indian puddings, and pumpkin pies, it should be hotter, so that you can only hold it in while you count twenty.</p>
</section>
<section id="a186" class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" size="larger">186. Roasting Meats.</hd>
<p>The first preparation for roasting is to take care that the spit be properly cleansed with sand and water; nothing else. When it has been well scoured with this, dry it with a clean cloth. If spits are wiped clean as soon as the meat is drawn from them, and while they are hot, a very little cleaning will be required.</p>
<p>Make up the fire in time. Let it be proportioned to the dinner to be dressed, and about three or four inches longer at each end than the thing to be roasted, or the ends of the meat cannot be done nice and brown.</p>
<p>A cook must be as particular to proportion her fire to the business she has to do as a chemist: the degree of heat most desirable for dressing the different sorts of food ought to be attended to with the utmost precision.</p>
<p>Never put meat down to a burned-up fire, if you can possibly avoid it; but should the fire become fierce, place the spit at a considerable distance, and allow a little more time.</p>
<p>Preserve the fat by covering it with paper for this purpose, called <implement>"kitchen paper,"</implement> and tie it on with a fine twine. Pins and skewers can by no means be allowed; they are so many taps to let out the gravy; besides, the paper often starts from them and catches fire, to the great injury of the meat.</p>
<p>If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, the fire should be little and brisk. When you have a large joint to roast, make up a sound, strong fire, equally good in every part, or your meat cannot be equally roasted, nor have that uniform color which constitutes the beauty of good roasting.</p>
<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=50"/>
<p>Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy, and just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire, to brown it. If you wish to froth it, paste it, and dredge it with flour carefully; you cannot do this delicacy nice without a very good light. The common fault seems to be, using too much flour. The meat should have a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of being covered with a paste. Those who are particular about the froth use butter instead of drippings.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">187. Baking Meats.</hd>
<p>Baking is one of the cheapest and most convenient ways of dressing a dinner in small families; and I may say, that the oven is often the only kitchen a poor man has, if he wishes to enjoy a joint of meat.</p>
<p>I do not mean to deny the superior excellence of roasting to baking; but some joints, when baked, so nearly approach to the same when roasted, that I have known them to be carried to the table and eaten as such with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton, fillets of veal, and many other joints, will bake to great advantage, if the meat be good; I mean well-fed, rather inclined to be fat; if the meat be poor, no baking can give satisfaction.</p>

<p>Take care to prepare your fire in time, so that it may burn quite clear; a brisk, clear fire is indispensable, or you cannot give your meat that browning which constitutes the perfection of this mode of cookery, and gives a relish to food it cannot receive in any other way.</p>
<p>The chops or slices should be from half to three quarters of an inch in thickness; if thicker, they will be done too much on the outside before the inside is done enough.</p>
<p>Be diligently attentive to watch the moment that any thing is done: never hasten any thing that is broiling, lest you make smoke and spoil it.</p>
<p>Let the bars of the <implement>gridiron</implement> be all hot through, but yet not burning hot upon the surface; this is the perfect and fine condition of the <implement>gridiron.</implement></p>
<p><implement>Upright gridirons</implement> are the best, as they can be used at any fire without fear of smoke; and the gravy is preserved in the trough under them.</p>

<hd size="larger" align="center">189. Boiling Meats.</hd>
<p>This most simple of culinary processes is not often performed in perfection. It does not require quite so much
<pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=52"/>
nicety and attention as roasting. To skim the pot well, and keep it really boiling (the slower the better) all the while, to know how long is required for doing the joint, &amp;c., and to take it up at the critical moment when it is done enough, comprehends almost the whole art and mystery. This, however, demands a patient and perpetual vigilance, of which few persons are capable.</p>
<p>The cook must take especial care that the water really boils all the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived in the time; and make up a sufficient fire at first to last all the time, without much mending or stirring. A frugal cook will manage with much less fire for boiling than she uses for roasting.</p>
<p>When the pot is coming to the boil, there will always, from the cleanest meat and the cleanest water, rise a <emph rend="italic">scum</emph> to the top of it, proceeding partly from the water; this must be carefully taken off as soon as it rises.</p>
<p>On this depends the good appearance of all boiled things. When you have skimmed well, put in some cold water, which will throw up the rest of the scum.</p>
<p>The oftener it is skimmed, and the cleaner the top of the water is kept, the sweeter and the cleaner will be the meat.</p>
<p>If left alone, it soon boils down and sticks to the meat, which, instead of looking delicately white and nice, will have that coarse and filthy appearance we have too often to complain of, and the butcher and poulterer be blamed for the carelessness of the cook in not skimming her pot.</p>
<p>Many put in <emph rend="italic">milk,</emph> to make what they boil look white; but this does more harm than good. Others wrap it up in a cloth; but these are needless precautions. If the scum be attentively removed, meat will have much more delicate color and finer flavor than it has when muffled up. This may give rather more trouble, but those who wish to excel in their art must only consider how the processes of it can be most perfectly performed. A cook who has a proper pride and pleasure in her business, will make this her maxim on all occasions.</p>
<p>It is desirable that meat for boiling be of an equal thickness, or, before thicker parts are done enough, the thinner will be done too much.</p>
<p>Put your meat into <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water, in proportions of about a quart of water to a pound of meat; it should be covered
<pb n="49" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=53"/>
with water during the whole process of boiling, but not drowned in it; the less water, provided the meat be covered with it, the more savory will be the meat, and the better will be the broth.</p>
<p>The water should be heated gradually, according to the thickness, &amp;c., of the article boiled. For instance, a leg of mutton of ten pounds' weight, should be placed over a moderate fire, which will gradually make the water hot, without causing it to boil for about forty minutes. If the water boils much sooner, the meat will be hardened, and shrink up, as if it was scorched. By keeping the water a certain time heating, without boiling, the fibres of the meat are dilated, and it yields a quantity of scum, which must be taken off as soon as it rises.</p>
<p>The old rule of fifteen minutes to a pound of meat, we think rather too little; the slower it boils, the tenderer, the plumper, and whiter it will be.</p>
<p>For those who choose their food thoroughly cooked, (which all will, who have any regard for their stomachs,) twenty minutes to a pound for fresh, and rather more for salted meat, will not be found too much for gentle simmering by the side of the fire, allowing more or less time, according to the thickness of the joint and the coldness of the weather; to know the state of which, let a thermometer be placed in the pantry; and when it falls below forty degrees, give rather more time in both roasting and boiling, always remembering, the slower it boils the better.</p>
<p>Without some practice it is difficult to teach any art; and cooks seem to suppose they must be right, if they put meat into a pot, and set it over the fire for a certain time, making no allowance whether it simmers without a bubble or boils at a gallop.</p>
<p>Fresh-killed meat will take much longer time, in boiling, than that which has been kept till it is what the butchers call <emph rend="italic">ripe;</emph> and longer in <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> than in <emph rend="italic">warm</emph> weather; if it be <emph rend="italic">frozen,</emph> it must be thawed before boiling as before roasting; if it be fresh killed, it will be tough and hard, if you stew it ever so gently. In cold weather, the night before the day you dress it, bring it into a place of which the temperature is not less than forty-five degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>
<p>The size of the <implement>boiling-pots</implement> should be adapted to what
<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=54"/>
they are to contain; the larger the saucepan, the more room it takes upon the fire, and a larger quantity of water requires a proportionate increase of fire to boil it.</p>
<p>In small families we recommend <implement>block-tin saucepans,</implement> &amp;c., as lightest and safest. If proper care be taken of them, and they are well cleaned, they are by far the cheapest--the purchase of a new tin saucepan being little more than the expense of tinning a copper one.</p>
<p>Let the covers of your <implement>boiling-pots</implement> fit close, not only to prevent unnecessary evaporation of the water, but to prevent the escape of the nutritive matter, which must then remain either in the meat or in the broth; and the smoke is prevented from insinuating itself under the edge of the lid, and so giving the meat a bad taste.</p>

<section class1="meatfishgame" id="a190">
<hd align="center" size="larger">190. Frying Meats.</hd>
<p>Frying is often a convenient mode of cookery. It may be performed by a fire which will not do for roasting or boiling; and by the introduction of a pan between the meat and the fire, things get more equally dressed; good frying is, in fact, boiling in fat. To make sure that the pan is quite clean, rub a little fat over it, and then make it warm, and wipe it out with a clean cloth.</p>
<p>For general purposes, and especially for fish, pork fat is preferable to lard.</p>
<p>To know when the fat is of a proper heat, according to what you are to fry, is the real secret in frying.</p>
<p>To fry fish, potatoes, or any thing that is watery, your fire must be very clear, and the fat quite hot; which you may be pretty sure of, when it has done hissing, and is still. We cannot insist too strongly on this point; if the fat is not very hot, you cannot fry fish either to a good color, or firm and crisp.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">191. Soups.</hd>
<p>To extract the strength from the meat, long and slow boiling is necessary; but care must be taken that the pot is never off the boil. All soups are better for being made the day before they are to be used, and they should then be strained into earthen pans. When soup has jellied in the pan, it should not be removed into another, as breaking it will occasion its becoming sour sooner than it

<hd align="center" size="larger">226. Curing Meat.</hd>
<p>The difference between doing a thing right, and doing it wrong, is perhaps nowhere more obviously shown than in curing salted provisions. There are few people who do not relish a slice of nice ham or corned beef; and many a good housewife can speak of the various advantages, in the mysteries of cookery, which belong to well-cured, clear, pickled pork. It is a very easy matter to have all
<pb n="59" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=63"/>
these things of good quality; yet it is too often the case that we find them put up or managed in so careless a manner, that they are actually unwholesome, or in such condition that they can only be eaten by persons of the strongest appetites.</p>
<recipe region="northeast" class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose>HAMS.</purpose>

--For every one hundred pounds of meat, take five pints of good <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> (or five pounds of <ingredient>brown sugar,</ingredient>) five ounces of <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and eight pounds of <ingredient>rock salt</ingredient>--add three gallons of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and boil the ingredients over a gentle fire, skimming off the froth or scum as it rises. Continue the boiling till the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> &amp;c., is dissolved. Have the <ingredient>hams,</ingredient> nicely cut and trimmed, packed in <implement>casks</implement> with the shank-end down, as the pickle will thus strike in better. When the pickle, prepared as above, is sufficiently cool, pour it over the <ingredient>hams.</ingredient> They may lie in pickle from two to six weeks, according to the size of the pieces of the state of the weather, more time being required in cold than in warm weather. <variation><purpose>Beef or mutton hams,</purpose>

intended for smoking and drying, may be cured according to this mode, and will be found excellent.</variation> Much of the goodness of <ingredient>hams</ingredient> depends on smoking. They should be hung at such a distance from the fire as not to be heated. They should be hung up with the shank-end downward, as this will prevent the escape of their juices by dripping. Small <ingredient>hams,</ingredient> wanted for immediate use, will answer with two weeks' smoking; but larger ones, and those wanted for keeping, should be smoked four weeks or more.</p>
<p>Different articles are used for smoking. Perhaps saw-dust from hard wood, where it can be conveniently had, is, on the whole, to be preferred. Corn-cobs are first rate, and are said by some to make the "sweetest" smoke of any thing. Chips of maple and hickory, or the small twigs and branches of those kinds of wood, do well.</p>
<p><variation>Another mode which we have seen practised is to <emph rend="italic">smoke the barrels or <implement>casks</implement></emph> in which the hams are to be kept, and let them remain in pickle till wanted; only taking them out a sufficiently long time, before using, to allow them to drain properly.

<p><variation>Another mode, recommended by a gentleman of long experience in the packing of beef and pork, is the following: For one hundred pounds <ingredient>beef</ingredient> take four pounds <ingredient>brown sugar,</ingredient> four ounces <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and four quarts of <ingredient>fine Liverpool salt;</ingredient> mix all intimately together, and in packing, sprinkle it evenly over the meat. Add no pickle; the dissolving of the salt, &amp;c., with the juices of the meat, will be sufficient. Keep the meat closely pressed together by a good weight.

<p>If a child's or any person's clothes should happen to be set fire to, they ought never to open the door and rush out into the street, but to lie down immediately, and, if they can, to roll themselves in a rug, carpet, coat, cloak, or any other woollen article which may be near. If any other persons are present, they should assist in doing the same, as the readiest way of putting out the flame. The reason is plain. By running about through the air, you fan the flame, and make it blaze more fiercely; whereas the object should be to smother it. Do not drag the sufferer to a pump, or tear off the burnt clothes roughly; but, having extinguished the flames, remove the clothes as gently as possible, and then sprinkle flour over the burnt part of the body, the great object being to keep the air from it as much as possible. Medical direction should, of course, be procured as quick as possible.</p>

<hd align="center">340. To keep Apples for Winter Use.</hd>
<p>Put them in <implement>casks</implement> or bins, in layers well covered with dry sand, each layer being covered. This preserves them from air, from moisture, and from frost; it prevents their perishing by their own perspiration, their moisture being absorbed by the sand; at the same time it preserves the flavor of the apples, and prevents their wilting. Pippins have been kept in this manner sound and fresh till mid-summer; and how much longer they would have kept is not known. Any kind of sand will answer, but it must be pefectly dry.</p>
<p>If apples are immersed in grain of any kind, they will keep good all the year round, and the grain will not in any way be the worse for it. This does not need any preparation or expense, as the apples may be put into a corn-bin, or into a tub, and the corn intended for food for horses or poultry may as well be stored in this way as any other.</p>

<p>If a man, twenty-one years of age, begin to save a dollar a week, and put it to interest every year, he would have, at thirty-one years of age, six hundred and fifty dollars; at forty-one, one thousand six hundred and eighty; at sixty-one, six thousand one hundred and fifty; and at seventy-one, eleven thousand five hundred dollars. When we look at the sums, and when we think how much temptation and evil might be avoided in the very act of saving them, and how much good a man in humble circumstances might do for his family by these sums, we cannot help wondering that there are not more savers of one dollar a week.</p>

<hd align="center">400. Family Tool Closet: by Miss Leslie.</hd>
<p>Much inconvenience and considerable expense would be saved, if it was the universal custom to keep in every house a few tools for the purpose of performing at home what are called small jobs; instead of being always obliged to send for a mechanic, and pay him for executing little things that might be sufficiently well done by a man or boy belonging to the family provided that the proper instruments were at hand. The cost of these articles is very trifling, and the advantages of having them in the house, (particularly in the country,) are beyond
<pb n="106" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=108"/>
all price. In a small private family, it may not be necessary to keep more than a few of these things; but those few are almost indispensable to comfort. For instance, there should be an axe, a saw, (a wood-saw also, where wood is burned,) a claw-hammer, a mallet, a gimblet, a screw-driver, a small plane, a carpet-fork or stretcher, one or two jack-knives, a pair of large scissors or shears, and a trowel. If there were two gimblets and two screw-drivers, (large and small,) it would be better still. Also, an assortment of hooks and nails of different sizes, from large spikes down to small tacks, not forgetting a portion of brass-headed nails, some large and some smaller. Screws, also, will be found very convenient. The nails and screws should be kept in a wooden box, with divisions or partitions to separate the various sorts, for it is very troublesome to have them mixed.</p>
<p>No house should be without glue, chalk, putty, paint, cord, twine, and wrapping-paper; and care should be taken that the supply is not suffered to run out, lest the deficiency might cause delay and inconveninece at a time when most wanted.</p>
<p>It is well to have, in the lower part of the house, a deep closet, appropriated entirely to tools and things of equal utility, for executing at once such little repairs as convenience may require, without the delay or expense of sending for an artisan. This closet should have only one large shelf, and that not more than three feet above the floor. Beneath the shelf may contain cakes of glue, pieces of chalk, hanks of manilla-grass cord, and balls of twine of different size and quality. There may be small shelves at the sides of the closet for glue-pots, paste-pots, and brushes; pots for black, white, green, and red paint, cans of painting oil, &amp;c. On the wall above the large shelf let the tools be suspended, or laid across nails or hooks of proper size to support them. This is much better than to keep them in a box, where they may be injured by rubbing against each other, and the hand may be hurt by feeling among them to find the one that is wanted. When hung against the closet-wall, each tool may be seen at a glance. We have been shown an excellent and simple contrivance, for designating the exact places of these things. On the wall directly under the nails that support the tools, is
<pb n="107" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=109"/>
drawn, with a small brush dipped in black paint or ink, an outline representation of the tool or intstrument appropriated to that particular place. For instance, under each saw is sketched the outline of a saw; under each gimlet is a sketch of a gimlet; under the screw-drivers are slight drawings of screw-drivers: so that when any tool is taken away for use, and afterwards brought back again, the exact spot to which it belongs may be found in a moment; and all confusion in putting them up, and finding them again, is this prevented. We highly recommend this plan.</p>
<p>Wrapping-paper may be piled on the floor under the large shelf. It can be bought very low, by the ream, at the wholesale paper stores; and each house should be supplied with it in several varieties. For instance, coarse brownish paper for common things. That denominated ironmonger's paper, which is strong, thick, and in large sheets, is useful for enclosing heavy articles. Nankeen paper is best for putting up nice parcels, such as books and things of fine quality. What is called shoe-paper (each ream containing a variety of colors, red, blue, white, and buff) is very useful also for wrapping nice articles, as it is soft, and not brittle. This paper is cheapest of all.</p>
<p>Old waste newspapers are unfit for wrapping any other articles other than glass, china, brass, and tin--things whose surfaces are so hard and polished that the printing-ink does not rub off on them--also can be easily washed. Waste newspapers had best be used for lighting fires, singeing poultry, and cleaning windows and mirrors. Waste written paper is of little use but for allumettes, or lamp-lighters. It is well to keep a large jar, or bag, to receive scraps of old paper, as it cells for a cent a pound; and those cents may be given to a poor person.</p>
<p>We have seen people, when preparing for a journey, or putting up things to send away, "at their wit's end" for want of a sheet of good wrapping-paper, a string of twine, a few nails, or a little paint to mark a box. We have seen a door kept open during the whole of a cold day and a cold night, for want of a screw-driver, to fix a disordered lock. It seems scarcely credible that any respectable house should be without a hammer; yet we have known persons whose sole dependence for that 
<pb n="108" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=econ&#38;PageNum=110"/>
indespensable article was on borrowing of a neighbor. And when the hammer was obtained, there were perhaps no nails in the house of the size that was wanted.</p>
<p>The attention of boys should be early directed to the use of common tools. And if they had tools at hand, there are few boys, in our country, that would not take pleasure in using them. By seeing carpenters, glaziers, locksmiths, and bell-hangers, at work, they may very soon learn to be passably expert in these arts; and frequently a smart and observant boy will acquire great amateur proficiency in them. In a house where, among other tools, there will always a glazier's diamond, knife, &amp;c., we have seen a pane of glass put into a broken window as neatly as if done by a professor of the art.</p>
<p>We have known boys who could make a box, or a bench, or a little table; who could hang and repair bell-wires, mend locks and hinges, paper or paint a small room, mend a broken window-cord, re-lay a brick hearth, repair the yard pavement;--and find great amusement in doing these things.</p>
<p>We once knew a family of four boys living in Philadelphia, who entirely, and with their own hands, built for themselves, in a large yard, what they called a play-house; that is, a house to play in when the weather was bad. It was a one-story, one-room structure, made of boards, with a shingle roof. It had a well-fitted door, and two glazed windows; and they papered the walls of the room with newspapers.</p>
