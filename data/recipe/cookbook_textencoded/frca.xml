<hd>CHAP. III.<lb/>OF BOILING.</hd>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="italic">General Rules to be observed in Boiling.</hd>
<p>BE very careful that your pots and covers are well tinned, very clean, and free from sand. Mind that your pot really boils all the while; otherwise you will be disappointed in dressing any joint, though it has been a proper time over the fire. Fresh meat should be put in when the water boils, and salt meat whilst it is cold. Take care likewise to have sufficient room and water in the pot, and allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of meat, let it weigh more or less.</p>

When your meat is put in, and the pot boils, take care to scum it very clean, otherwise the scum will boil down, stick to your meat, and make it look black. Send up your dish with turnips, greens, potatoes, or carrots. <variation>If it is a leg or loin of mutton, you may also put melted butter and capers in a boat.</variation></p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">To boil Potatoes.</purpose>

<ingredient>Potatoes</ingredient> must always be peeled, except they be very small and new. Some pare potatoes before they are put into the pot; others think it the best way, both for saving time and preventing waste, to peel off the skin as soon as they are boiled, which then slips off by rubbing them with a coarse cloth. In boiling them take care they be enough, and not over done; for if boiled too much, they mash and become watery. Therefore it requires good attention when you are boiling potatoes, and that they be taken up as soon
<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=frca&#38;PageNum=71"/>
as they begin to show the least disposition to break. This is a root in great request, and served up in a dish or plate, whole for the most part, with a bason of melted butter. On which occasion it will be some addition to the potatoes to set them before the fire till they are quite dry, and a little browned.</p>
