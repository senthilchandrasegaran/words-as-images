<hd size="larger" rend="bold" align="center">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>It has been the aim of the author, in the following pages to point out as clearly as the limits of the work permitted, the nature of the different kinds of aliment provided by the wise and benevolent Creator for the sustenance of His rational creatures, and to show the best methods of preparation now understood.</p>
<p>Foreigners say that our climate is unhealthy; that the Americans have, generally, thin forms, sallow complexions and bad teeth.</p>
<p>Is it not most likely that these defects are incurred, in part if not wholly, because the diet and modes of living are unsuitable to the climate, and consequently to the health of the people?</p>
<p>Could public attention be drawn to this important subject sufficiently to have a reform in a few points--such as using <emph rend="italic">animal food</emph> to excess, eating <emph rend="italic">hot bread,</emph> and swallowing our meals with steam-engine rapidity, the question of climate might more easily be settled.</p>
<p>This little work is intended to show the rich how they may preserve their health and yet enjoy the bounties of Providence; and teach the poor that frugal management which will make their homes the abode of comfort. Such rational and Christian views of domestic economy have never before been enforced in a treatise on housekeeping; and the writer flatters herself that this will be well received. The book has been several years in contemplation; various circumstances have retarded the publication, but the times seemed now to call for its appearance. May it do good, is the sincere wish of the<emph rend="bold" align="right">AUTHOR.</emph><lb/>BOSTON, SEPT. 1, 1839.</p>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">THE GOOD HOUSEKEEPER.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">CHAPTER I.</hd>
<hd rend="bold" align="center">INTRODUCTORY.</hd>
<p>Bodily health, satisfied appetite, and peace of mind, are great promoters of individual morality and public tranquility.--DR. COMBE.</p>
<p>THE main object of those who have prepared works on cookery, has been to teach the art of <emph rend="italic">good living,</emph> or of <emph rend="italic">cheap living;</emph>--the "Cook's Oracle" is one of the best examples of the first purpose, the "Frugal Housewife" of the last.</p>
<p>My aim is to select and combine the excellences of these two systems, at the same time keeping in view the important object of preserving health, and thus teach <emph rend="italic">how to live well, and to be well while we live.</emph></p>
<p>The physiology of digestion and the principles of dietetics, as laid down and explained by Dr Andrew Combe, of Edinburgh, form the basis of my plan, which will inculcate temperance in all things, but rarely enforce total abstinence from anything which the Creator has sanctioned as proper food for mankind.</p>
<p>I follow chiefly the system of Dr Combe, because, though I have examined many popular works on Diet, Health, &amp;c., and have found much to commend, and some things to adopt from these writers, yet he defines, with most clearness and precision, those rules of living, which my own experience has taught me are good and judicious. Indeed, in most cases, even when I may quote the language of Dr Combe, I still write what I know to be true.</p>
<p>I have been a housekeeper, both in the country and the city, and have had a practical knowledge of those rules of 
 
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=22"/>

domestic economy which I shall recommend. And I have brought up a family of children, without the loss, or hardly the sickness of one of them, during infancy and childhood. I can, therefore, claim some experience in a successful manner of managing the health and constitution of the young.</p>
<p>As our bodily health, and, of consequence, our happiness and usefulness in domestic and social life, depend very much on the proper quantity of food we eat, and the time and circumstances under which it is taken, I shall give a few hints on these subjects, before laying down rules for the preparation and quality of the food.</p>
<hd align="center">TIMES OF TAKING FOOD.</hd>
<p>Nature has fixed no particular hours for eating. When the mode of life is uniform, it is of great importance to adopt fixed hours; when it is irregular, we ought to be guided by the real wants of the system as dictated by appetite.</p>
<p>A strong laboring man, engaged in hard work, will require food oftener and in larger quantities than an indolent or sedentary man.</p>
<p>As a general rule, about five hours should elapse between one meal and another--longer if the mode of life be indolent, shorter if it be very active.</p>
<p>When dinner is delayed seven or eight hours after breakfast, some slight refreshment should be taken between.</p>
<p>Young persons, when growing fast, require more food and at shorter intervals than those do who have attained maturity.</p>
<p>Children, under seven years of age, usually need food every three hours; a piece of bread will be a healthy lunch, and a child seldom eats bread to excess.</p>
<p>During the first months of infancy there can be no set times of giving nourishment. Different constitutions require different management. The best rule is to satisfy the real wants of the child, but never tempt it to take food to still its crying from pain, when it is not hungry.</p>
<p>Those persons who eat a late supper should not take breakfast till one or two hours after rising. Those who dine 
 
<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=23"/>

late, and eat nothing afterwards, require breakfast soon after rising.</p>
<p>Persons of a delicate constitution should never exercise much before breakfast.</p>
<p>If exposure of any kind is to be incurred in the morning, breakfast should always be taken previously. The system is more susceptible of infection and of the influence of cold, miasma, &amp;c., in the morning before eating, than at any other time.</p>
<p>Those who walk early will find great benefit from taking a cracker or some little nourishment before going out.</p>
<p>Never go into a room of a morning, where a person is sick with a fever, before you have taken nourishment of some kind--a cup of coffee, at least.</p>
<p>In setting out early to travel, a light breakfast before starting should always be taken; it is a great protection against cold, fatigue and exhaustion.</p>
<p>In boarding schools for the young and growing, early breakfast is an indispensable condition to health. Children should not be kept without food in the morning till they are faint and weary.</p>
<p>Never eat a hearty supper just before retiring to rest.</p>
<p>It is injurious to eat when greatly heated or fatigued. It would very much conduce to the health of laboring men if they could rest fifteen or twenty minutes before dinner.</p>
<hd align="center">PROPER QUANTITY OF FOOD.</hd>
<p>As a general fact, mankind eat much more than is required for their sustenance.</p>
<p>Nearly one half of the diseases and deaths, occuring during the first two years of existence, are owing to mismanagement and errors in diet.</p>
<p>Children should never be fed or tempted to eat when appetite is satisfied; and grown persons should also be careful of eating beyond that point.</p>
<p>The indigestion so much complained of, and which causes so many disorders and sufferings in the human system, is a wise provision of nature, to prevent the repletion which would otherwise ensue, when too much food is taken.</p>
 
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=24"/>

<p>The power of digestion is limited to the amount of gastric juice the stomach is capable of providing; exercise, in the open air, promotes the secretion of the gastric juice.</p>
<p>It is a good and safe rule to proportion our meals to the amount of exercise we have taken; if that exercise has been in the open air, there is less danger of excess. The delicate lady, who scarcely walks abroad, should live very sparingly, or she will be troubled with nervousness, headache, and all the horrors of indigestion.</p>
<p>Young persons, when growing, should have plenty of food; if they are active and healthy, and the food is of a proper kind and well prepared, there is little danger of their taking too much. But never tempt their appetites by delicacies when plain food is not relished.</p>
<p>When the growth is attained, and active exercises are, in a great measure abandoned--as is the case with females, particularly,--then be very careful to regulate the appetite, and never take such a quantity of food at a time, as to oppress or disturb the stomach. Remember that food which does not digest cannot nourish the system, but rather weakens it.</p>
<p>Variety of food is chiefly dangerous because it tempts to excess; otherwise it is beneficial. The gastric juice acts more easily where the contents of the stomach are of different kinds of food mixed together. Let no person think he is <emph rend="italic">certainly temperate</emph> because he eats of but <emph rend="italic">one</emph> dish. It is more hurtful to take too much of that one, than though he had eaten the same quantity of several.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when food does not agree with the stomach, it is a sign that too much has been taken.</p>
<hd align="center">WHAT IS THE PROPER FOOD OF MAN?</hd>
<p>No certain rules can be given respecting the kind of food to be taken. The same diet which is healthful for an adult will be injurious for a child. The stimulating animal diet which in winter is necessary for a laboring man, would be destructive to an inactive and excitable man during the summer months.</p>
<p>Food should be adapted to the age, constitution, state of health and mode of life of the individual; to the climate, and the season of the year.</p>
 
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=25"/>

<p>The milk of the mother ought, in every instance to constitute the food of the infant, unless such an arrangement is impracticable. After the child is weaned, fresh cow's milk, in which a small portion of soft water has been mingled, and sometimes a little sugar, with a small quantity of crust of bread softened, is usually the most healthy food; but this should be varied by occasional meals of gruel, arrow-root, or sago, and if the child is delicate and shows signs of acidity or flatulence, then a preparation of weak chicken broth or beef tea, freed from fat, and thickened with soft boiled rice may be given.</p>
<p>The same kind of food ought to be continued, with the addition of good bread (and potatoes when well cooked seem as healthy food nearly as bread), till the appearance of the "eye teeth;" when these are fairly through, a portion of soft-boiled egg, and occasionally a little meat, the lean part, well cooked and not highly seasoned, may be given.</p>
<p>There is great danger of over-feeding young children with animal food. If given too early and too freely, it irritates the system and greatly aggravates the diseases of infancy.</p>
<p>Ripe fruits should never be given to children till they have teeth, and unripe fruits ought never to be eaten.</p>
<p>During childhood and early youth, the breakfast and supper should consist principally of bread and milk, ripe fruits and vegetable food; it will be sufficient to allow a portion of animal food with the dinner.</p>
<p>Fish, chicken, and other white meats are best for children. Fat pork is nearly indigestible for the young and delicate, and ought never to be eaten by them.</p>
<p>Pastry, rich cakes, plum-puddings, hot short-cakes, and all the family of fried cakes, are the most generally indigestible of all kinds of food. These should rarely be eaten, except by the strong and actively employed, and sparingly even by those.</p>
<p>In truth, there are few articles of diet which a person in health, and leading a very active life, may not eat without feeling much inconvenience, still a preference should be given, as far as possible, to such kinds of food as are most in accordance with the natural constitution. A phlegmatic 
 
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=26"/>

temperament requires a mild, nutritious diet, but not the same amount of animal food as may be needed by the sanguine, which inclines to great physical activity. Those in whom the brain and nervous system predominate, should avoid a stimulating diet, unless they are in the habit of taking considerable muscular exercise. If it be the wish to rouse a phlegmatic organization to greater activity, then use a richer diet, more animal food--but be sure and take exercise at the same time, or it will prove highly injurious. The natural temperament may be essentially altered by diet and exercise.</p>
<p>Rich soups are injurious to the dispeptic. Much liquid food is rarely beneficial for adults; but a small quantity of plain nourishing soup is an economic and healthy beginning of a family dinner.</p>
<p>Meats should always be sufficiently cooked. It is a savage custom to eat meat in a half-raw-half-roasted state, and only a very strong stomach can digest it.</p>
<p>Rich gravies should be avoided, especially in the summer season.</p>
<p>Butter is not a healthy article of diet in hot weather--in winter it is nutritious and generally beneficial; but for young children it is not a good article of diet. Rancid butter is very unhealthy.</p>
<p>Pepper, ginger, and most of the condiments, are best during summer; they are productions of hot climates, which shows them to be most appropriate for the hot season. On the other hand, fat beef, bacon, and those kinds of food we denominate "hearty," should be most freely used during cold weather.</p>
<p>The diet should always be more spare, with a larger proportion of vegetables and ripe fruits, during summer. Fruits are most wholesome in their appropriate season. The skins, stones, and seeds, are indigestible.</p>
<p>Food should never be taken when it is hot--bread is very unhealthy when eaten in this way.</p>
<p>Eat slowly. One of the most usual causes of dispepsia among our business men, arises from the haste in which they swallow their food, without sufficiently chewing it, and then hurry away to their active pursuits. In England very little business is transacted after dinner. There 
 
<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=27"/>

ought to be, at least, one hour of quiet after a full meal, from those pursuits which tax the brain as well as those which exercise the muscles.</p>
<hd align="center">WHAT SHALL WE DRINK?</hd>
<p>Why water--that is a safe drink for all constitutions and all ages,--provided persons only use it when they are naturally thirsty. But do not drink heartily of cold water when heated or greatly fatigued. A cup of warm tea will better allay the thirst, and give a feeling of comfort to the stomach which water will not.</p>
<p>Toast and water, common beer, soda-water, and other liquids of a similar kind, if they agree with the stomach, may be used freely without danger.</p>
<p>Fermented liquors, such as porter, ale, and wine, if used at all as a drink, should be very sparingly taken.</p>
<p>Distilled spirituous liquors should never be considered drinkable--they may be necessary, sometimes, as a medicine, but never, never consider them a necessary item in house-keeping. So important does it appear to me to dispense entirely with distilled spirits, as an article of domestic use, that I have not allowed a drop to enter into any of the recipes contained in this book.</p>
<p>As the primary effect of fermented liquors, cider, wine, &amp;c., is to stimulate the nervous system, and quicken the circulation, these should be utterly prohibited to children and persons of a quick temperament. In truth, unless prescribed by the physician, it would be best to abstain entirely from their use.</p>
<p>Most people drink too much, because they drink too fast. A wine-glass of water, sipped slowly, will quench the thirst as effectually as a pint swallowed at a draught. When too much is taken at meals, especially at dinner, it hinders digestion. Better drink little during the meal, and then, if thirsty an hour or two afterwards, more. The practice of taking a cup of tea or coffee soon after dinner is a good one, if the beverage be not drank too strong or too hot.</p>
<p>Dispeptic people should be careful to take but a small quantity of drink. Children require more, in proportion to their food, than adults. But it is very injurious to them to 
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=28"/>

allow a habit of continual drinking, as you find in some children. It greatly weakens the stomach, and renders them irritable and peevish.</p>
<p>The morning meal requires to be lighter and of a more fluid nature than any other. Children should always, if possible to be obtained, take milk--as a substitute, during the winter, good gruel with bread, or water sweetened with molasses is healthy. Never give children tea, coffee, or chocolate with their meals.</p>
<p>Coffee affords very little nourishment, and is apt, if drank strong, to occasion tremors of the nerves. It is very bad for bilious constitutions. The calm, phlegmatic temperament can bear it. With a good supply of cream and sugar, and drank in moderation, it may be used without much danger.</p>
<p>Strong green tea relaxes the tone of the stomach, and excites the nervous system. Persons of delicate constitution are almost sure to be injured by it. Black tea is much less deleterious. If used with milk and sugar, it may be considered healthy for most people.</p>
<p>Chocolate, when it agrees with the constitution, is very nutritious and healthy. But it seldom can be used steadily, except by aged persons who are very active. It agrees best with persons of phlegmatic temperament; and is more healthy in the winter season than during warm weather. No kind of beverage should be taken hot--it injures the teeth and impairs digestion.</p>
<p>I have now given those general rules and hints in regard to diet, which will greatly preserve the health and promote the comfort of those who follow them. Particular directions and peculiar constitutions cannot be considered or recorded in this book, which is rather intended as a manual for those who require to be instructed how to remain <emph rend="italic">well,</emph> than for the <emph rend="italic">sick.</emph> Though for these, the plan of diet here recommended, if strictly followed, will be a great relief--in most cases, a radical cure.</p>
<p>We are now to give all necessary directions for the preparation of food in accordance with these rules for health and real enjoyment. I trust that every woman will agree in sentiment with the lady in Milton's Comus--</p>

<p>Importance of good bread--Diet proper for mankind--Proofs that a mixed diet is the best--Advantages of taking a portion of animal food--Flour--Bread--Making yeast--Hints on the economy of bread making, &amp;c.</p>
<p>THE art of making <emph rend="italic">good bread</emph> I consider the most important one in cookery, and shall therefore give it the first place in the "Good Housekeeper." Not that I believe bread to contain the "quintessence of beef, mutton, veal, venison," or that an exclusive vegetable diet is best for mankind.</p>
<p>There has been of late years, much said and written respecting the benefits of adhering to a strict vegetable diet, and many excellent people are sadly perplexed about their duty in this matter; and whether they ought to give up animal food entirely. As I profess to make my book a manual for those who wish to preserve their health, as well as prepare their food in the most judicious manner, I will here give a brief sketch of the reasons which induce me to recommend a mixed diet, <emph rend="italic">bread, meat, vegetables and fruits, as the best, the only right regimen for the healthy.</emph></p>
<p size="smaller">It is an established truth in physiology, that man is omnivorous<ref target="n001">*</ref>--that is, constituted to eat almost every kind of food which, separately nourishes other animals. His teeth and stomach are formed to digest and masticate flesh, fish and all farinaceous and vegetable substances--he can eat and digest these even in a raw state, but it is necessary to perfect them for his nourishment in the most healthy manner, 
 
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=30"/>

that they be prepared by cooking--that is, softened by the use of fire and water.</p>
<ednote>The following footnote appears on the bottom of page 9 in the original text.</ednote>
<p size="smaller" id="n001">Some determined advocates of the vegetable system maintain, that the teeth and stomach of the monkey corresponds, in structure very closely with that of man, yet it lives on fruits--therefore, if man followed nature he would live on fruits and vegetables. But though the anatomical likeness between man and monkeys is striking, yet it is not complete; the difference may be and doubtless is precisely that which makes a difference of diet necessary to nourish and develop their dissimilar natures. Those who should live as the monkeys do would most closely resemble them.</p>
<p>Such is the evidence of nature to the suitableness of a mixed diet for the human race. The appointments of the Creator correspond with the structure of man. At the first, indeed, he was limited; "Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat," was the language of God to Adam.</p>
<p>There is no intimation that any other diet was in use for nearly seventeen hundred years. But this vegetable food did not nourish and develop the human faculties. The physical propensities must have had an almost overwhelming dominion, and if the intellectual powers were developed, they must have been made subservient to the basest animal passions, for the whole earth was filled with violence and men were utterly corrupt and wicked. The moral sentiments seem scarcely to have been felt or cultivated at all. And does not the same character, that is, the predominance of the physical over the intellectual and moral, mark even now in a considerable degree, every nation where, either from climate, custom or condition, the mass of the people are compelled to subsist chiefly on vegetable food?</p>
<p>When, after the destruction of the old world, Noah and his family came forth from the ark, and God assured him that, while the earth continued, the race should not be again plunged in such utter ruin, what new agent of human improvement and civilization was brought to the aid of mankind? We are told of none excepting a change in their diet;--the permission or command rather, to Noah to use animal food. "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."</p>
<p>Such was the Creator's arrangement, when he had determined that the character and condition of his rational creatures should go on improving, till the whole earth should be peopled and all be filled with the knowledge of the Lord.</p>
 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=31"/>

<p>And here we may remark, that the tribe or nation, who violates the express command of God, to separate the flesh from the blood and not to use the latter, and eats raw meat, never improves in character or condition. In truth, the command includes the rudiments of cookery, the preparation of food by the aid of fire; and till this is the constant habit of the community, men are savages.</p>
<p>If it be asked why, when flesh as a part of man's diet was so necessary to his well-being, was it not appointed him at the beginning?--Solve me this question--Why was the earth a progressive creation, which, as the researches of philosophers have conclusively proved, required thousands of ages to bring to its present state of mineral, vegetable and animal perfection? The same answer is true for both--it was the purpose of God to show forth his power, wisdom and goodness in a progressive rather than an instantaneous perfecting of his works.</p>
<p>In this respect man is in harmony with the sphere he inhabits.</p>
<p>But one thing is certain; since the appointment of flesh as a part of man's diet, no instance is recorded of its having been prohibited by divine authority. Intoxicating drinks have been forbidden to certain individuals; but from the time of righteous Abraham, who dressed a calf the better to entertain his angel visitors, till the coming of John, "whose meat was locusts and wild honey," no servant of God has been confined to a vegetable diet. The prophet who was fed by his express command, had "bread and flesh" twice each day.</p>
<p>In strict accordance with this theory, which makes a portion of animal food necessary to develop and sustain the human constitution, in its most perfect state of physical, intellectual and moral strength and beauty, we know that now in every country, where a mixed diet is habitually used, as in the temperate climates, there the greatest improvement of the race is to be found; and the greatest energy of character. It is that portion of the human family, who have the means of obtaining this food at least once a day, who now hold dominion over the earth. Seventy thousand of the beef-fed British govern and control ninety millions of the rice eating natives of India.</p>
 
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=32"/>

<p>In every nation on earth the <emph rend="italic">rulers,</emph> the men of power whether princes or priests, almost invariably use a portion of animal food. The people are often compelled, either from poverty or policy, to abstain.--Whenever the time shall arrive, that every <emph rend="italic">peasant</emph> in Europe is able to "put his pullet in the pot," even of a Sunday, a great improvement will have taken place in his character and condition; when he can have a portion of animal food, properly cooked, once each day, he will soon become a <emph rend="italic">man.</emph></p>
<p>In our own country, the beneficial effect of a generous diet, in developing and sustaining the energies of a whole nation is clearly evident. The severe and unremitting labors of every kind, which were requisite to subdue and obtain dominion of a wilderness world, could not have been done by a half starved, suffering people. A larger quantity and better quality of food were necessary here than would have supplied men in the old countries, where less action of body and mind are permitted.</p>
<p>Still, there is great danger of excess in all indulgences of the appetites, and even when a present benefit may be obtained, this danger should never be forgotten. The tendency in our country has been to excess in animal food. The advocates of the vegetable diet system had good cause for denouncing this excess, and the indiscriminate use of flesh. It was, and now is, frequently given to young children--infants, before they have teeth, which is a sin against nature, which often costs the life of the poor little sufferer--it is eaten two freely by the sedentary and delicate: and to make it worse still, it is eaten, often in a half-cooked state, and swallowed without sufficient chewing. All these things are wrong and ought to be reformed.</p>
<p>I hope "The Good Housekeeper" will do something towards enlightening public opinion on the proper kinds of food and the proper manner of preparing it. These subjects have never been sufficiently considered. Many, probably most, of the receipts now in use, have been the result of chance or the whim of a depraved appetite. But as the spirit of enquiry is abroad, searching out abuses of all kinds, let us hope that the abuses of the good things God has so bounteously given us will not be suffered to go unreproved.</p>

<p>When women are thoroughly instructed in physiology, and the natural laws which govern the human constitution, in chemistry and in domestic economy, then we may expect that desideratum of Doctor Johnson--a cookery book on philosophical principles.</p>
<p>And now we will return to the subject of <emph rend="italic">bread</emph>, and describe minutely the best practical manner of preparation at present understood.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">FLOUR.</hd>
<p>The first requisite for <emph rend="italic">good bread</emph> is that the flour or meal be good. Wheat is always better for being washed; if it be at all injured by smut, it is not fit for food unless it be thoroughly washed. In the country this is easily done.</p>
<p>Put the grain in a clean tub, a bushel at a time; fill the tub with water, and stir the whole up from the bottom, briskly, with your hand, or a stick. Pour off the water and fill it with clean till the water ceases to be colored or dirty. Two or three waters usually are sufficient. Finish the washing quickly as possible, so as not to soak the grain; then spread it thinly on a large, strong sheet, (it is best to keep a coarse unbleached sheet solely for this purpose, if you wash your grain,) laid on clean boards in the sun, or where the sun and air can be freely admitted. Stir the grain with your hand every two or three hours,--it will dry in a day, if the weather be fair.</p>
<p>Fresh ground flour makes the best and sweetest bread. If you live in the vicinity of a mill, never have more than one or two bushels ground into flour at a time.</p>
<p>A bushel of good, clear wheat will make fiftysix pounds of flour, besides the bran and middlings.</p>
<p>If you purchase flour by the barrel or sack, be careful to ascertain that it is good and pure. In Europe flour is often adulterated, that is, mixed with other substances, to swell its bulk and weight. <emph rend="italic">Whiting, ground stones and bones, and plaster of Paris,</emph> are the ingredients chiefly used. To be sure, none of these things are absolutely poisonous, but they are injurious, and no one wants them in bread. In our country we think such deceptions are seldom attempted, still it may be well to know how to detect the least bad matter in flour.</p>
 
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=34"/>

<p>To discover <emph rend="italic">whiting,</emph> dip the ends of the fore-finger and thumb into sweet oil, and take up a small quantity of flour between them. If it be pure, you may freely rub the fingers together for any length of time, it will not become sticky, and the substance will turn nearly black; if whiting be mixed with the flour, a few times rubbing turns it into putty, but its color is very little changed.</p>
<p>To detect stone-dust or plaster of Paris; drop the juce of lemon or a little sharp vinegar on a small quantity of flour; if adulterated, an immediate commotion or effervescence takes place; if pure, it will remain at rest. Another quick, easy and pretty sure method of trial is to take a handful of flour and squeeze it very tightly for a minute--if it be good and pure, when you open your hand, the flour will remain in a lump, in the form you have given it, even the grains and wrinkles of the skin of the hand will be visible--you may place it on the table without breaking--but if it contains foreign substances, it will not adhere thus, but crumble and fall almost immediately.</p>
<p>Sour or musty flour may be easily known by the smell. Such damaged stuff can never make good, healthy bread, though public bakers, it is said, often prefer to use it, because it is cheapest, and they know methods of preparation by which they can produce light and white bread from this damaged flour. The bread is, to be sure, nearly tasteless, and it cannot be equally nourishing as good flour would make; but if it looks well, it will <emph rend="italic">sell.</emph> Those who bake their own bread have the opportunity of knowing that it is made of good ingredients; and if they make it after the following recipe, they may be sure of good bread.</p>

<hd align="center">MAKING BREAD.</hd>
<p>A large family will, probably, use a bushel of flour weekly; but we will take the proper quantity for a family of four or five persons.</p>
<p>Take <emph rend="italic">twentyone quarts</emph> of flour, put it into a <implement>kneading trough</implement> or <implement>earthen pan</implement> which is well glazed, and large enough to hold double the quantity of flour. Make a deep, round hole in the centre of the flour, and pour into it <emph rend="italic">half a pint</emph> of brewer's yeast, or the thick sediment from home-brewed beer--the last if good, is to be preferred. In either 
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=35"/>

case the yeast must be mixed with a pint of milk-warm water, and well stirred before it is poured in. Then with a spoon stir into this liquid, gradually, so much of the surrounding flour as will make it like thin batter; sprinkle this over with dry flour, till it is covered entirely. Then cover the trough or pan with a warm cloth, and set it by the fire in winter, and where the sun is shining in summer. This process is called "setting the sponge." The object is to give strength and character to the ferment by communicating the quality of <emph rend="italic">leaven</emph> to a small portion of the flour; which will then be easily extended to the whole. <emph rend="italic">Setting sponge</emph> is a measure of wise precaution--for if the yeast does not rise and ferment in the middle of the flour it shows that the yeast is not good; the batter can then be removed, without wasting much of the flour, and another sponge set with better yeast.</p>
<p>Let the sponge stand till the batter has swelled and risen so as to form cracks in the covering of flour; then scatter over it two table spoonfuls of fine salt, and begin to form the mass into dough by pouring in, by degrees, as much warm water as is necessary to mix with the flour. <emph rend="italic">Twenty-one quarts of flour</emph> will require about <emph rend="italic">four quarts of water.</emph> It will be well to prepare rather more; soft water is much the best; it should in summer be warm as new milk; during winter, it ought to be somewhat warmer, as flour is a cold, heavy substance.</p>
<p>Add the water by degrees to the flour, mix them with your hand, till the whole mass is incorporated; it must then be worked most thoroughly, moulded over and over and kneaded with your clenched hands, till it becomes so perfectly smooth and light as well as stiff, that not a particle will adhere to your hands. Remember that you cannot have good bread, light and white, unless you give the dough a thorough kneading.--Then make the dough into a lump in the middle of the trough or pan, and dust it over with flour to prevent its adhering to the vessel. Cover it with a warm cloth, and in the winter the vessel should be placed near the fire. It now undergoes a further fermentation, which is shown by its swelling and rising; this, if the ferment was well formed, will be at its height in an 
 
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=36"/>

hour--somewhat less in very warm weather. It ought to be taken at its height, before it begins to fall.<ref target="n002">*</ref></p>
<p>Divide the dough into seven equal portions; mould on your <implement>paste-board,</implement> and form them into loaves; put these on well floured tin or earthen plates, and place immediately in the oven.</p>
<p>The oven, if a good one and you have good dry wood, will heat sufficiently in an hour. It is best to kindle the fire in it with dry pine, hemlock furze or some quick burning material; then fill it up with faggots or hard wood split fine and dried, sufficient to heat it--let the wood burn down and stir the coals evenly over the bottom of the oven, let them lie till they are like embers; the bricks at the arch and sides will be clear from any color of smoke when the oven is sufficiently hot. Clean and sweep the oven,--throw in a little flour on the bottom,--if it burns black at once, do not put in the bread, but let it stand a few moments and cool.</p>
<p>It is a good rule to put the fire in the oven when the dough is made up--the batter will rise and the former heat in about the same time.</p>
<p>When the loaves are in the oven, it must be closed and kept tight, except you open it for a moment to see how the bread appears. If the oven is properly heated, loaves of the size named, will be done in an hour and a half or two hours. They will weigh four pounds per loaf, or about that--thus giving you twentyeight pounds of bread from twentyone quarts (or pounds) of flour. The weight gained is from the water.</p>
<p>It is the best economy to calculate (or ascertain by experiment) the number of loaves of a certain weight or size, necessary for a week's consumption in your family, and bake accordingly. In the winter season bread may be kept good for a fortnight; still I think it the best rule to bake once every week. Bread should not be eaten at all till it 
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=37"/>

has been baked, at least, one day. When the loaves are done, take them from the oven, and place them on a clean shelf, in a clean, cool pantry. If the crust happen to be scorched, or the bread is too much baked, the loaves, when they are taken out of the oven, may be wrapped in a clean, coarse towel, which has been slightly damped. It is well to keep a light cloth thrown over all the loaves. When a loaf has been cut, it should be kept in a tight box from the air, if you wish to prevent its drying.</p>
<ednote>The Following Footnote appears in the Original Text at the End of Page 16.</ednote>
<p id="n002" size="smaller">*There are three processes in fermentation--the <emph rend="italic">vinous,</emph> which makes the dough light and white--the <emph rend="italic">acetous,</emph> which turns it sour and rather brown--and the putrefactive, which utterly spoils it.--The only <emph rend="italic">good bread</emph> is made by baking the dough when the <emph rend="italic">vinuous</emph> fermentation is exactly at its height. As soon as the acetous commences, the dough is injured. It it may be in a measure restored by mixing diluted pearlash or sal&#230;ratus, and working it thoroughly with every portion of the dough--then baking it quickly.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">BROWN OR DYSPEPSIA BREAD.</purpose>

This bread is now best known as "Graham bread"--not that Doctor Graham invented or discovered the manner of its preparation, but that he has been unwearied and successful in recommending it to the public. It is an excellent article of diet for the dyspeptic and the costive; and for most persons of sedentary habits, would be beneficial. It agrees well with children; and, in short, I think it should be used in every family, though not to the exclusion of fine bread. The most difficult point in manufacturing this bread, is to obtain good pure meal. It is said that much of the bread commonly sold as <emph rend="italic">dyspepsia,</emph> is made of the <emph rend="italic">bran</emph> or <emph rend="italic">middlings,</emph> from which the fine flour has been separated; and that <emph rend="italic">saw-dust</emph> is sometimes mixed with the meal. To be certain that it is good, send good, clean wheat to the <implement>mill,</implement> have it ground rather coarsely, and keep the meal in a dry, cool place. Before using it, sift it through a common <implement>hair sieve;</implement> this will separate the very coarse and harsh particles.</p>
<p>Take six quarts of this <ingredient>wheat meal,</ingredient> one <implement>tea-cup</implement> of good <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and half a <implement>tea-cup</implement> of <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> mix these with a pint of <ingredient>milk-warm water</ingredient> and a tea-spoonful of <ingredient>pearlash</ingredient> or <ingredient>sal&#230;ratus.</ingredient> Make a hole in the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and stir this mixture in the middle of the meal till it is like batter. Then proceed as with fine flour bread. Make the dough when sufficiently light into four loaves, which will weigh two pounds per loaf when baked. It requires a hotter oven than fine flour bread and must bake about an hour and a half.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">RYE AND INDIAN BREAD.</purpose>

This is a sweet and nourishing diet, and generally acceptable to children.</p>
<p>It is economical, and when wheat is scarce, is a pretty good substitute for dyspepsia bread.</p>
<p>There are many different proportions of mixing it--some put one third <ingredient>indian meal</ingredient> with two of <ingredient>rye;</ingredient> others like one third <ingredient>rye</ingredient> and two of <ingredient>indian;</ingredient> others prefer it half and half.</p>
<p>If you use the largest proportion of <ingredient>rye meal,</ingredient> make your dough stiff, so that it will mould into loaves;--when it is two thirds <ingredient>indian,</ingredient> it should be softer and baked in deep earthen or tin pans after the following rules.</p>
<p>Take <emph rend="italic">four quarts</emph> of sifted <ingredient>indian meal;</ingredient> put it into a glazed earthen pan, sprinkle over it a table-spoonful of <ingredient>fine salt;</ingredient> pour over it about two quarts of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> stir and work it till every part of the meal is thoroughly wet; <ingredient>indian</ingredient> absorbs a greater quantity of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> When it is about milk warm, work in <emph rend="italic">two quarts of <ingredient>rye meal,</ingredient> half a pint</emph> of <ingredient>lively yeast,</ingredient> mixed with a pint of <ingredient>warm water;</ingredient> add more <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> if needed. Work the mixture well with your hands; it should be stiff, but not firm as <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dough. Have ready a large, deep, well buttered pan; put in the dough, and smooth the top by putting your hand in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and then patting down the loaf. Set this to rise in a warm place in the winter; in the summer it should not be put by the fire. When it begins to crack on the top, which will usually be in about an hour or an hour and a half, put it into a well-heated oven, and bake it three or four hours. It is better to let it stand in the oven all night, unless the weather is warm. <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> requires to be well cooked. The loaf will weigh between seven and eight pounds. Pan bread keeps best in large loaves.</p>
<p>Many use <ingredient>milk</ingredient> in mixing bread;--in the country where <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is plentiful, it is a good practice, as bread is certainly richer wet with <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> than with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> but it will not keep so long in warm weather.</p>
<p>Baking can very well be done in a stove; during the winter this is an economical way of cooking--but the stove

Set it in a cool place in summer and a warm one in winter. When it becomes perfectly light, it is fit for use. If not needed immediately, it should, when it becomes cold, be put in a clean jug or bottle; do not fill the vessel and the cork must be left loose till the next morning, when the yeast will have done working.

<p>If you wish to economize in family expenses, bake your own bread. If this is <emph rend="italic">good,</emph> it will be better as well as healthier than baker's bread. If you use a stove, you can bake during the winter with very little expense of fuel; and the flour to make bread for a family will cost about one third less than the bread.

<p>The rich will find several advantages in having a portion, at least, of their bread baked at home, even though the saving of money should not be an object. They can be <emph rend="italic">certain</emph> that their bread is made of good flour. This is not always sure when eating baker's bread. Much damaged flour, sour, musty, or grown,<ref target="n003">*</ref> is often used by the public bakers, particularly in scarce or bad seasons. The skill of the baker and the use of certain ingredients--(alum, ammonia, sulphate of zinc, and even sulphate of copper, it is said, has been used!)--will make this flour into light, white bread. But it is nearly tasteless, and cannot be as healthy or nutritious as bread made from the flour of good, sound wheat, baked at home, without any mixture of drugs and correctives. Even the best of baker's bread is comparatively tasteless, and must be eaten when new to be relished. But good home-baked bread will keep a week, and is better on that account for the health.</p>
<p>Those who live in the country, bake their own bread, of course; and there every lady, old and young, must be, more or less, familiar with the process. But in our cities, ladies marry and commence housekeeping, without knowing anything of bread making. Yet there is not one individual, not even the wealthiest, but is liable to be placed in circumstances where the comfort and health of her husband and children may depend in a great measure, on her own knowledge of this important culinary art.</p>
<p>She may be settled where it is impossible to obtain help, or such as understand their duties; her skill and judgment, if not her hands, must supply the deficiency. If she cannot do this, she will, if she be a sensible and conscientious woman, feel, with Miss Sedgwick's heroine, in "Means and Ends," that Italian and music are worthless accomplishments compared with the knowledge of bread-making.</p>
<p>Indeed, this knowledge ought to be considered an accomplishment; and, like cake-making, the province of the mistress of the house and her daughters. <emph rend="italic">Then</emph> the hard, heavy, sour, crude stuff, now often found under the name 
 
<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=42"/>

of "family bread," would not be tolerated. Ladies would be as particular in this respect as in the quality of their cakes.</p>
<ednote>the Following Footnote Originally appeared at the End of Page 21 in the Book.</ednote>
<p id="n003" size="smaller">*When the harvest season is very wet, and the wheat cannot be gathered and dried when it is ripe, it often swells in the ear; and this is called <emph rend="italic">grown grain.</emph> It is very difficult to make light bread from the flour of such grain.</p>
<p>Is it not a thousand times more important that the bread, necessary to the health and comfort of those we love, and which is required at every meal, should be made in the best manner (remember it is a saving of expense to make bread well) than that the cake, made for "the dear five hundred friends," who attend a fashionable party for their own amusement, sometimes found in ridiculing the hostess, should be "superb?"</p>
<p>It would not require a very great sacrifice of time to attend, once each week, to this department of "household good." If the <emph rend="italic">sponge</emph> be set at seven or half past, in the morning, and every thing well managed, the bread will be ready to be drawn from the oven by twelve. Four or five hours of attention, then, is required; but three fourths of this time might be employed in needlework, or other pursuits. Only half or three quarters of an hour, devoted to kneading the bread, is wanted in active exertion; and this would be one of the most beneficial exercises our young ladies could practise.</p>
<p>The exercise of the hands and arms, in such a way as to strengthen all the muscles of the body, is very seldom practised by ladies; and hence much of the debility and languor they undergo. Many kinds of household labour are unpleasant, because they soil the clothes, or render the hands dark, rough and hard. But bread-making (not the heating and cleaning of the oven,) is as neat as cake-making; and kneading the dough will make the fairest hand fairer and softer, the exercise giving that healthy pink glow to the palm and nails which is so beautiful.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at length on this subject, because I consider it as important as did "Uncle John," that "Girls should learn to make bread--the staff of life"--and that to do this well is an accomplishment which the lovely and talented should consider indispensable, one of the "<emph rend="italic">must haves</emph>" of female education.</p>
<p>There are three things which must be exactly <emph rend="italic">right,</emph> in order to have good bread--the quality of the <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> the lightness or fermentation of the dough; and the heat of the oven. No precise rules can be given to ascertain these 
 
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=43"/>

points. It requires observation, reflection, and a quick, nice judgement to decide when all are right. Thus, you see, that bread-making is not a mere mechanical treadmill operation, like many household concerns; but a work of mind; the woman who always has good home-baked bread on the table shows herself to have good sense and good management.</p>

<p>Effect of animal food--Proper manner of using it--Different kinds of meat--Comparative economy of different modes of cooking--Beef--Pork--Mutton--Lamb--Veal--Venison--Fowls--Birds--Preserving meats.</p>
<p>PHYSICAL health, vigor of mind, and comfort of bodily feeling, depend in a very great degree, on the manner in which animal food is used. To secure the greatest amount of benefit from this costly<ref target="n004">*</ref> article of diet, which God has appointed for the sustenance, in part, of his rational creatures, three conditions seem indispensable--it must be prepared in a proper way; taken at proper times; and in proper quantities.</p>
<p>The proper manner of preparation is, to cook it till it is entirely <emph rend="italic">separated from the blood,</emph> and the fibres are rendered soft and easy of digestion.</p>
<p>The proper times of taking meat may be best told by negatives--it is not proper to give it to infants under three years of age; nor should it then be freely given. After the infantile diseases are mostly over, and exercise in the open air is daily practised, the child may be permitted to eat a portion of animal food with its dinner; but not till youth enters on the real labors of life, study, 
 
<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=44"/>

business or work, in good earnest, should a full portion be allowed.</p>
<ednote>The Following Text Originally appeared at the End of Page 23.</ednote>
<p id="n004" size="smaller"> *The cost of <emph rend="italic">life.</emph></p>
<p>Animal food should never be given to the sick, when any symptoms of excited action in the system from fever are apparent. It should not be taken in large meals by the sedentary, the idle, or the delicate; nor by any person immediately before retiring to rest at night.</p>
<p>There is much more danger of excess in using animal than vegetable food. The reason is, that meats can be cooked in a greater variety of ways, are more condensed by cooking and made so "savory" by seasoning, &amp;c. that the taste is tempted when the appetite is satisfied. Not so with plain bread; let it be made in the best possible manner, still we seem to decide, as if by instinct, the exact point when we have had enough.</p>
<p>But meats tax the reasoning powers, observation and reflection, to decide when the proper quantity has been taken. Thus to understand rightly the nature and regulate the conditions of using animal food is an intellectual process, of a much higher kind than is required for the arrangement of a vegetable diet. It is rational then to suppose that animal food strengthens the reasoning powers, or the brain, the organ of the mind, better than vegetable food could do.</p>
<p>Let no one suppose from this, that the more meat he eats the wiser he will grow. It is using animal food <emph rend="italic">rightly,</emph> not in gross quantities, which shows that our reason is strengthening. Remember, too, that</p>
<p align="center" size="smaller">"Good things spoiled corrupt to worst."</p>
<p>Oxygen is necessary to support life, but we could not live in an atmosphere of oxygen. The Creator has himself mingled the right proportions of the different gases, which form vital air for the lungs. He has left to our discretion the preparation of food for the stomach, only designating the several kinds of aliment. It would be about as rational to covet pure oxygen to breathe, as to argue that living wholly on animal food would be best, because a portion of it is advantageous.</p>
<p>The quantity of animal food required to sustain the constitution in its most perfect state, is greatest in the coldest countries, and, decreasing according to the warmth of the 
 
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=45"/>

climate, when we reach the torrid zone, but a small quantity is needed. In temperate climates, like our own, the largest quantity is required during the winter. None should use it freely during the hottest weather, except it be those who labor hard in the open air; it rarely appears to injure such, yet probably it would be best for them to eat less meat and more bread and vegetables during summer. They would not then suffer so much from thirst, which usually induces the desire for stimulating liquids.</p>
<p>As a general rule, animal food is more easily and speedily digested than vegetable food of any kind--and this it is which makes meats more heating and stimulating. The great essentials for the easy digestion of animal food are that the fibres be tender and fine grained.</p>
<p>Of the different sorts of butcher meat, <emph rend="italic">Pork</emph> is that of which the least quantity should be taken at a time. It requires longer to digest roasted pork than any other kind of meat.</p>
<p>Beef agrees well with most constitutions; it is cheapest in the autumn, but best in the winter season. Many have a distaste to mutton; but for those who relish it, it is a nutritious food and easy of digestion.</p>
<p>Lamb, veal, and fowls are delicate and healthy diet for the young and sedentary; and for all who find fat meats and those of coarse fibre do not agree with them.</p>
<p>The most economical way of cooking meat is to <emph rend="italic">boil</emph> it, if the liquid be used for soup or broth, as it always ought to be.</p>
<p>Baking is one of the cheapest ways of dressing a dinner in small families, and several kinds of meat are excellent done in this way. Legs and loins of pork, legs of mutton and fillets of veal will bake to much advantage; especially if they be fat. Never bake a lean, thin piece, it will all shrivel away.--Such pieces should always be boiled or made into soup.--Pigs, geese and the buttock of beef are all excellent baked. Meat always loses in weight by being cooked.--In roasting the loss is greatest. It also costs more in fuel to roast than to boil--still there are many pieces of meat which seem made for roasting; and it would be almost wrong to cook them in any other way. Those who 
 
<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=46"/>

cannot afford to roast their meat, should not purchase the sirloin of beef.</p>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">BEEF.</hd>
<hd align="center">DIRECTIONS FOR CHOOSING AND COOKING.</hd>
<p>Ox beef is considered the best; heifer beef is excellent where well fed, and is most suitable for small families. If you want the best, choose that which has a fine smooth grain--the lean of a bright red; the fat white or nearly so.</p>
<p>The best roasting piece is the sirloin; then the first three ribs; if kept till they are quite tender, and boned, they are nearly equal to the sirloin, and better for a family dinner.</p>
<p>The round is used for <emph rend="italic">alamode</emph> beef and is the best piece for corning.</p>
<p>The best beef steak is cut from the inner part of the sirloin. Good steak may be cut from the ribs.</p>
<p>If you wish to practise economy buy the chuck, or piece between the shoulder and the neck; it makes a good roast or steak, and is excellent for stewing or baking. The thick part of the flank is also a profitable piece; good to bake or boil, or even roast.</p>
<p>The leg and shin of beef make the best soup--the heart is profitable meat, and good broiled or roasted. The leg rund is used for mince pies--it needs to be boiled till it is very tender. The tongue when fresh is a rich part for mince pies. If eaten by itself, it should be pickled and smoked.</p>
<p>The other pieces of the animal are best salted and boiled; or if used fresh, stewed or in soups. Beef should rarely be fried.</p>
<p>Fresh beef is better for being kept three or four days in moderate, and much longer in cold weather. One reason why beef is not so good or wholesome in summer is, that it must be eaten too fresh, and while the fibre is tough, or it will spoil. Do not attempt to keep it longer than till the second day in hot weather. In the winter, if frozen, and packed in snow, it may be kept many days, even weeks. To thaw frozen meat always lay it in cold water; and allow one third longer time to cook meat in the winter, especially if it has been frozen, than would be required in warm weather.</p>
 
<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=47"/>

<p>When beef is to be kept for any length of time it should be carefully wiped every day. In warm weather, it is well to sprinkle it over with pepper to keep it from the flies. Should it become in the least tainted, wash it in cold water, then in strong chamomile tea, afterwards sprinkle it with salt, if it is not to be used till the following day. It must be again thoroughly washed in cold water, before it is cooked. Roughly pounded charcoal rubbed all over the meat will remove the taint.</p>
<p>These directions equally apply to all sorts of meat.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO ROAST BEEF.</purpose>

The <ingredient>sirloin</ingredient> is too large for a private family; one weighing fifteen pounds is the best size for roasting; but this may be divided if a small one is required. It should be washed in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> then dried with a clean cloth and rubbed over with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> covered with a piece of white paper tied on with thread. The spit should be clean as sand and water can make it. Be sure and wipe it dry immediately after it is drawn from the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and scour and wash it always before using.</p>
<p>The fire must be bright and clear, but not scorching when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is put down. Place it about ten inches from the fire at first and gradually move it nearer. It should be basted with a little clean dripping or <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> put into the <implement>roaster</implement> or <implement>tin-kitchen,</implement> as soon as it is down. Be sure this <implement>roaster</implement> is perfectly clean. Continue to baste the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> at intervals, and turn the spit frequently, and when the roast is nearly done--or about half an hour before you take it up--remove the paper from the fat, sprinkle on a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and baste it well--then pour off the top of the dripping, which is nearly all liquid fat, and would prove unhealthy if used in the gravy; then take a <implement>tea-cup</implement> of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> into which put a salt-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and drop this by degrees, on the brown parts of the joints (the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will soon brown again.)--Stir the fire and make it clear; sprinkle a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over the roast, baste it with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and dredge it with <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--very soon the froth will rise; then it must be taken up directly and dished.--Pour the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> from the <implement>roaster,</implement> skim it, and give it a boil, then send it to table in a boat.

Instead of hanging the <implement>boiler</implement> low, it seems the ambition of the housewife to elevate it as near the stars as possible.

<hd align="center">PORK.</hd>
<p>Pork that is fed from the dairy, and fattened on corn is the best--potatoes do very well for part of the feeding. But pork fattened from the still-house is all but poisonous; it should never be eaten by christians or those who wish to preserve their health.</p>
<p>The offals, &amp;c., with which pork in the vicinity of a city is fattened, make it unsavory and unwholesome. Such stuff should be used for manure, and never given as food to animals whose flesh is to be eaten by man!</p>
<p>When pork is good, the flesh looks very white and smooth and the fat white and fine. Hogs two years old make the best--older than that, their flesh is apt to be rank. Measly pork is very unwholesome, and never should be eaten. It may be known, as the fat is filled with small kernels.</p>
<p>When the rind is thick and tough, and cannot easily be impressed with the finger, the pork is old, and will require more cooking.</p>
<p>If pork is not cooked enough it is disagreeable and almost indigestible; it should never be eaten unless it is thoroughly done.</p>
<p>The fat parts of pork are not very healthy food. Those who labor hard may feel no inconvenience from this diet; but children should never eat it; nor is it healthy for the delicate and sedentary. Fat pork seems more proper as material for frying fish and other meats, and as a garnish, than to be cooked and eaten by itself. It is best and least apt to prove injurious during the cold weather.</p>

<p>The lean, especially the ham, is excellent; and when eaten moderately seldom proves injurious; but a full meal of roast pork or pig is a hazardous experiment. Unless the stomach be very strong, it will cause heaviness and nausea.</p>
<p>In short, there is no doubt that pork is the kind of meat which should be most sparingly used in substance. As an auxiliary in the culinary department, we could not comfortably dispense with it.</p>

Take a <ingredient>leg of pork,</ingredient> one weighing eight pounds will require full three and a half hours to roast it. Wash it clean, and dry it with a cloth; with a sharp knife score the skin in diamonds about an inch square.</p>
<p>Make a stuffing with <ingredient>grated bread,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and two small <ingredient>onions</ingredient> chopped fine, seasoned with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and moistened with the <ingredient>yolk of an egg.</ingredient> Put this in under the skin of the knuckle, and in deep incisions made in the thick part of the <ingredient>leg;</ingredient> rub a little <ingredient>fine powdered sage</ingredient> into the skin where it is scored; and then, with a <implement>paste brush</implement> or goose feather, rub the whole surface of the skin with <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> this makes the crackling crisper and browner than basting it with dripping, it will be perfect in color, and the skin will not blister.</p>
<p>Do not put it too near the fire; and it must be moistened at intervals with <ingredient>sweet oil</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> tied up in a rag. When it is done, skim the fat from the <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> which may be thickened with a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> rolled in <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Apple-sauce</ingredient> is always proper to accompany roasted pork--this, with <ingredient>potatoes, mashed or plain,</ingredient> <ingredient>mashed turnips,</ingredient> and <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> are good.</p>

Takes more time than any other meat. If you buy your pork ready salted, ask how many days it has been in salt; if many, it will require to be soaked in <ingredient>water</ingredient> for six hours before you dress it. When you cook it, wash and scrape it as clean as possible; when delicately dressed, it is a favorite dish with almost everybody. Take care it does not boil fast; if it does, the knuckle will break to pieces, before the thick part of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is warm through; a <ingredient>leg</ingredient> of seven pounds takes three hours and a half very slow simmering. Skim your pot very carefully, and when you take the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> out of the <implement>boiler,</implement> scrape it clean.</p>
<p>The proper vegetables are <ingredient>parsnips,</ingredient> <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> or <ingredient>carrots.</ingredient> Some like <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> but it is a strong, rank vegetable, and does not agree with a delicate stomach.

<hd align="center">MUTTON.</hd>
<p>Mutton is best from August till January. It is nutritious and often agrees better than any other meat with weak stomachs. To have it tender, it must be kept as long as possible without injury. Be sure and cook it till it is <emph rend="italic">done;</emph> the gravy that runs when the meat is cut should <emph rend="italic">never show the least tinge of blood.</emph> It is an abomination to serve it, as some do, half raw.</p>
<p>To roast mutton, make a brisk fire, and allow fifteen or twenty minutes to the pound. Paper the fat parts. Baste and froth it, the same as beef.</p>
<p>The hind quarter or haunch is the prime piece to roast--the leg, loin, neck and breast may all be cooked in this manner--though it is more profitable to boil the leg. The following is a good receipt.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">A Stuffed Loin of Mutton.</emph> Take the skin off a loin of mutton with the flap on; bone it neatly; make a nice veal stuffing and fill the inside of the loin with it where the bones were removed; roll it up tight, <implement>skewer</implement> the flap, and tie twine round it to keep it firmly together; put the outside skin over it till nearly roasted, and then remove it that the mutton may brown. Serve with a nice gravy, mashed turnips and potatoes. Currant jelly is eaten with mutton.</p>
<p>Mutton must be boiled the same as other meats--that is, <emph rend="italic">simmered very slowly,</emph> and the scum carefully removed. Always wash it before cooking and put it in cold water. Only allow water sufficient to cover it, and the liquor makes excellent broth, with a little rice and a few carrots, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mutton for boiling must not be kept so long as it may be for roasting. Two or three days is sufficient; in warm weather less.</p>

<p>The <emph rend="italic">loin</emph> is the best part of a calf, and requires to be roasted about three hours.

<p>The fillet is good stewed like a shoulder of mutton.</p>
<p>The neck of veal makes fine cutlets--season and fry or broil like mutton chops.</p>
<p>Veal is a delicate meat, but not easy of digestion unless it be done very tender. Broiled, it is most difficult to digest. When boiled, stewed or made into soup it must be very carefully skimmed, as it sends up a great quantity of scum and is easily discolored.</p>
<p>The knuckle is best stewed as the whimsical receipt of Gay, the poet, testifies.</p>

<p>No kind of animal food is so delicate and delicious as the flesh of fowls and birds, and no kind is so generally healthful. Rarely does it disagree with those who are well; even the feeble in constitution, or those debilitated by sickness, find this a most agreeable and nutritious diet.</p>
<p>The white meat of a young turkey, when well boiled, is easier of digestion than that of any other fowl.</p>
<p>In a young turkey, the toes and bill are soft.</p>
<p>A young goose (a very old one is not fit to be eaten) is plump in the breast, and the fat white and soft--the feet yellow, the web of the foot</p>
<p>Ducks, if young, feel very tender under the wing, and the web of the foot is transparent.</p>
<p>The best fowls have yellow legs--if very old, the feet look stiff and worn.</p>
<p>Pigeons should be quite fresh, the breast plump and fat.</p>
<p>Poultry should lie one night after being killed in warm weather to make it tender; in cold weather it may be kept a much longer time to advantage.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">PIGEONS.</purpose>

About the only birds in New England worth cooking, are the pigeon and partridge. A few quails and woodcocks are occasionally found; the robin is sometimes killed; but it is a sin against feeling to destroy a singing bird--one, too, so innocent and gentle. Any one who kills a robin to eat, ought to have it hung round his neck as the albatross was around the "Ancient Mariner."</p>
<p>Pigeons are dry and easily digested food, but not quite so delicate as partridges. For the sick, the latter are very appropriate, and may be eaten, if good, (they are sometimes almost poisonous, in the early spring, supposed to be caused by feeding on a certain berry,) when other meats would be injurious.</p>
<p><ingredient>Pigeons</ingredient> may be broiled like chickens, or roasted, only tying over the breast thin slices of <ingredient>fat bacon.</ingredient> When the bird is nearly done, then remove the bacon; dredge with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> baste with a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>froth.</ingredient> They will roast in about half an hour. They may be stuffed or not, as you like. Make a <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> with the <ingredient>giblets,</ingredient> mixed with <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> seasoned with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and thickened with a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></p>

<hd align="center">PRESERVING MEATS.</hd>
<p>Salt is the grand preservative of meats; but in using these, care should be taken to soak them if too salt. It is not healthy to eat our food very salt.</p>
<p>In the summer season particular attention must be observed, lest fresh meat be injured. In the country this care is very necessary.</p>
<p>Be sure and take the kernels out of a round of beef; one in the udder, in the fat, and those about the thick end of the flank.</p>
<p>To salt the meat thoroughly, rub in the salt evenly into every part, and fill the holes full where the kernels were taken out.</p>
<p>A pound and a half of salt will be sufficient for twenty-five pounds of beef, if you only want to corn it to be eaten in a few days.</p>
<p>In the summer, the sooner meat is salted, after it is cool, the better. In winter it is better to be kept a few days before salting.</p>
<p>Pork ought not to be allowed to freeze before it is salted for family use.</p>
<p>If you wish beef to look red, rub it first with saltpetre and sugar; half an ounce of each mixed together, is sufficient for twenty pounds of meat.</p>

The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> must be sprinkled with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and the next day wiped dry, before pouring the <ingredient>pickle</ingredient> over it, with which it should always be completely covered. You must add four ounces of <ingredient>saltpetre.</ingredient> The same <ingredient>pickle</ingredient> will do for <ingredient>tongues</ingredient> and <ingredient>hams.</ingredient></p>
<p>Canvas lids should be placed over salting tubs, to admit air and exclude flies, which are more destructive to salting meat than to fresh.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to secure bacon and hams from the fly. The best method is, to put them in coarse calico or canvas bags; paper is apt to break in damp weather. Always keep smoked meat in a dark place.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO SALT FAT PORK.</purpose>

Pack it down tightly in the barrel, each layer of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> covered with clean <ingredient>coarse salt;</ingredient> then make a strong <ingredient>brine</ingredient> with two gallons of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and as much <ingredient>coarse salt</ingredient> as will dissolve in it; boil and skim; let it stand till it is perfectly cold, and then pour it to the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> till that is covered. <ingredient>Pork</ingredient> is best without sugar or saltpetre, provided it be always kept covered with this strong <ingredient>brine.</ingredient></p>
<p>An excellent way to keep fresh meat during the winter, is practised by the farmers in the country, which they term "salting in snow." Take a large clean tub, cover the bottom three or four inches thick with clean snow; then lay in pieces of fresh meat, spare-ribs, fowls, or whatever you wish to keep, and cover each layer with two or three inches of snow, taking particular care to fill snow into every cranny and crevice between the pieces, and around the edges of the tub. Fowls must also be filled inside with the snow. When the tub is filled the last layer must be snow, pressed down tight; then cover the tub, which must be in a cold place, the colder the better. The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will not freeze, and unless there happen to be a long <emph rend="italic">spell</emph> of warm weather, the snow will not thaw; but the meat remain as fresh and juicy when it is taken out to be cooked, as when it was first killed.</p>

<p>Soups hurtful to Dyspeptics--suitable for the Healthy--Economic way of making Soups and Gravies--Turtle Soup--Currie--Veal--Beef or Mutton--White--Pigeon--Vegetable--Rice--Peas--For an Invalid--Gravies--Melted Butter.</p>
<p>ONE of the popular errors in regard to diet is considering soups and broths as light food, and therefore always proper for weak stomachs, and feeble constitutions.</p>
<p>"Oh, this nice broth cannot hurt you!"--"The hot soup must do you good this cold day," is often said to the poor shivering dyspeptic, or drooping invalid. And if they take this food and are injured by it--why their case must be desperate, indeed, not to bear a little soup!</p>
<p>In Dr Beaumont's experiments on the effect of the gastric fluid on the different kinds of food usually taken into the stomach, soups were found to be among the most indigestible; and the reason is, that the water in the soup must be separated from the nourishment before the process of digestion can begin. This separation takes some time; then if the stomach be weak or diseased, and secrete (or form) but little gastric juice, this becomes diluted and the action of the stomach materially deranged by the effort of separating the water from the nutritive particles in the soup. Dyspeptics, therefore, should not take this kind of food; nor any kind that is very liquid. Bilious persons, and those who are troubled with heart-burn and indigestion, would be injured by eating soups often. For children, if a good share of rice and other vegetables be in the liquid, or considerable bread eaten with it, soup is a generally healthy and invigorating food; and for those who are in health and labor hard, and require large meals, it is a good plan to begin the dinner with soup of some kind, as otherwise they would be inclined to take too much solid food.</p>
<p>With these restrictions, then, the good housekeeper will know how to plan her soup days, and for whom to make this savory dish, one of the most delicious when well prepared.</p>
 
<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=67"/>

<p>I have before remarked, that the liquor in which meats of all kinds are boiled (except smoked meats), should be saved and used, either in soups or gravies. This liquor contains much of the essence of the meat (if the pot was kept closely covered, which it always should be when meats are boiling), and, if rightly prepared, will prove a great saving in the expense for animal food in a family. If the meats or poultry are boiled for the table, it is better not to use the liquor the first day. Pour it into a well-glazed earthen pot or pan, and let it stand till the next morning. Then skim off the fat, and strain the liquid into a clean <implement>soup-boiler.</implement> By this means you entirely <emph rend="italic">separate the blood from the meat,</emph> which is the great object of cookery, and should be as conscientiously attended to by the Christian, as abstaining from pork is by the Jew.</p>
<p>Most of the particles of blood, when meat is boiled rise in the form of scum; these should be carefully removed--but there are always stray particles left floating in the water, and when this liquor is strained through a sieve or cloth (a <implement>colander</implement> is not fine enough) there will be coagulated blood at the bottom in form of sediment. After the liquor is thus purified, you can add whatever vegetables you choose, rice, carrots, cabbage, onions, and potatoes are all used. If the liquor is too much, boil it awhile uncovered and let it evaporate. If it requires richness, you had better take some of the fat skimmed off--melt it in a saucepan with a spoonful of flour well stirred in--this unites with the fat and prevents it from floating like oil, on the top of the liquor. Then stir this mixture into the soup, add whatever flavors of seasoning you choose; pepper and sweet herbs are usually in favor.--Crackers toasted or hard bread may be added a short time before the soup is wanted; but do not put in those libels on civilized cookery, called <emph rend="italic">dumplings!</emph> One might about as well eat, with the hope of digesting, a brick from the ruins of Babylon, as one of the hard, heavy masses of boiled dough which usually pass under this name.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is on many accounts, preferable, that bread should be eaten <emph rend="italic">with</emph> rather than <emph rend="italic">in</emph> our soups. In the former case, the bread assists to cool the broth, which is otherwise almost always taken <emph rend="italic">too hot.</emph> Here is one great

cause of disease to the stomach from this article of diet. Besides, hot liquors greatly injure the teeth; and also by passing immediately into the blood, and thus circulating through the whole system, cause an unnatural glow and perspiration which often predisposes to colds, and is weakening to delicate constitutions. When we are well, and wish to continue so, it is best never to take food or drinks warmer than new milk. In sickness hot drinks are some times needed as stimulants.</p>

<p>Remarks on Fish--Cod--Salmon--Mackerel--Shad--Frying fish--Chowder--Shell fish--Oysters--Lobster--Condiments.</p>
<p>As food, fish is easier of digestion than meats are, with the exception of salmon; this kind of fish is extremely hearty food, and should be given sparingly to children and used cautiously by those who have weak stomachs, or who take little exercise.</p>
<p>The small trout, found in rivers, are the most delicate and suitable for invalids; lake fish are also excellent, and any kind of fresh-water fish, if cooked immediately after being caught, are always healthful.</p>
<p>But the ocean is the chief dependence for the fish-market, and there is little danger (if we except salmon and lobsters) that its kind of aliment will, in our country, be eaten to excess. It would be better for the health of those who do not labor, if they would use more fish and less flesh for food. But then fish cannot be rendered so palatable, because it does not admit the variety of cooking and flavors that other animal food does.</p>
<p>Fish is much less nutritious than flesh. The white kinds of fish, cod, haddock, flounders, white-fish, &amp;c., are the least nutritious; the oily kinds, salmon, eels, herrings, &amp;c., are more difficult to digest.</p>
<p>Shell fish have long held a high rank as restorative food; but a well-dressed chop or steak is much better to recruit the strength and spirits.</p>
<p>Cod, whiting, and haddock, are better for being a little salted, and kept one day before cooking.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">CONDIMENTS.</hd>
<p>The fashions of cookery, as well as of dress, have changed very materially since the days of worthy Mrs Glass, whose receipts seem little else but a catalogue of herbs, spices, essences, and all manner of flavors; a perfect "Magazine of Taste."</p>
<p>The crape cushion and periwig were not greater violations of the beauty of the natural hair and the comfort of the individual, than was the deluge of condiments, then thought indispensable to good cookery, to the pure taste of the palate and the real enjoyments of appetite.</p>
<p>We are just beginning to learn that the natural flavor of every kind of animal and vegetable production, suitable for food, is more delicate, and exquisite, when properly prepared, then any which can be imparted by an incongruous medley of seasoning. Still, there are many improvements to be made in the "art of cookery" before the perfection of simplicity will be obtained; before we learn the right process of dressing each kind of food, so as to retain all its best nutriment and essence; or discover the appropriate condiment and sauce for every dish.</p>
<p>To learn these things we must study the natural laws of the human constitution, and the arrangements of Providence. We find a great diversity of productions in the different climates--and there is little danger of error in assuming the rule that each sort is most healthful and to be used most 
 
<pb n="58" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=78"/>

freely, where it has been most plentifully provided by Nature. Thus in the climate of the Greenlander oil, and the fattest substances are necessary to sustain the human constitution, nor is any condiment or scarcely a vegetable required.</p>
<p>In the warm climates of the East, pepper and other spices are produced, and no doubt, required where the diet is chiefly vegetable or meats newly killed, and the stomach and system are relaxed by the heat. It is the nature of all kinds of spices, and high-seasoned food, to irritate, in a degree, the lining or inner membrane of the stomach; and they prove hurtful or healthful in proportion as this stimulus is needed or not.</p>
<p>In our own climate, the season of the year, as well as the age and constitution of the individual, must be taken into the calculation. During the cold weather, more fat meats and richer gravies may be eaten, but few or no condiments except a little salt is needed.</p>
<p>In summer fish and a large proportion, of vegetable diet should be used; meats more sparingly, and sauces made with cream and eggs instead of butter; (this, when new, should be eaten chiefly in substance with bread) and then condiments are doubtless advantageous, if not too freely used.</p>
<p>For those who exercise much in the open air, and require very hearty food, pepper, mustard and cayenne may be beneficial because they provoke thirst; and a very large amount of water is required to be taken into the stomach to supply the waste of the blood by perspiration.</p>
<p>But do not <emph rend="italic">give high seasoned food to children at any time.</emph></p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>Importance of vegetable food--Best manner of cooking--Potatoes--Turnips--Cabbage--Onions--Beets--Carrots--Parsnips--Peas--Beans--Squash--Cucumbers--Tomatoes.</p>
<p>THE importance of using a portion of vegetable food can hardly be overrated, though to make this our only diet does and must prove injurious, because contrary to man's nature and the arrangements of the Creator.</p>
<p>The farinaceous (or mealy) are far more nutritious than other vegetables; but none are sufficiently so to sustain the constitution under the cares and labors necessary to the full development of the energies of body and mind. And unless these can be developed and sustained, the rational and moral character of the human race will never be perfected.</p>
<p>Still, though animal food is never, except in peculiar cases of disease, to be wholly abandoned, we must be quite as scrupulous not to neglect the vegetable part of our diet. This is necessary in order to prevent the concentrated diet of flesh from too sudden and stimulating action. Besides, our nature demands a portion of vegetables to keep the system in proper and healthy order. <emph rend="italic">A mixed diet</emph> is the only right regimen--the proportions, of the different kinds of food, vary, with different ages and constitutions, in different climates, and seasons; still, in some degree, this rule should never be abandoned.</p>
<p>The very young require a large portion of mild farinaceous vegetables--such as rice, sago, tapioca and potatoes; the two first are very easy of digestion.</p>
<p>Potatoes contain much water and therefore remain longer in the stomach; for this reason they are not good for dyspeptics. Beans and peas, when well cooked, are healthy food for those who exercise much and eat considerable animal food. Vegetables require more attention in cooking than is generally bestowed. How often they are brought 
 
<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=80"/>

to table in a half raw or insipid state! Thus we have waxy, watery, or soddened potatoes, parboiled cabbage, and green peas so hard they might be used effectively as shot. If these dishes are eaten, they can hardly be digested;--but they rarely are taken freely; the consequence is that too much meat is used at dinner. If the vegetables were only cooked properly, the appetite for them would be increased as well as the power of digestion.</p>
<p>There are three things to be attented to in cooking vegetables; make them sufficiently soft--develop their best flavor; and correct any rank or disagreeable taste they may have. These things are very easily accomplished--Boil them sufficiently--change the water if they are rank or unpleasant--and add a little salt, sugar or spice, as the case may require.</p>
<p>Vegetables are always best when newly gathered--except the potato; that is better in winter if well kept.</p>
<p>They are in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty, that is, in their proper season.</p>
<p>Except spinach all vegetables should be boiled quickly (soft water is much the best) in an open vessel, and carefully skimmed.</p>
<hd align="center">POTATOES.</hd>
<p>Potatoes should be kept in the cellar covered and carefully sprouted, as soon as the spring opens.</p>
<p>The middling sized potatoes are best; the white mealy kind are better than the colored.</p>

<p>Nature of this diet--Preparation of puddings--Arrow root--Sago--Tapioca--Rice--Batter--Potato--Bread--Custard--Apple--Damson--Lemon--Christmas Pies--Not healthy food--Paste for pies--Apple pie--Rhubarb--Fruit--Squash--Pumpkin--Custard--Tarts--Puffs--Mince pies.</p>
<p>CONSIDERED in relation to health, there is not much to be said in favor of either of these kinds of diet, as usually managed; that is, taken after a full dinner of meat and vegetables. Many kinds of puddings are excellent and nutritious food; rice, sago and arrow-root, in particular; and if needed as food, nothing would be more healthy. The mischief is that these delicious compounds often tempt to repletion, which plain bread, cheese and fruit would not be so likely to do.</p>
<p>Dyspeptic people are generally injured by taking rich puddings or pies at any time. And there is a kind of pudding, made of fruit in <emph rend="italic">paste,</emph> and boiled, which those who wish to avoid dyspepsia should never taste. No woman who regards her own health or that of her family, should ever allow a <emph rend="italic">dumpling or paste pudding</emph> to be boiled in her house. I shall give no receipts for either. There is no way of boiling wheat <emph rend="italic">dough</emph> which can render it fit for food; it will be crude and heavy and lay hard in the stomach, unless a person has from nature or violent exercise, such a voracious appetite that, like the one described by Hood--"he could all but eat and digest himself."</p>
<p>Fruit mixed with batter, if rightly prepared, is far less objectionable; though this kind of pudding is not so nourishing or healthful as those made of rice, sago or indian meal, baked. A boiled indian pudding, if made nearly as thin as batter, is not very apt to be injurious; still made like hasty-pudding it is more easily digested.</p>
<p>In preparing nice puddings, always beat the eggs very light, yolks and whites apart; the flour should be dried and 
 
<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=84"/>

sifted; if currants are used, they must be carefully picked, washed, and dried, and then dusted with flour before being put into the batter--raisins must be stoned; sugar dried and pounded; spices must be very fine, and all the ingredients thoroughly mixed. It is better to mix the pudding an hour or two before it is to be baked or boiled.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">PIES.</hd>
<p>Pies are more apt to prove injurious to persons of delicate constitutions than puddings; because of the indigestible nature of the pastry.</p>
<p>Those who eat much of this kind of food, when made rich (and poor pies are poor things indeed) usually complain of the loss of appetite, and feel a disrelish for any but high seasoned food. It would really be a great improvement in the matter of health, (and without that we cannot long enjoy pleasure or even comfort in good living) as well as evince superior nicety of taste, if people would eat their delicious summer fruit with good light bread, instead of working up the flour with water and butter into a compound that almost defies the digestive powers, and baking therein the fruits, till they lose nearly all their fine original flavor. Apples are about the only fruit that seems intended for cooking; (pears and quinces are good to preserve); the stone fruits, cherries, plums, &amp;c. are absolutely ruined by it; and nearly all the summer berries are injured by baking. And yet women <emph rend="italic">will make</emph> pies; and mothers <emph rend="italic">will give</emph> them to their young children, when a bowl of bread and milk, with a little ripe fruit in it, would satisfy their unvitiated appetites better, and in every respect do them much more good.--Pies are best for winter food, because then we can bear a rich, concentrated diet, better than during the hot weather. In the spring and summer, when milk and eggs are plenty and fresh, we should use custards and all the light farinaceous puddings; and ripe fruits. In cold weather, there is less danger of injury from mince pies and plum puddings; still for the sedentary, the delicate, or dyspeptic they are never safe. And if the mistress of a family be a "good housekeeper"--that is if she thoroughly understand the nature of food and the effect of its various 
 
<pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=89"/>

combinations on the health of those for whom her table is spread, she will not permit the appearance of those kinds which can scarcely be taken by the strong and healthy without injury, and which are sure to prove hurtful to the young, weak, or invalid.</p>
<p>In making paste, particular care must be taken that the board, rolling-pin, cutters, &amp;c. are very clean and dry.</p>
<p>The flour used should always be of the best quality, dried and sifted.</p>

<p>Nature of fruits--Best times of using them--Ripe and fresh--Cooked--Preserves--Jellies--Custards--Cream, &amp;c.</p>
<p>FRUITS were the diet first allowed man; and it seems that the Eden taste still lingers in our race, for in childhood there is no food so eagerly sought and relished. But nothing which earth produces has escaped the curse, or rather mankind, by the excitement and indulgence of a depraved appetite, often convert the blessings and bounty of heaven into sources of disease and disquiet.</p>
<p>That fruits are naturally healthy in their season, if rightly taken, no one, who believes that the Creator is a kind and 
 
<pb n="75" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=95"/>

beneficent being, can doubt. And yet the use of summer fruits appears often to cause most fatal diseases, especially in children. Why is this? Because we do not conform to the natural laws in using this kind of diet. These laws are very simple and easy to understand.--Let the fruit be ripe when you eat it; and eat it when you require <emph rend="italic">food.</emph></p>
<p>Now, nearly one half of the summer fruits used are eaten in an unripe or decaying state; more than half sold in the cities are in this condition. And this unhealthy fruit is often taken when no food is needed, after the full dinner, or for pastime in the evening. It is given to children to amuse them or stop their crying, when they are often suffering from repletion. Is it a wonder that fruits make people and children sick under such circumstances?</p>
<p>In the country, fruits in their season, usually form part of the morning and evening meal of children with bread and milk; fresh gathered fruits; and they seldom prove injurious eaten in this manner. Indeed, though far the greatest quantity of fruit is eaten in the country, and some in an unripe state, yet very little comparatively, is used when it is decaying. And hence it doubtless is, that the diseases which so fatally afflict children in the cities, during the fruit season, are seldom of much consequence in the country.</p>
<p>The fruits sold in the city almost always are gathered in an unripe state, in order the better to bear the delay and disturbance of bringing to market; they are therefore in that most crude and unhealthy condition,--"rotten (or at least decaying) before they are ripe," and all their best qualities are lost. Do not give such fruit to your young children. If it is possible send or go with them into the country, during the fruit season, and let them ramble over the green hills and through the wide pastures, where in the grass or by the rough fences, grow those delicious fruits, the raspberry, or blackberry, and strawberry, and pick for themselves. There they will scarcely be persuaded to eat an unripe or decaying berry. If you cannot do this, keep such fruits as much as possible from their knowledge; for though it is undoubtedly of essential benefit to the health to use ripe fruits in the hot season, yet it is better to do without them entirely, than to eat them when utterly unfit for the stomach.</p>
 
<pb n="76" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=96"/>

<p>Stone fruits are still more objectionable, because the stones and skins frequently swallowed by children are entirely indigestible. Peach skins are very unhealthy and should never be eaten. In the southern cities, many bowel complaints are caused by the use of this fruit.</p>
<p>Apples and winter pears are very excellent food for children, indeed for almost any person in health; but best when eaten at breakfast or dinner. If taken late in the evening fruit often proves injurious. The old saying that apples are <emph rend="italic">gold in the morning, and silver at noon, and lead at night</emph> is pretty near the truth. Both apples and pears are often good and nutritious when baked or stewed, for those delicate constitutions that cannot bear raw fruit.</p>
<p>Much of the fruit, gathered when unripe, might be rendered fit for food by preserving in sugar. This is an expensive article of diet, if freely used, and therefore there is less danger that people will indulge to excess.</p>
<p>I would not recommend sweetmeats or fruit sauces at every meal; but a portion of these delicate preparations are healthy and economical; they decorate the table and give zest to the evening meal of plain bread and butter, when otherwise rich cakes would be craved. Eaten with custards or rice, preserves or ripe berries are excellent in the summer season, when such kinds of food, nutritious, yet mild and light, are essential to the comfort of the sedentary, indeed, of all, except those who exercise much in the open air.</p>
<p>The following receipts for this kind of cookery, which is truly a lady's department, are those combining most fully pleasantness of taste with economy and suitableness for family use.</p>
<p>Fruit for preserves is better not to be over ripe; gather it on a <emph rend="italic">dry</emph> day, and <emph rend="italic">after</emph> a dry day if possible.</p>
<p>Good sugar is cheaper in the end than poor for this use; but for family preserves, if loaf or good lump sugar is used, it need not be clarified. Much time and waste of sugar is thus spared.</p>

<p>Remarks on cake--Manner of making--Various kinds--Sponge cake--Seed--Macaroons--Kisses--Sugar drops--Rice--Rice cakes with butter--Carraway--Sugar--Tea--Gingerbread--Light cake--Composition--Tunbridge--German puffs--Common plum--Rich--Pound--Heart--Iceing for cakes--Warm cakes for breakfast and tea.</p>
<p>CAKE is one of the luxuries of the table, and like all luxuries must be sparingly indulged in order to be enjoyed, its value depending chiefly on its rarity. If gold were plenty as granite it would be little prized; and were cakes used freely as bread, it would not only prove injurious to the constitution, but we should soon tire of the luscious compound.</p>
<p>As a delicacy at the tea-table, occasionally introduced, cake is not objectionable, unless made very rich with butter. The common gingerbread and several varieties of the cheap and simple cakes, which will be given in this work, are much better as a part of the evening meal than hot biscuit or even a full supper of cold bread and butter in the winter season, when butter is usually too salt to be healthful.</p>
<p>But never spread butter on cake; it is a sin against that economy and propriety which domestic rules should always 
 
<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=104"/>

exhibit; and besides, it renders the cake too rich for the stomach.</p>
<p>The kinds of cake most apt to prove injurious are pound cake and rich plum cake; but very little of these should ever be eaten, and if they could be wholly superseded by the <emph rend="italic">sponge cake</emph> and other light varieties it would be much better for the health of those who are in the habit of frequenting parties. Sponge cake, or those made in a similar manner, chiefly of eggs, sugar and flour, beaten light and well baked, would rarely prove injurious, if not eaten immoderately.</p>
<p>It will be well, however, always to bear in mind, that cake of every sort, is to be partaken of as a luxury, not eaten for a full meal. Those who attend evening parties several times in a week can hardly take too small a quantity of the sweet and rich preparations. Many a young lady loses her appetite, bloom and health by indulgence in these tempting but pernicious delicacies; and dyspeptic complaints frequently are aggravated, if not originated, by the absurd fashion of making our evening circles places for eating and drinking rather than social and mental enjoyment. They manage these things better in Paris.</p>
<p>Those ladies who live in the country must make their own cake; but for those who dwell in cities it is usually cheaper to buy it ready made for parties; then it is sure to be of good quality, and as the quantity needed can be pretty accurately calculated, it will not be so expensive as to bake it at home, where considerable waste in the kitchen must be expected.</p>
<p>In preparing cake, the flour should be dried before the fire, sifted and weighed; currants washed and dried; raisins stoned; sugar pounded and rolled fine and sifted; and all spices after well dried at the fire, pounded and sifted.</p>
<p>Almonds should be blanched, which is done by pouring hot water over them, and after standing some minutes taking off the skins, then throwing it into cold water. When not pounded they should be cut lengthwise into thin bits. Lemon and orange peel must be pared very thin and pounded with a little sugar.</p>
<p>Butter, after being weighed, should be laid in cold water, 
 
<pb n="85" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=105"/>

or washed in rose water; if salt, wash it well in several waters.</p>
<p>The yolks and whites of eggs should always be separately beaten in making nice cake, and strained. First weigh or measure the ingredients; then sift the flour; powder the sugar; grind the spice; prepare the fruit; stir the butter and sugar together; and the last thing beat the eggs.</p>

how they shall live, but cook whatever they can obtain in the readiest way; and there is the luxurious poor, who live on credit and by "speculations;" these are generally most fastidious in appetite and careless of expense; they would be disgusted at the thought of a "cheap dish."

<ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> is the cheapest, and a bushel furnishes more nutriment than the same quantity of wheat. It is also a generally healthy diet, and those who wish to practise close economy should use much of this meal in their families.</p>
<p>It makes excellent puddings, and warm cakes, which are much less apt to oppress the stomach than hot wheat bread or short cakes of any kind. And good, light, nourishing bread may be made by using five parts of <ingredient>indian</ingredient> and one of <ingredient>rye</ingredient> or <ingredient>wheat flour,</ingredient> (see receipts for "Rye and Indian Bread"); which is better than to cook it hot at every meal.</p>

<p>Remarks on family drinks--Coffee--Shells--Chocolate--Tea--Common Beer--Spruce--Ginger--Lemonade--Oragneade--Currant wine--Water.</p>
<p>THERE is one rule for drinks which no <emph rend="italic">woman</emph> should violate;--never make any preparation, of which <emph rend="italic">alcohol</emph> forms a part, for family use!</p>
<p>Let distilled liquors, of every name and sort, be religiously banished from that sanctuary of domestic comfort, <emph rend="italic">our homes,</emph> and the appetite for them would, in a great degree, become extinguished. And if we rightly feel the importance of guarding our own families from the insidious destroyer, can we be guilty of the <emph rend="italic">in</emph>hospitality of pressing on our friends the poison, which, however it may be disguised by delicious flavors, is still the same in character, the deadly foe of social improvement and human happiness!</p>
<p>Leaving the preparations of alcohol out of our account, the other mixtures for family drinks which require receipts, are few and simple. The one which demands most care 
 
<pb n="101" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=121"/>

and consideration is coffee. That this beverage is rarely made right in our country, all who have drank it in France or the East, affirm; and whether the bad effects it not unfrequently produces on the health of those who use it freely, arise from this defect in preparation, or from our climate, or the nature of coffee itself, has never been satisfactorily settled. It certainly does in America often prove injurious to those who drink it very strong; and therefore it is best to use it cautiously; those who are at all inclined to be dyspeptic or nervous should abstain altogether.</p>
<p>There are several methods of making coffee, each highly recommended--I cannot decide which is best, but the following way is a <emph rend="italic">good</emph> one.</p>
<recipe class1="beverages">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE COFFEE.</purpose>

Take <ingredient>fresh-roasted coffee,</ingredient> (a quarter of a pound for three persons is the rule, but <emph rend="italic">less</emph> will do;) allow two table-spoonfuls for each person, grind it just before making, put it in a basin and break into it an <ingredient>egg, yolk,</ingredient> <ingredient>white,</ingredient> shell and all. Mix it up with the spoon to the consistence of <implement>mortar,</implement> put in a warm not <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the <implement>coffee pot;</implement> let it boil up and <emph rend="italic">break</emph> three times; then stand a few minutes and it will be as clear as amber, and the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> will give it a rich taste.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="beverages">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE COFFEE.</purpose>

Pour <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> into your <implement>coffee pot,</implement> and then stir in your <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> a spoonful at a time, allowing three to every pint of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> this makes <emph rend="italic">strong</emph> coffee. Stir it to prevent the mixture from boiling over, as the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> swells, and to force it to combine with the <ingredient>water.</ingredient> This will be done after it has boiled gently a few minutes. Then let it stand and boil slowly for half an hour; remove it from the fire, and pour in a teacup of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and set it in the corner to settle.--As soon as it becomes clear, it is to be poured, gently, into a clean <implement>coffee-pot</implement> for the table.</p>
<p>Made in this manner it may be kept two or three days in summer, and a week in winter; you need only heat it over when wanted.</p>
<p>The grounds and sediment, may be boiled over and used once for coffee.</p>
 
<pb n="102" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=122"/>

<p><ingredient>Fish skin</ingredient> is often used to settle coffee, and will answer tolerably well, if rightly prepared. Pull off the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> from a <ingredient>salted cod,</ingredient> scrape, wash and dry it in the oven, after removing the bread--then divide it in pieces about an inch square, and put it in a paper bag for use. It will require one bit for every pint of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> put in when you make the coffee. Several substitutes for coffee are used by those who cannot afford the real berry. Rye, pease, &amp;c.--none of these are very healthy, and certainly are not good--The best substitute is <ingredient>toasted crust of bread,</ingredient> but it is cheaper to drink water, and if taken for a little time will be as palatable; or else use</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CHOCOLATE.</purpose>

To each square of <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> scraped off fine, and put in the pot, allow a pint, (less if you like it strong) of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Stir it while boiling; and let it be uncovered. Let it boil about fifteen minutes, or half an hour, then pour in your <ingredient>cream</ingredient> or <ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> and let it boil up.--<ingredient>Nutmeg</ingredient> grated over a cup of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> improves the flavor.</p>

The foregoing receipts will teach the manner of preparing those drinks which are most agreeable to the palate, suitable for the purposes of hospitality, economy and that attention to the real welfare of a family which should never be neglected.</p>
<p>But after all, the best beverage for the healthy, who wish to continue well, is good pure cold WATER! The danger in recommending it as the common and constant drink of all persons, at all times and places, arises from the difficulty of finding it pure and good. There is no doubt that, besides the diseases known to be generated by drinking bad water, serious injury is frequently inflicted on the constitution from the long continued use of much that is called <emph rend="italic">good,</emph> that is, though known to be <emph rend="italic">hard</emph> and consequently impregnated with chemical solutions of lime, still it does not taste unpleasant, and is clear. But this <emph rend="italic">hard</emph> water always leaves a mineral matter on the skin, when we use it in washing, which renders the hands and face rough and liable to chap. Does not this water, if we drink it, likewise corrode and injure the fine membranes of the stomach? The Boston people who constantly use hard water for all purposes of cookery and drink, certainly have bad complexions, sallow, dry, and <emph rend="italic">hard</emph>-looking; and complaints of the stomach or dyspepsia are very common among them.</p>
<p>A Salem gentleman declared that when his daughters, who frequently visited at Boston, passed two or three weeks at a time there, he could see a very material change in their complexions. At Salem there is plenty of soft water, and the ladies of that ancient town are famed for their beauty, which is chiefly owing (its superiority I mean) to a 
 
<pb n="105" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=125"/>

peculiarly fair, delicate tincture of skin, contrasted with the half petrified of appearance of those who are obliged to drink <emph rend="italic">hard water</emph> always, and often to wash in it.</p>
<p>The best water to drink as well as wash with, when it can be obtained pure, or rendered so, is <emph rend="italic">rain-water.</emph> This may generally be effected with a little care and expense. A clean reservoir to collect the rain water is needed, and a portable <implement>filterer</implement>--that is all the expense; the care of filtering, every young lady who values her health or <emph rend="italic">complexion,</emph> always synonymous, will gladly undertake.</p>
<p>Filtering cools the water, and in the summer ice may be used.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">THE DAIRY.</hd>
<p>Always to make <emph rend="italic">good</emph> butter or cheese shows great care and excellent judgment in the farmer's wife. When every department of the dairy is kept perfectly neat, there is hardly any exhibition of woman's industry more likely to make her husband proud or gratify a beholder of good sense and benevolence than the sight of a neat dairy-room filled with the rich, valuable productions which her skill has fashioned from the milk of the cow.</p>
<p>"The farmer's wife," says the accomplished Addison, "who has made nine hundred cheeses, and brought up half a dozen healthy children, is far more <emph rend="italic">amiable</emph> in the eyes of unprejudiced reason, than the fine lady, who has made two millions of insipid visits, and propagated scandal from one end of the town to the other." The moral of this sentiment is true; rational employment, the industry either of hand or head, which produces benefit to society, is the real test of excellence in character,--and few American ladies desire any other standard.</p>
<p>The secret of success in the dairy is strict attention and scrupulous neatness, in all its operations. The best time to make butter is in June, when the pastures are rich with clover, and October, when the <emph rend="italic">fall</emph> feed is in its perfection.</p>
<p>July, August, and September are the months for cheese; then the rich new milk and cream cheeses are made.</p>
<p>Dairy work must be learned by practice, and requires as nice judgement and taste as cake making. A few general directions may be followed to advantage; but there have not yet been any settled rules for this work which will insure good butter and cheese; it seems to depend very much on the skill of the individual manager, who does not often choose to communicate the secret of her infallible success. It is to be hoped that some of the intelligent women who 
 
<pb n="111" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=131"/>

are eminently successful in managing the dairy, will give the result of their experience--we might then frame receipts which would be very advantageous to the young farmer's wife, and of great benefit to the public; for it is a real calamity to have poor butter and cheese sent to market. Bad butter, particularly, is not only unhealthy, but it entirely spoils every good article of food in which it is mingled. Never purchase it, let it be ever so cheap. It is far better to eat molasses, or honey, or preserves with bread, and use lard, beef drippings, suet, &amp;c. for gravies and shortening, than to use bad butter.</p>
<p>To ensure good butter you must always scald your pans, pails, &amp;c. in hot water, and then heat them by the fire, or in the hot sun, so that they may be perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>Keep your cream in a cool place in the summer, and <implement>churn</implement> twice a week.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Work out all the butter-milk</emph>--this must be done or the butter will not keep well; and do not make the butter too salt.</p>
<p>Never put butter in a pine tub.</p>
<p>Keep your cheese in a dark, dry room, and turn and rub them every day. The <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> fried out of <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> is the best preservative to rub on cheese, and gives a rich color and smoothness to the rind.</p>
<p>Never wash your cheese shelves; but always wipe them clean with a dry cloth, when you turn your cheese.</p>
<p>Do not heat the milk too hot, it should never, for new milk cheese, be more than blood warm; be sure that your rennet is good, and do not use more than it requires to bring the curd.</p>
<p>Cut the curd, when fully formed, carefully with a knife; never break it with your hand; and be very particular when draining it from the whey, not to squeeze or handle the curd; if you make the <emph rend="italic">white whey</emph> run from the curd, you lose much of the richness of the cheese.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">HINTS TO HELP.</hd>
<p>Domestics in American families are very differently situated from persons of the same class in any other part of the world. Few enter the employment with any intention of remaining servants; it is only for a present resource to obtain a living and a little cash so that they may begin business or house-keeping for themselves.</p>
<p>American <emph rend="italic">help,</emph> therefore, should be very particular in their good behavior, and be careful to do by their employers, as they will want <emph rend="italic">help</emph> to do by them, when their turn to keep domestics shall arrive. Never leave a good place because a little fault has been found with your work; it is a very great injury to a domestic to change her place often; she will soon have the name of being bad tempered, and besides, she cannot gain friends; you must remain sometime in a family before they will become attached to you. And if you are, as is generally the case, out of employment for a week before you go to a new place, you lose your time; and often have to pay for board too; thus a loss of two or three week's wages is incurred, because you will not bear to be reproved, even for a fault. What folly! thus to punish yourself for the sake of punishing your mistress, even if she did blame you without cause. The better way is to remain and behave so well that she shall be made to acknowledge your excellence; which she will be pretty sure to do if she finds you faithfully try to please her.</p>
<p>Do not think it degrades you to endeavor to please your employer. It surely adds to your respectability, for it shows, that you live with people you respect. You are bound to please your employers as far as you honestly can, while you receive your wages. No person hires a domestic to be idle, or cross, or disrespectful. It is worse than theft to take wages from your employers which you must know you have not earned, if you have been unfaithful, 
 
<pb n="113" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=133"/>

impertinent and, quarrelsome, and made them constant trouble.</p>
<p>Resolve, therefore, when you go as <emph rend="italic">help</emph>, to prove <emph rend="italic">help</emph> in deed, which you will be if you practise the following rules.</p>
<p>Always treat and speak of your employers with respect.</p>
<p>Be faithful and honest in managing all that they entrust to you.</p>
<p>Be kind and obliging to every body, particularly to all the domestics of the family.</p>
<p>In a word.--Do to others, in all things, as you would wish them to do by you in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>If you conduct thus, you will, though working in the kitchen, be as really respectable and independent as the lady in the parlor. In truth she will be more dependent on your assistance than you will be on her for employment, and she will feel this, and treat you with the consideration and kindness which your merit deserves. But do not presume on this favor, and grow slack and careless. As long as you find it necessary to receive wages, be conscientious to perform all your duties as help.</p>
<p>Never think any part of your business too trifling to be well done.</p>
<p>The foregoing are general rules; a few particular directions may be needed.</p>
<p>One of the faults which a cook should most seriously guard against, is bad temper. She has a good many trials. Her employment, in the summer season, is not a pleasant or healthy one--obliged as she is, to be over the hot fire, and confined, often in a dark, close kitchen. Then she sometimes has a difficult lady to please, who does not know when the work is done well, and often gives contradictory or impracticable orders.</p>
<p>And the other domestics, frequently interrupt the arrangements of the cook; or, she is not furnished with proper implements and articles. All these things try her patience, and if it <emph rend="italic">sometimes</emph> fails we ought not too much to blame her. But she need not be always <emph rend="italic">cross.</emph> And she should remember, too, her privileges--mistress of the kitchen, the highest wages, and, if she conducts well, the favorite always of her employers.</p>
 
<pb n="114" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=134"/>

<p>It is in the power of the cook to do much for the comfort and prosperity of the family; if she is economical and conducts with propriety, the whole establishment goes on <emph rend="italic">pleasantly;</emph> but if she is cross, <emph rend="italic">intemperate</emph> and wasteful, the mischief and discomfort she causes are very great. Never let the family have reason to say--"the cook is always cross!"</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Intemperance</emph> is said to be the failing of cooks, oftener than of other domestics. It is a vice which if persisted in, will soon destroy the character and usefulness of the best cook. Every one who desires to sustain a respectable station in her employment must abstain <emph rend="italic">totally</emph> from spiritous liquors. "Touch not, taste not, handle not." It is poison to your blood,--it is death to your reputation, if not to your body and soul.</p>
<p>Country girls who come to the cities as help, because they can there obtain large wages, should be careful in their diet. Remember that as you cannot take so much exercise in the open air, you must live sparingly at first or the change will injure your health. And all that injures the health, injures also the bloom and beauty of youth.</p>
<p>To take a young woman, one of our farmers' daughters, from the free, pure air of the country, and confine her in the hot kitchen, often under ground, of one of our crowded city establishments, is such a change, that unless she is very particular in her care of herself, will soon cause her to look old and haggard and disagreeable. Her hair will be often matted with sweat and dust and her complexion like a mummy. To avoid these unpleasant results, let the cook, from the first, adopt the following rules--</p>
<p>1st.--Eat regular meals, instead of tasting of every good thing you cook, till you have no appetite for food.</p>
<p>2d.--Keep your sleeping room well aired and your skin clean.</p>
<p>The best way is to wash yourself thoroughly when going to bed; comb your hair also, and wear a night cap or handkerchief on your head. The next morning, you will only require to smooth your hair, not take it down, and wash your hands. You can thus be quickly dressed, and your face will not burn or redden while cooking over the fire, as it will when recently washed. It would look neater, 
 
<pb n="115" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=135"/>

and keep your hair much smoother if you would wear a cap or handkerchief while at work, as English servants do.</p>
<p>Let your dress be of good durable materials, that will wash well; keep it clean as possible, and always wear an apron.</p>
<p>In the afternoon when the work is done, then you can wash, and dress yourself as neatly as you choose, only remember that a domestic in a showy flimsy gown, and decked out with pinchbeck rings and ear-ornaments always makes a ridiculous figure in the eyes of every sensible person. Because such persons see that you are spending your hard earned wages for that which really does you no good.</p>
<p>Keep your kitchen, and all the utensels clean and neat as possible. Sweep the chimney often, with an old broom kept for the purpose, so that no soot may collect to fall down on the dishes at the fire, and be sure that the hearth is neat as a table.</p>
<p>Always have plenty of hot water ready; and take care that your wiping cloths are washed every day.</p>
<p>The three rules you must follow, if you would always have your work done well are these--</p>
<p>"Do every thing at the proper time.</p>
<p>Keep every thing in its proper place.</p>
<p>Use every thing for its proper purpose."</p>
<p>If your mistress professes to understand cookery, the best way will be to follow her directions; if you find the dish is not so good as when you cooked it your own way, respectfully ask her to let you try once alone. But never be angry or pout when you are told how your employer wishes to have the work done.</p>
<p>The great fault of the Irish <emph rend="italic">help</emph> is, that they undertake to do what they have never learned. They will not acknowledge their ignorance; if they would do this, and patiently try to learn, they would soon, with their natural quickness, become good cooks--if they have good teachers. And what a privilege and blessing it is to a poor Irish girl, who has only lived in a hovel, with scarcely an article of furniture, save the pot "to boil the praties," to be instructed in household work! It is really a fortune to her; she can then always have good places and good pay, and soon clothe herself well and lay up money.</p>
 
<pb n="116" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=136"/>

<p>There are benevolent and sensible ladies who do act thus kindly by the Irish girl; not only learn her how to work in the kitchen, but teach her needlework, and instruct her in reading and writing.</p>
<p>If you have had such a kind mistress, my poor girl, for the honor of old Ireland be grateful and faithful to your benefactress; and show yourself worthy to be the mother of American citizens; for to such good fortune, your children, should you marry, will be entitled.</p>
<p>There is no danger that our domestics will have too much ambition, if it be of the right kind--the ambition of doing their duty as faithful, capable <emph rend="italic">help,</emph> while they continue to work for others. But I would wish every young female domestic to <emph rend="italic">hope</emph> that she may sometime be mistress of her <emph rend="italic">own house;</emph> and I would urge her to improve every opportunity she has of learning the best and most prudent manner of doing all kinds of work. Then she will be fitted to make her husband happy and bring up her children to be respectable members of society.</p>
<p>One of the most certain evidences that she is worthy to enjoy prosperity, is her faithfulness to promote the interest of those for whom she works. If she is really trustworthy she will show it in all her conduct.</p>
<p>There is a class of cooks who cannot be trusted; every thing they dare to take is slyly carried out of the house and given to their friends--and they go on with this system of pilfering till they are turned away from every respectable place.</p>
<p>Do not be tempted to begin this system, nor think that the broken bits, which the family may not need, belong to you. The mistress of the house must manage these charities; ask her, and if she give you leave to dispose of the broken pieces, be very careful not to <emph rend="italic">make fragments</emph> unnecessarily for the sake of giving them to your poor relations.</p>
<p>Act, in all these things, as you would if your employer was looking on you; and forget not that One, to whom you are more responsible than to any earthly master or mistress, is constantly watching you.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">HINTS TO HOUSEKEEPERS.</hd>
<p>"It is much the same in governments as in families; those statesmen and housewives, who make a great bustle about the difficulties they are in, are the very ones who are too indolent, too awkward, or too ignorant to remove them."--MADAME ROLAND.</p>
<p>THE term <emph rend="italic">housekeeper,</emph> in this book is used in its American signification, the same as "Mistress of the family," or "Lady of the house."</p>
<p>In our republican land, thanks to its rational institutions, which preserve in a high degree of purity the moral relations of domestic life, it is rare to find a married woman who does not superintend personally, the economy of her own household, let the wealth, profession, or political station of her husband be what it may. The most delicate lady, unless her ill health were the pretext, would scarcely boast of retaining a hired housekeeper to perform her duties; and no lady would gain credit or consequence in society by so doing. In truth our richest and most fashionable women, are often models of good housekeeping; many whose talents and accomplishments would adorn the first circles of Europe, perform the woman's part of superintending the affairs of their own household, as scrupulously and well as though they had been taught nothing besides.</p>
<p>That the American ladies are better educated in all the solid branches of learning, than those of any other country in the world there is no doubt--even Englishmen acknowledge their superior intelligence--and their good housekeeping proves the assertion of Miss Sedgwick true, namely, that the more intelligent a woman becomes, other things being equal, the more judiciously she will manage her domestic concerns. And we may add, that the more real knowledge she possesses of the great principles of morals, philosophy and human happiness, the more importance she will attach to her station and the name of a "good housekeeper." It is only the frivolous, and those who are superficially taught, 
 
<pb n="118" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=138"/>

or only instructed in showy accomplishments, who despise and neglect the ordinary duties of life as beneath their notice. Such persons have not sufficient clearness of reason to see that "Domestic Economy" includes every thing which is calculated to make people love home and feel happy there.</p>
<p>One of the first duties of woman in domestic life is to understand the quality of provisions and the preparation of wholesome food.</p>
<p>The powers of the mind, as well as those of the body, are greatly dependent on what we eat and drink. The stomach must be in health, or the brain cannot act with its utmost vigor and clearness, nor can there be strength of muscle to perform the purposes of the will.</p>
<p>But further, woman to be qualified for the duty which Nature has assigned her, that of promoting the health, happiness and improvement of her species, must understand the natural laws of the human constitution, and the causes which often render the efforts she makes to please the appetite of those she loves, the greatest injury which could be inflicted upon them. Often has the affectionate wife caused her husband a sleepless night and severe distress, which, had an enemy inflicted she would scarcely have forgiven--because she has prepared for him food which did not agree with his constitution or habits.</p>
<p>And many a tender mother has, by pampering and inciting the appetites of her young sons, laid the foundation of their future course of selfishness and profligacy.</p>
<p>If the true principles of preparing food were understood these errors would not be committed, for the housekeeper would then feel sure that the best food was that which best nourished and kept the whole system in healthy action; and that such food would be best relished, because whenever the health is injured the appetite is impaired or vitiated. She would no longer allow those kinds of food, which reason and experience show are bad for the constitution, to appear at her table.</p>
<p>Among those kinds of food which the good housekeeper should scrupulously banish from her table, is that of <emph rend="italic">hot leavened bread.</emph> From what I have seen and from the nature of this almost indigestible food, when taken in large quantities, I believe it more often lays the foundation of diseases 
 
<pb n="119" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=139"/>

of the stomach, than any other kind of nourishment, used among us. Hot bread is eaten, morning and evening, at many of our city boarding houses; and at establishments connected with the places of education for the young. And there it is that the incipient disease, which terminates in <emph rend="italic">dyspepsia,</emph> (an indefinable word implying almost every sort of distress and anguish to which the human frame is subject) is contracted. The want of sufficient exercise, or too strict attention to business or study may, and no doubt does, have much influence in predisposing to this disease. But it is the <emph rend="italic">hot bread,</emph> lying undigested, and of course <emph rend="italic">hard and heavy</emph> in the stomach, which prostrates the system and thus makes the mental fatigue injurious.</p>
<p>When much bodily exertion is used, in the open air, <emph rend="italic">hot bread,</emph> as well as all other kinds of heavy food, is comparatively harmless. Hard laboring people in the country, seldom suffer from indigestion. Still there are cases of disease, and the good housekeeper even in the country, should beware of placing this food before her family. If you are out of bread, it is much better, both as regards economy and health, to bake an indian cake by the fire, or make batter cakes, or even a short cake, if you do not put in too much butter, than to cut a <emph rend="italic">hot loaf from the oven.</emph> Unleavened bread when eaten warm, is more easily digested than leavened; or if, in the former, you use pearlash or sal&#230;ratus, it is still healthier. Yet the best bread for constant use, is light, leavened bread, from one to five or six days old. This may be toasted if you like variety. But do not, as you value the health and happiness of those who sit at your table, place before them hot leavened bread or biscuit.</p>
<p>Another kind of food, which ought to be banished from modern tables is <emph rend="italic">meat pies.</emph> It seems strange that this kind of barbarous cookery should hold its place, since the introduction of so many excellent vegetables to eat with animal food; and since such substantial diet is not now required as was needed when nearly all labor had to be performed by the physical strength of man. The Black Knight and Friar Tuck could take an enormous meal of venison, pastry washed down with wine without any danger of injury, for their exercises in the open air, and the weight of armor which the knight bore, required this concentrated 
 
<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=140"/>

and stimulating food to sustain their strength; but now when the modes of life have so far abated the muscular power of men, that it takes the united strength of five to lift a knight in armor into his saddle, would the same kind and quantity of food be beneficial?</p>
<p>Some may think that if this food were still as commonly eaten, men would now have more strength--but it would not be so, unless they used as much and as violent exercise in the open air as was then the custom. It is only the <emph rend="italic">food that is digested</emph> which gives strength and really nourishes the system; when the mode of life is sedentary and confined, the powers of digestion are soon weakened, and we must adapt our diet to this condition of our nature. I have therefore entirely omitted receipts for meat pies; and though sometimes those who labor very hard may eat them without much danger, yet it would be more safe, as well as saving, to dress the meat by itself, and use vegetables and bread with it, rather than make it into a high seasoned pie, with rich crust, a dish commonly eaten without vegetables.</p>
<p>Another improvement in this dietetic system of cookery is the entire exclusion of distilled spirits. I have not permitted the name of <emph rend="italic">rum or brandy</emph> to sully a receipt in this book--There is no need of these as condiments; and though men may not be willing to relinquish their legal <emph rend="italic">right</emph> to the use of such liquors, yet I cannot believe, any man will regret their banishment from the cook's department. No father who deserves the name can wish to have his children taught to love the taste of rum and brandy from having it mixed with their food.</p>
<p>If woman will decidedly and entirely banish ardent spirits<ref target="n008">* </ref>from the household arrangements, and they can do 
 
<pb n="121" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=141"/>

this if they choose, the progress of true temperance habits would soon either make temperance laws unnecessary, or cause them to be respected and obeyed.</p>
<ednote>The Following Footnote Appearend at the End of Page 120 and Page 121 in the Original text.</ednote>
<p id="n008" size="smaller">*Rum or brandy is used by some ladies as cosmetics to wash the face and hair, or as a remedy against colds, &amp;c. to bathe the head and feet.</p>
<p size="smaller">It is a very mistaken notion that these heating, drying liquids will make the hair grow--except it be to grow gray--or the complexion fair and smooth. There is always a sort of stickiness left on the skin after washing in rum, which pure soft water never leaves. This stickiness closes the pores of the skin and thus proves really injurious to its healthy action, and consequently beauty. I have known one example of this effect of rum which was not at all favorable; a lady, in consequence of a nervous affection in her jaw, had used rum for fourteen years to wash in--not a drop of water had touched her face or neck during that time. She was not very old, but her skin looked as dry and shrivelled as a baked sweet apple--you could scarcely put down a pin's point without touching a wrinkle.</p>
<p size="smaller">In regard to the use of rum, brandy, &amp;c. as a medicine, as far as my observation has extended, when considered as family remedies, they never effect a cure. Those persons who are in the habit of using them always require them. If you wish to be well and have your family enjoy health, do not use rum or brandy in any way as medicines.</p>
<p>But the art of selecting and preparing food, or seeing that this is done by others, constitutes only a part of the good housekeeper's duty. She ought to understand the character and capacity of each member of her family, know how to assign, advantageously, the different kinds of work to her help, to calculate expenses, provide for exigencies, and remedy, as far as possible, all the mistakes and accidents which occur in her housekeeping.</p>
<p>Far the greater proportion of households, throughout our whole country, are managed without the aid of much hired help, by the females of each family. The maxim, "if you would be well served you must serve yourself," has considerable truth in it; at least those families who serve themselves, escape many vexations of spirit, because, if the work be not very well done, when we do it with our own hands, we are more apt to be satisfied. There are some sorts of domestic work, that of dairy work is one, which no hired help would be competent to discharge. This must be done by a wife or daughter, who feels a deep personal interest in the prosperity of her husband or father. Many of our farmer's wives are among the best housekeepers in the land, possessing that good sense, vigor of mind, native delicacy of taste or tact, and firm conscientiousness, which gift the character with power to attempt every thing that duty demands. These are the "noble matronage" which our republic should honor; for it is the sons of such mothers who have ever stood foremost to defend or serve their country--</p>
<p size="smaller">"With word, or pen, or pointed steel."</p>
<p>One of the greatest defects in the present system of female education, is the almost total neglect of showing the 
 
<pb n="122" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=142"/>

young lady how to apply her learning so as to improve her domestic economy. It is true that necessity generally teaches, or rather obliges her to learn this science after she is married; but it would have saved her from many anxious hours and tears and troubles, if she had learned how to make bread and coffee, and cook a dinner before she left her father's house; and it would have been better still, if she had been instructed at school to regard this knowledge, as an indispensable accomplishment in the education of a young lady.</p>
<p>I was once told by a lady of Boston, that when she was married she scarcely knew how a single dish should be prepared. The first day of her housekeeping the cook came for orders--"what would she have for dinner?"</p>
<p>The lady told her, among other items, that she would have an apple pudding.</p>
<p>"How shall I make it?" was the question which the lady was unable to answer; she knew no more how to make a pudding than to square the circle. She evaded the question as well as she could, by telling the girl to make it in the usual way. But the circumstance was a powerful lesson on the inconveniences of ignorance to the housekeeper. The lady possessed good sense, and was a woman of right principles. She felt it was her duty to know how to order her help--that wealth did not free her from responsibility in her family. She set herself diligently to the study of cookery, and by consulting friends, watching the operations of her servants, and doing many things herself, she has become a most excellent housekeeper.</p>
<p>For the young bride, who is entirely ignorant of her household duties, this is an encouraging example; let her follow it if she would be happy and respected at home. But it would be better to begin her lessons a little earlier; it is not every woman who has sufficient strength of mind to pursue such a rigid course of self-education. And no lady can be comfortable, unless she possesses a knowledge of household work; if she need not perform it herself, she must be able to teach her help, otherwise she will always have <emph rend="italic">bad servants.</emph></p>
<p>I am aware that it is the fashion with many ladies to disparage Irish domestics, call them stupid, ignorant, imprudent, 
 
<pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=143"/>

ungrateful, the plagues of housekeeping. That they are ignorant is true enough; it does require skill, patience, and judgement, to teach a raw Irish girl how to perform the work in a gentleman's family; but they are neither stupid nor ungrateful, and if they are taught in the right manner, they prove very capable, and are most faithful and affectionate domestics.</p>
<p>A friend of mine, who is just what a woman ought to be, capable of directing--even <emph rend="italic">doing</emph> if necessary, in the kitchen as well as shining in the drawing room, hired one of these poor despised Irish girls, new from the land of the Shamrock, who only understood the way of doing work in a hovel, yet, like all her class, she told the lady "sure she could do any thing she wanted." The lady, however, did not trust the girl to make any experiments, but went to the kitchen with her and taught her, or rather did the work herself, and allowed the <emph rend="italic">help</emph> to look on and learn by example, which for such is much more effectual than lectures. When the dinner was nearly ready, the lady retired to dress, telling Julia to watch the roast, and she would return soon and show her how to prepare it for the table. We may imagine with what utter bewilderment the poor girl had been overwhelmed during this, her first lesson in civilized life. The names of the articles of furniture used in the kitchen as well as their uses, were entirely unknown to her; and she had seen so many new things done, which she was expected to remember, that it must have made her heart-sick to reflect how much she had to learn. But there was one thing she thought she understood, that was to cook potatoes. These were done, and she would show the lady she knew how to prepare them for the table.</p>
<p>When the lady returned, she found the girl seated in the middle of the floor, the potatoes in her lap, while she, with a very satisfied look, was peeling them with her fingers!</p>
<p>Are there not ladies who would have exclaimed--"Oh, the stupid, ignorant, dirty creature! She cannot be taught to do my work. I must send her away!" And away she would have been sent, irritated if not discouraged, and perhaps without knowing a place where to lay down her head in this strange country.</p>
<p>My friend did not act in this manner--she expressed no surprise at the attitude of the girl, only quietly said--"That 
 
<pb n="124" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=144"/>

is not the best way to peel your potatoes, Julia--just lay them on this plate, and I will show you how I like to have them done."</p>
<p>That Irish girl remained a servant in the same family for five years, proved herself not only capable of learning to work, but willing and most devoted in the service of her mistress, whom she regarded with a reverence little short of what a Catholic feels for his patron saint.<ref target="n009">* </ref> And thus, if with patience and kindness these poor Irish girls are treated and taught, may good and faithful help be obtained.</p>
<p>But unless ladies know how the work should be done and and are willing to teach their domestics, they should not employ the Irish when they first arrive.</p>
<p>Those who do employ and carefully instruct this class of persons, perform a most benevolent act to the usually destitute exiles, and also a good service to the community, by rendering those who would, if ignorant, become a burden and a nuisance, useful and often respectable members of society.</p>
<p>To educate a good domestic is one of the surest proofs that a lady is a good housekeeper.</p>
<p id="n009" size="smaller">*Julia married before she left her mistress, and the manner in which that kind lady treated her on the occasion, will show the character of both.</p>
<p size="smaller">It was late in the afternoon when Julia informed her mistress she must be married that same evening, because her intended husband was to start the next morning for the West.</p>
<p size="smaller">"I will send for the Bishop, then, and have some cake and wine ready for you, Julia," said the lady.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Thank you ma'am--but I suppose I must be married in the church," replied Julia, who was a good Catholic.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Then I will go and see you married," said the lady.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Will you, will you do that same," said Julia, with uplifted hands, her very pretty face sparkling with joy.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Yes--and you must invite the Bishop (Cheverus) to return home with you and partake of some cake and wine."</p>
<p size="smaller">At the marriage, when the bride was to make her promises of faithfulness, obedience, &amp;c. the Bishop enquired who would be her surety. In the catholic marriage service this sort of guaranty is required, like that of sponsors in baptism.</p>
<p size="smaller">Julia had not thought of this; but her mistress was there, she came forward, saying to the Bishop--"I will be surety for Julia--she has been in our family five years, and has proved herself an excellent domestic; I will answer for her faithfulness as a wife."</p>
<p size="smaller">"You are too kind!" exclaimed the Bishop; clasping his hands in thankfulness--and in his exhortation to the wedded pair, he reminded the bride how deeply she was indebted to her mistress who had taught and directed her in the right way, and exhorted her to prove herself worthy, by continued good conduct, of such a generous friend. And Julia has done this--she is settled at the West, her husband a respectable mechanic, and she a good wife.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">CHAPTER XV.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">A WORD TO MOTHERS.</hd>
<p align="center" size="smaller">"Train up a child in the way he should go, &amp;c."</p>
<p>To be known as a "good housekeeper"--in the comprehensive sense of the term,--should secure to a woman high respect; but if you are a <emph rend="italic">mother</emph> the crowning grace of your household management will be, that you have rightly trained the children committed to your care. Only bear in mind that the <emph rend="italic">first feeling</emph> of the infant is desire for food, the <emph rend="italic">first pleasure</emph> in life the gratification of appetite, and we shall see of what immense importance it is that the habit of regulating this instinct for food by the rules of reason and experience should be the first one formed in our children. Of course the foundation of this habit must be laid in the entire submission of the appetites of the young child to the reason and experience of its mother.</p>
<p>The kinds of food most proper for young children have been briefly noticed in this work. But the regulation of the quantity and times of taking food are of the utmost importance--this should be the mother's province. There is great danger that an infant, under three years of age, will be over-fed, if it be left to the discretion of the nurse. These persons, generally, have but one resource to stop the screaming of a child, whether it proceed from pain, or crossness, or, repletion (as it often does)--they give it something to eat--often that which is very injurious, to tempt the appetite; if it will only eat and stop crying, they do not care for the future inconvenience which this habit of indulgence may bring on the child and its mother.</p>
<p>Arrange as early as possible, the regular times of giving food to your children, according to their age and constitution. But remember that all temperaments are not alike. Some of the same age may require more food than others. One rule, however, will apply to all--never give a child food to amuse and keep it quiet when it is not hungry, or to reward it for being good. You may as rationally hope 
 
<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=146"/>

to extinguish a fire by pouring on oil, as to cure a peevish temper or curb a violent one by pampering the appetite for luxuries in diet; and all the traits of goodness you thus seek to foster, will in the end, prove as deceptive as the mirage of green fields and cool lakes to the traveller in the hot sands of the desert.</p>
<p>"My children have very peculiar constitutions," said an anxious mother--"They are so subject to fevers! If they take the least cold, or even have a fall they are sure to be attacked by fever." The family lived high, and those young children had a seat at the table and were helped to the best and richest of every thing. And their luncheon was cake and confectionary.</p>
<p>It was suggested to the mother that if she would adopt a different diet for those children, give them bread and milk morning and evening, and a plain dinner of bread, meat and vegetables, their liability to fevers would be much lessened.</p>
<p>"But my children do not love milk, and won't touch plain food"--was the answer, with a sort of triumphant smile, as though this cramming of her children with good things, till the blood of the poor little creatures was almost in a state of inflammation, was a high credit to her good housekeeping.</p>
<p>But do not err on the other hand; and for fear your child should be over-fed, allow it insufficient nourishment. There is not in our country, much reason to fear that such will be the case; the danger is, usually on the side of excess; still we must not forget that the effects from a system of slow starvation are, if not so suddenly fatal as that of repletion, more terrible because it reduces the intellectual as well as the physical nature of man, till he is hardly equal to the brutes.</p>
<p>In many parts of civilized and christian Europe, the mass of the people suffer from being over-worked and under-fed; few may die of absolute starvation, but their term of life is much shortened, and their moral and intellectual powers dwarfed or prostrated.</p>
<p>"Under an impoverished diet," says Dr Combe, "the moral and intellectual capacity is deteriorated as certainly as the bodily"--and he adverts to the work-house and charitable institution system of weak soups and low vegetable diet, 
 
<pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=147"/>

and to the known facts that children brought up on such fare are usually feeble, puny and diseased in body, and are at the best, but moderate in capacity.</p>
<p>The rational course seems to be, to feed infants, till about three years old chiefly with milk and mild farinaceous vegetable preparations--after that period, to proportion their solid food to the amount of exercise they are able to take. Children who play abroad in the open air, will require more hearty nourishment, more meat, than those who are kept confined in the house or school room. From the age of ten or twelve to sixteen or eighteen, when the growth is most rapid and the exercises (of boys especially) most violent, a sufficiency of plain nourishing food should be given; there is little danger of their taking too much, if it be of the right kind and properly cooked. But do not allow them to eat hot bread, or high seasoned meats and rich gravies, or use any kind of stimulating drinks.</p>
<p>I feel sure that every sensible mother will be willing to dispense with all alcoholic preparations in cookery. There is no doubt that many a fair promising boy who has ended his life an intemperate man, had the taste for liquor first excited and fostered by seeing it used daily as a necessary in the family, and often tasting it in the richest and most savory kinds of food. What christian mother will venture to teach by her own example, the love of this moral and mental poison to her young children?--If the family mode of living were "temperate in all things;" with suitable bathings and recreations, very little sickness would occur among children. And simple remedies would generally be found to relieve common attacks of disease. I shall give a few such remedies--those that are most easily to be obtained and used, chiefly for accidental injuries.</p>
<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FOR BURNS.</purpose>

Apply cotton wool dipped in <ingredient>oil</ingredient> as soon as possible, and keep it on till the fire is entirely out, which will usually take from two days to a week.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FOR A CUT.</purpose>

Wash off the blood in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and bind it up with a clean cotton bandage--if it inclines to bleed, put on scraped 
 
<pb n="128" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=gohk&#38;PageNum=148"/>

lint, after bringing the edges of the wound together as closely as possible, and bind it rather tight.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="medhealth">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FOR A BRUISE OR SPRAIN.</purpose>

Bathe the part in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> till you can get ready a decoction of wormwood. This is one of the best remedies for sprains and bruises. When the <ingredient>wormwood</ingredient> is fresh gathered, pound the leaves and wet them either with <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and bind them on the bruise--when the <ingredient>herb</ingredient> is dry, put it into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and let it warm by the fire a short time, then bathe the bruise and bind on the <ingredient>herb.</ingredient></p>
<p>Always keep cotton wool, scraped lint and wormwood on hand.</p>
<p>The best preventive of colds is to wash your children every day thoroughly in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> if they are strong enough to bear it--if not, add a little <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and rub the skin dry. This keeps the pores open. If they do take cold, give them a warm bath as soon as possible; if that is not convenient, bathe the feet and hands and wash the body all over in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> then give a cup of warm tea and cover the patient in bed.</p>
<p>If a sore throat follow, take a <implement>tumbler</implement> of <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> half and half, when going to bed; and rub the throat with a mixture of <ingredient>sweet or goose oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>spirits of turpentine,</ingredient> then wear a <implement>flannel</implement> around it.</p>
<p>For canker or sore mouth, steep <ingredient>blackberry leaves,</ingredient> sweeten with <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> sprinkle in a little <ingredient>burnt alum</ingredient> and wash the mouth often with this decoction.</p>
<p>The cookery for the sick requires great nicety and exactness, and should rarely be trusted to a common domestic. If you have a nurse constantly with your children, she may do this part of domestic duty well, otherwise, it must generally devolve on the mother.</p>

Upon one ounce of <ingredient>pearl barley,</ingredient> after it has been well washed in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> pour half a pint of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and then boil it for a few minutes; the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must then be strained off and thrown away; afterwards a quart of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> must be poured over the <ingredient>barley;</ingredient> and which should then be boiled down to one pint and a quarter, and strained off. The barley water thus made is clear and mucilaginous; and when mixed with an equal quantity of good <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and a small portion of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> is an excellent substitute for the mother's milk, when infants are, unfortunately, to be brought up by hand. Without milk, it is one of the best beverages for all acute diseases, and may have <ingredient>lemon juice,</ingredient> <ingredient>raspberry vinegar,</ingredient> <ingredient>apple tea,</ingredient> <ingredient>infusion of tamarinds,</ingredient> or any other acidulous substance that is agreeable to the palate of the patient, mixed with it.</p>

<p>Arrow-root thus prepared, may be used in the same manner as gruel. It is well adapted for the food of infants, because it is less liable to ferment than either gruel or barley water; and, for the same reason, it is the best fluid nourishment for those who are afflicted with diseases of indigestion. As it is very insipid, it requires either <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> or <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> or <ingredient>acids,</ingredient> to be mixed with it, whichever may suit the taste and the state of habit of the person for whom it is intended.

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">DECOCTION OF ICELAND LIVERWORT.</purpose>

An ounce of liverwort must be carefully freed from the moss, fragments of stalks, and particles of dirt, with which it is frequently mixed, by rubbing it between the hands in cold water. Then steep it, for two hours, in such a quantity of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as will completely cover it; after which it must be bruised, pounded, or cut, and the steeping continued for three or four days longer in a fresh quantity of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> which when the steeping is finished, must be strained off by pressure. The liverwort is then to be put into a quart of fresh <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and kept boiling until the fluid be reduced two-thirds, or to a pint and a quarter. When strained and allowed to cool, it forms a thick mucilage, free from any bitter taste; and may be rendered very palatable by the addition of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon juice;</ingredient> or by <ingredient>white wine,</ingredient> in those cases which permit the use of <ingredient>wine.</ingredient></p>
<p>This decoction of liverwort is an excellent demulcent nutriment, in consumption, dysentery and in convalesence from acute diseases, and particularly after the hooping cough, in which case the bitter need not be completely removed, as it tends to invigorate the digestive organs.</p>

<p>"Three dollars a week, Sir"--</p>
<p>"That is more than we have been accustomed to give. My family is not large; five in the parlor, only; and we have a house maid and boy," said Mr Manning.</p>
<p>"You may hire cooks cheaper, I suppose," said Madame Cook--"that is my price."</p>
<p>"I will give you two dollars and a half--though we never have paid over nine shillings."</p>
<p>"It is of no consequence to talk about it," said the woman, indignantly; and she swept out of the room with a lofty gesture that might have been a lesson to an insulted tragedy queen.</p>
<p>"Let me calculate"--thought Mr Manning, as he walked home. "I cannot expect to realize more than fifteen hundred clear, from the profits of my store--very likely it will be less. And now--$3 per week for a

cook--1,25 each for the boy and chambermaid; is five dollars and a half per week--Then the board $2 each per week; it will cost all that at the present rate of provisions--$6--making $11,50--or <emph rend="italic">five hundred and seventy-five</emph> per year for help--</p>
<p>"Then for rent, provisions, taxes, fuel, clothing, and all et ceteras for myself and family there remains $925--and my daughters want masters, and my wife must, for her health, go one journey in the year.</p>
<p>"There must be something radically wrong in the present fashions of our society. An educated man thinks it no shame to do the business of his profession, whatever it may be. I work hard in my store every day. But women, who have been educated, think it degrading to put their hands to any household employment, though that is all the task we assign to our females. A lady would be ashamed to be seen in her kitchen at work. Oh, how many are now sitting at ease in their pleasant parlors, while their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons are toiling like slaves! And, what is worse than toil, anxiously bearing a load of care, lest their income should not, with all their exertions, be sufficient to meet the expenses of their families.</p>
<p>"It cannot continue thus. If women who receive a fashionable education are thereby rendered incapable of performing their domestic duties--why, an educated man must remain single till he amasses a fortune--or must marry a <emph rend="italic">real help</emph> in order to have a <emph rend="italic">help</emph> meet for him.</p>
<p>"Yet it may be the folly and pride of us men, after all. We want the sole control of business and the whole credit of the pecuniary management of our households. We do not confide to our wives and daughters the embarrassments we suffer, or the need we have for their assistance--at least co-operation. I will now try what this confidence will produce. I will tell my wife and daughters precisely how my affairs stand."</p>
<p>The two elder Misses Manning (the youngest is at school) take each her turn in the kitchen every other week, and with the counsel of Mrs Manning and the help of the boy and a washerwoman once a week, every thing in the household department goes on like clock-work. They declare they will never be at the trouble of attempting to hire another cook. And what is still more agreeable, Mr Manning avers that their table was never before so well arranged or his daughters so gay and contented for a month together; and they say, that they never had so much time for their music and studies.</p>
<p>Early rising and active employment, for a few hours each day, are wonderful promoters of good health and cheerfulness; and leisure is never appreciated till it is earned by efforts to be useful, or enjoyed as relaxation from that industry which, in some way, is the duty of every rational being.</p>
