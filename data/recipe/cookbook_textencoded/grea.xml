<chapter class1="soups"><pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=19"/><hd align="center">CHAPTER I.<lb/>SOUPS AND BROTHS.</hd><p>To excel in making rich and palatable soup or broth, requires more judgment in the combination of its component parts than the variety of its flavors; and more care and pains-taking in conducting its process, than in selecting its ingredients. A rich and nutricious soup may be made with little or no expense; for in most cases it is real economy to convert the broth in which your meat or poultry has been boiled, into soup, especially if you have a young family. No dish is more wholesome and acceptable to children than well-seasoned soup. In the first place, (take no offence, madam!) it is highly necessary that your vessel should be perfectly clean; a little smut might pass incog. in a dish of roasted beef or broiled mackerel, but never in soup. Soup must be prepared in a perfectly neat kettle, the top should fit closely, or the most essential qualities of the soup will evaporate, as the juices of the meat are extracted. An open kettle will give the most delicious of its flavors to the surrounding<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=20"/> atmosphere, instead of condensing them within, and though you be ever so neat and fastidious, there will always be a collection of impurities which must be carried off by scum, especially if limestone water be used.</p><p>Place your kettle over a slow fire, where it will gradually warm for at least half an hour without boiling. During this process it will become penetrated and cleansed from the small clots of blood and other matters to be carried off by the scum, which will rise profusely, and which should be constantly taken off. When the half hour has expired, quicken the fire, let your soup boil, still continuing to remove the scum as it rises, until it is entirely clear; then place it where it will remain boiling slowly. It is decidedly erroneous to purpose extracting the most nutricious qualities of a fowl or beef-shank by hard boiling. They must, of course, escape with the steam. Never throw in salt until it has boiled. This will also clarify it, and it is proper to remove the scum as long as it presents itself to the surface. Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, those designed to be thickened must be a little thicker than rich cream. Thickened soups require more seasoning than clear. Bread crumbs are most excellent thickening, especially if toasted to a light brown, and it is both wholesome and savory. Rice may also be used in most compounds, or browned flour.</p><p>An invited dinner-party should invariably be presented with a plate of soup as a first course, and<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=21"/> no doubt it would be a judicious arrangement to have soup make its regular appearance at every day's dinner.</p><p size="smaller">OBSERVATION.--In preparing soups, always cut the pieces of meat you send in the <implement>tureen</implement> small enough to be eaten without introducing a knife and fork into the <implement>soup plate.</implement></p>
<recipe region="west" class1="soups"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CALIFORNIA SOUP.</purpose>
Take a <ingredient>leg of beef,</ingredient> weighing about ten pounds, and, after breaking the bones, put it into a <implement>soup-pot</implement> quite large enough to hold it, just cover it with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and heat it gradually till it nearly boils. This should take not less than an hour. Skim it attentively while any scum rises, then pour in a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and let it come to a boil again, skimming it till perfectly clear. Let it boil for eight or ten hours, and strain it through a <implement>hair sieve</implement> into a brown stone pan, and set it where it will soon become cool.</p><p>Next day remove every particle of fat from the top of it, and pour it through a fine sieve into a <implement>stewpan,</implement> taking care not to disturb the settling at the bottom of the stone pan. The <implement>stewpan</implement> should be of copper, well tinned. Put in an ounce of <ingredient>whole black pepper,</ingredient> and let it boil briskly on a quick fire, taking off the scum if any rises. When it is reduced to about a quart, set it over a gentler fire in a smaller vessel, till it is reduced to the consistence of a very thick syrup. Be very particular now that it does not burn, for a moment's carelessness may ruin the compound. Cool a little of it in<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=22"/> a spoon, and if it has the consistence of jelly it is done; if not, boil it till it has.</p><p>Put it away in small dry vessels, or, if you wish to preserve it more than six months, in bladders, such as are used for German sausages. If you prefer it in cakes, turn it into a shallow dish; and when it is cold, turn it out and weigh the cake, and divide it with a <implement>paste-cutter</implement> into half ounce or ounce pieces. Place them in a warm room, and turn them frequently till they are quite dry, which will take a week or ten days. When well hardened and kept in a dry place, they may be preserved for several years in any climate.</p></recipe>
<recipe region="west" class1="soups"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">BEEF BROTH.</purpose>
Desire the butcher to crack a <ingredient>shin of beef</ingredient> in two or three places, wash it very clean, and add to it any <ingredient>trimmings of meat, game, or poultry</ingredient> you may happen to have. Cover them in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> stir it up carefully from the bottom, and the moment it begins to simmer, skim it well. On the clearness of this broth depends the goodness of the soups, sauces, and gravies of which it is the basis. When it seems perfectly clear, add some <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to make the scum rise again, and then skim it until the surface of the broth is quite clear, and no more scum rises. Then put one common sized <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> a head of <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> two <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> and two <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> cover it close, and set it where it will simmer very gently for four or five hours. Strain it through a sieve into<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=23"/> a clean, dry, stone pan, and set it in the coolest place you can find.</p><p>This is a good foundation for all sorts of soups and sauces, brown or white.</p></recipe>

Turn the meat when it begins to stick to the bottom of the pan, and as soon as there is a brown glaze at the bottom, cover the meat with <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient> When it is coming to a boil, pour in half a pint of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> take off the scum, and then put in another half pint of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> skim it again, and repeat this process till no more scum rises.</p><p>Then set it to boil gently for four hours, strain it through a clean napkin, or a fine sieve, into a clean stone vessel, and let it remain till cold, when you must remove all the fat. When you pour it off, be careful not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the pan.</p><p>This is the basis of all gravy soups, which are called by the name of the vegetables used.</p></recipe>

They should stand without covers two or three days after they are made; they should be kept in a dry, cool place.</p><p><implement>Jelly-bags</implement> should be wrung out of boiling water just before they are used, and you should never press or squeeze fruit while straining it; always use a silver or a wooden spoon in preserving.</p><pb n="91" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=grea&#38;PageNum=97"/><p>It is better to put your preserves in small jars, as they are much more apt to spoil after being opened.

It will then be ready to pour off.</p><p><ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> should never be roasted too much; a light brown is sufficient; when it is suffered to become black, it looses its flavor, and is bitter and disagreeable.</p></recipe>
<recipe region="west" class1="beverages"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">MILK COFFEE.</purpose>
Boil a table-spoonful of <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in a pint of <ingredient>rich milk,</ingredient> a quarter of an hour; then put in a shaving or two of <ingredient>isinglass,</ingredient> and clear it; let it boil a few moments; then set it aside by the fire to settle.

<recipe region="west" class1="beverages"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE GREEN TEA.</purpose>
Scald your tea-pot, put in two tea-spoonsful of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> to a quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> let it stand a few minutes in the hot tea-pot before you fill up.

<recipe region="west" class1="beverages" alcoholic="yes"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">EGG-NOGG.</purpose>
Beat the whites of six <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> separately; add a tea-cupful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to the yolks, beat them well, then pour very slowly on a half pint of <ingredient>brandy;</ingredient> stir it all the time hard, or the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> will harden the <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> put a quart of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> on the fire in a saucepan, let it become quite hot, but do not let it boil; pour it over the mixture, beat it all well together; then add the <ingredient>whites</ingredient>--be sure to have them very stiff, or your nogg will not be good--beat it all again, then grate a <ingredient>nutmeg</ingredient> over the top. <variation>If you like it cold, add <ingredient>cold milk,</ingredient> instead of warming it.</variation></p></recipe>
