<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>
FOOD is the most important of our wants; we cannot exist without it. The man who does not use his brain to select and prepare his food, is not above the brutes that take it in its raw state. It is to the physique what education is to the mind, coarse or refined. Good and well-prepared food beautifies the physique the same as a good and well-directed education beautifies the mind. A cook-book is like a book on chemistry, it cannot be used to any advantage if theory is not blended with practice. It must also be written according to the natural products and climate of the country in which it is to be used, and with a perfect knowledge of the properties of the different articles of food and condiments.
</p>
<p>
Like many other books, it is not the size that makes it practical; we could have made this one twice as large as it is, without having added a single receipt to it, by only having given separate ones for pieces of meat, birds, fishes, etc., that are of the
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=6"/>
same kind and prepared alike. All cook-books written by mere compilers, besides giving the same receipt several times, recommend the most absurd mixtures as being the best and of the "latest French style."
</p>
<p>
Although cookery has made more progress within two or three years, in this country as well as in Europe, than it had since 1830, and although all our receipts are complete, practical, wholesome, and in accordance with progress, still they are simple. Our aim has been to enable every housekeeper and professional cook, no matter how inexperienced they may be, to prepare any kind of food in the best and most wholesome way, with economy, celerity, and taste; and also to serve a dinner in as orderly a manner as any steward can do.
</p>
<p>
We did not intend to make a book, such as that of CAR&#200;ME, which cannot be used at all except by cooks of very wealthy families, and with which one cannot make a dinner costing less than twenty dollars a head. Such a book is to housekeepers or plain cooks what a Latin dictionary is to a person of merely elementary education.
</p>
<p>
If we give so many different ways of preparing the same article of food, it is not with a view to complicate cookery, but people's taste is in food as in dress, differing not only in the selection of colors, but also in shape; therefore, by our variety of dishes and our different styles of decorating them; by the ease
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=7"/>
that they can be prepared in the cheapest as well as in the most costly way, we think we have met all wants and all tastes. The wealthy, as well as those in limited circumstances, can use our receipts with the same advantage.
</p>
<p>
Our division of cookery and the system of arranging 
<emph rend="italic">bills of fare,</emph> contained in these pages, solve that great and perplexing question, especially for ladies, how to arrange a bill of fare for every season, to suit any number of guests, at a greater or less expense, as they may desire. Every one knows that money alone cannot make good dishes; however good the raw materials may be, they require proper preparations before being palatable and wholesome.
</p>
<hd align="center" size="larger">TO HOUSEKEEPERS AND COOKS.</hd>
<p>
A cook-book cannot be used like a dictionary; a receipt is like a rule of grammar: to comprehend it thoroughly, it is indispensable to understand others. The author, therefore, earnestly recommends to his readers to begin by perusing carefully the directions, etc., at the beginning of the book, and also the explanations given on and heading the different articles of food, before attempting the preparation of a dish for the first time. They will thus soon be able to prepare any dish by merely reading the receipt. If all the explanations necessary were given at every receipt, this work would have filled more than ten volumes like the present.
</p>
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=8"/>
<p>
We are aware that the study of cookery is as uninviting and dry as the study of grammar at first; so is the study of every science and even art; but it becomes comparatively easy and interesting after a while. Mere flourish in a receipt would have the same effect as in a rule of grammar.
</p>
<hd align="center" size="larger">TO COOKS.</hd>
<p>
We think the following friendly recommendations will not be out of place here. They are in the interest of both the housekeeper and the cook:
</p>
<p>
Make use of every thing good.
</p>
<p>
Waste nothing, however little it may be.
</p>
<p>
Have no prejudices.
</p>
<p>
Be careful, clean, and punctual.
</p>
<p>
Always bear in mind that routine is the greatest enemy of progress, and that you have agreed to faithfully perform your daily duties for a certain consideration.

<chapter class1="foodandnonfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">COOKING.</hd>
<p>
THE science and art of cooking may be divided into ten principal parts; the rest is all fancy. These ten parts are: BAKING, BOILING, BROILING, FRYING, MIXING, ROASTING, SAUT&#201;ING, SEASONING, SIMMERING, and STEWING.
</p>
<p>
Tasting is an adjunct to all.
</p>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Baking.</emph>--In baking, see that the furnace or oven be properly heated; some dishes require more heat than others. Look at the object in process of baking from time to time, and especially at the beginning, turn it round if necessary, in case it be heated more on one side than on the other, to prevent burning.
</p>
<p>
In baking meat and fish, besides keeping the bottom of the pan covered with broth or water, place a piece of buttered paper over the object in the pan; it not only prevents it from burning, but acts as a self-basting operation, and keeps the top moist and juicy.
</p>
<p>
If the top of cakes bake faster than the rest, place a piece of paper on it.
</p>
<p>
In most of our receipts, we give the degree of heat necessary to bake the different objects; it will, no doubt, be found valuable information.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Boiling.</emph>--This is the most abused branch in cooking; we know that many good-meaning housewives and even
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=12"/>
professional cooks boil things that ought to be prepared otherwise, with a view to economy; but a great many do it through laziness. Boiling requires as much care as any other branch, but they do not think so, and therefore indulge in it.
</p>
<p>
Another abuse is to boil fast instead of slowly. Set a small ocean of water on a brisk fire and boil something in it as fast as you can, you make much steam but do not cook faster; the degree of heat being the same as if you were boiling slowly.
</p>
<p>
If the object you boil, and especially boil fast, contains any flavor, you evaporate it, and cannot bring it back.
</p>
<p>
Many things are spoiled or partly destroyed by boiling, such as meat, coffee, etc.
</p>
<p>
Water that has been boiled is inferior for cooking purposes, its gases and alkali being evaporated.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Broiling.</emph>--Whatever you broil, grease the bars of the gridiron first.
</p>
<p>
Broiling and roasting is the same thing; the object in process of cooking by either must be exposed to the heat on one side, and the other side to the air.
</p>
<p>
Bear in mind that no one can broil or roast in an oven, whatever be its construction, its process of heating, or its kind of heat. An object cooked in an oven is baked.
</p>
<p>
It is better to broil before than over the fire. In broiling before the fire, all the juice can be saved.
</p>
<p>
In broiling by gas, there is a great advantage. The meat is placed under the heat, and as the heat draws the juice of the meat, the consequence is, that the juice being attracted upward, it is retained in the meat.
</p>
<p>
A gas broiler is a square, flat drum, perforated on one side and placed over a frame.
</p>
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=13"/>
<p>
Broiling on live coals or on cinders without a gridiron is certainly not better than with one, as believed by many; on the contrary, besides not being very clean, it burns or chars part of the meat.
</p>
<p>
That belief comes from the fact that when they partook of meat prepared that way, it was with a sauce that generally accompanies hunters, fishermen, etc., --<emph rend="italic">hunger</emph>--the most savory of all savory sauces.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Frying.</emph>--That part of cooking is not as difficult as it is generally believed, and properly fried objects are good and do not taste greasy.
</p>
<p>
To fry requires care, and nothing fried will taste greasy if it has been dropped in fat properly heated and in enough of it to immerse the object.
</p>
<p>
When an object tastes greasy, it is not because it has been fried in grease, but because there was not enough of it, or because it was not properly heated; for, if heated enough it closes the pores of the object and carbonizes the exterior, so that it cannot absorb any.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Directions for Frying.</emph>--Prepare what you intend to fry according to the directions given in the different receipts.
</p>
<p>
Have fat, lard, or oil in a pan, enough to immerse the object or objects intended to be fried.
</p>
<p>
When the fat is hot enough (see below), place the object in a kind of wire basket made for that purpose, which drop in the fat and take off when the object is fried. It is handy, and there is no danger of breaking the object in taking it off.
</p>
<p>
There are objects that require to be stirred or turned over while frying.
</p>
<p>
Every time you fry any thing, take the fat from the fire, let it stand in a cool place for about five minutes,
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=14"/>
then turn it gently into a stone jar or pot through a strainer; let cool and put away. In turning the fat, lard, or oil into the jar, pour so that the dregs will be kept in the pan.
</p>
<p>
To ascertain with accuracy when the fat, lard, or oil is hot enough to lay the things in the pan, dip a fork in cold water, the prongs only, so as to retain but one or two drops of water, which drops you let fall in the fat, and if it crackles, it is hot enough.
</p>
<p>
Another way is, when jets of smoke come out of the fat.
</p>
<p>
There are objects that require more heat than others, some that are more sightly when brown, and others when of a pale-yellow hue.
</p>
<p>
If the object is desired brown, leave the pan on a brisk fire while it is frying; if otherwise, remove it to a slow or less brisk fire.
</p>
<p>
Fat is not like water, which, no matter how fast you boil it, you cannot augment the degree of heat, while you can that of fat. If water, by boiling it fast, could be heated as much as fat, it would be used to fry in its stead, being cheaper.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Mixing.</emph>--In mixing, pay due attention to the quantities we give in the receipts; but as everybody has not the same taste, it is very easy to augment or diminish the quantity of salt, pepper, sugar, butter, etc., so as to suit one's own taste.
</p>
<p>
When the quantity is left to the judgment or taste of the cook, that is, when the expression 
<emph rend="italic">about so much</emph> is made use of, it is not necessary then to have the exact quantity; a little more or a little less cannot spoil or partly destroy the dish.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Roasting.</emph>--When an object is placed on the spit according
<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=15"/>
to directions, remember that it cannot be basted too often.
</p>
<p>
The time necessary for roasting a piece of meat or any thing else, depends as much upon the fire as upon the nature of the meat. Meat especially requires to be placed very near the fire at first, and then put back by degrees.
</p>
<p>
There is nearly as much difference between roasted and baked meat as there is between broiled and fried meat.
</p>
<p>
It is generally admitted here, that English roast-beef is so superior to American roast-beef that it cannot be compared to it. It is not in the quality of the meat that the difference lies, but in the process of cooking.
</p>
<p>
Meat cannot be roasted in an oven, be it in an ordinary or in a patented one.
</p>
<p>
That peculiar flavor in roasted meat is produced by the air coming constantly in contact with the heated meat while revolving on the spit.
</p>
<p>
Cold roasted meat, when desired to be served warm, is enveloped in buttered paper and placed on the spit just long enough to warm it.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Saut&#233;ing.</emph>--There is no word, that we know, in the English language, corresponding to the French word 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;.</emph> It differs from frying in this: that to fry any object requires <ingredient>fat</ingredient> enough to immerse that object; while to 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;</emph> it, requires just enough to prevent it from scorching.
</p>
<p>
Vegetables, omelets, etc., are 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;d,</emph> and not fried.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Meat</ingredient> or <ingredient>fish</ingredient> cooked in a frying-pan with a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> is 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;d,</emph> and not fried; but the term fried is most generally used, the other being only known to practitioners.
</p>
<p>
To 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;</emph> requires a brisk fire; the quicker an object is cooked by 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;ing</emph> the better.
</p>
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=16"/>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Seasoning.</emph>--This is the most difficult part in the science of cooking. To season is not difficult, but to season properly is quite another thing.
</p>
<p>
It is not only necessary to know well how to stew or roast a peace of meat or any thing else, but to know how to season it, to be able to judge what quantity and what kind of spices can be used to season such or such a dish, to what extent all the spices used agree together, and what taste and flavor they will give to the object with which they are cooked; for, if not properly used, they may just as likely destroy the taste and flavor of the object as improve it.
</p>
<p>
Some dishes require high and much seasoning, others just the contrary. With a good fire and a good spit, it is not necessary to be a thorough cook to roast a piece well, but the cook is indispensable to mix the gravy or sauce with the proper seasonings.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Simmering.</emph>--Simmering differs from boiling only in the amount of heat allowed under the boiler, kettle, or pan. To simmer, is to boil as gently and slowly as possible.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Stewing.</emph>--To stew properly it is necessary to have a moderate fire and as even as possible. A brisk fire would cause much steam to evaporate, which steam is the flavor of the object stewed.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Tasting.</emph>--This is the most difficult, and at the same time the most delicate, part of seasoning; it is by tasting that we ascertain if we have seasoned properly.
</p>
<p>
In this only two of the senses are engaged, and one of those much more than the other.
</p>
<p>
A person may have good feeling, hearing, and sight, and for all that would not be fit for preparing the simplest dish; the senses of smelling and tasting are the ones most required, and without which no one can cook properly.
</p>
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=17"/>
<p>
For these reasons we will take the liberty to recommend to housekeepers, when they have new cooks, to instruct them on their taste, and always let them know when they have seasoned too much or too little. To the cooks we will say, do not season according to your own taste, if the persons for whom you cook do not like it.
</p>
<p>
If the housekeeper would give his or her candid and frank opinion of the dishes to the cook, and if the latter be not stubborn, the best results might be obtained and both would be benefited by it. That ought to be done every day while making the bill of fare.
</p>
<p>
To taste a sauce, as well as to know if a thing is good to eat, we cannot trust either our eyes, fingers, or ears; we then have recourse, first to our smelling, and then to our tasting: so do most animals.
</p>
<p>
We always commence by smelling, and when that sense is satisfied as far as it is concerned, we then apply our tasting qualities; and if that last one is, in its turn, satisfied also, we proceed, that is, we masticate, if mastication is necessary, and then swallow.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">DIRECTIONS, EXPLANATIONS, ETC.</hd>
<section>
<hd align="center">ANISE.</hd>
<p>
ANISE comes from Egypt, and is used as a spice.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">APRICOT.</hd>
<p>
This is a native of Armenia. It is served like plums and peaches; in salad, compote, etc.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">BACON.</hd>
<p>
Never use smoked bacon or ham, except when especially directed. The smoky taste would spoil the dish.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">BAIN-MARIE.</hd>
<p>
A bain-marie is a large vessel of hot or boiling water, in which saucepans, kettles, moulds, etc., are placed to prepare or warm food. It is also used to keep any kind of food warm, when something is ready to serve, and the time has not come; the utensil containing it is placed in hot water, and it not only keeps it warm, but there is almost no evaporation while in it. It does not boil away either.
</p>
<p>
There are things that are much more delicate when prepared or warmed in hot water.
</p>
<p>
One utensil made for that purpose, and of brass, with compartments, is more handy, but a large saucepan may be used in its stead.
</p>
<p>
When any thing is in the bain-marie, the water should
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=19"/>
not be allowed to boil fast enough either to upset the pans or get into them.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">BAKE-PANS.</hd>
<p>
A bake-pan for baking meat, fish, or any other object that requires liquor of any kind, must have borders in order to hold that liquor; but a bake-pan for cakes or any other object that does not require any liquor, or that does not turn liquid in baking, is better without borders--that is, a simple piece of sheet iron of a size to go easily in the oven.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">BAY-LEAF.</hd>
<p>
This is known also under its French name 
<emph rend="italic">laurier.</emph>
</p>
<p>
It is used as a <ingredient>spice;</ingredient> it is exceedingly cheap and is excellent to flavor sauces, <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> etc.
</p>
<p>
It comes especially from Italy, where it is used to pack <ingredient>figs,</ingredient> <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and different <ingredient>fruits.</ingredient>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">BEETS.</hd>
<p>
The red beet is much used to decorate different dishes.
</p>
<p>
It is boiled, then pickled, cut in fancy shapes, either with a knife or with paste-cutters, and tastefully placed on or around the object it is used to decorate.
</p>
<p>
It is served as a 
<emph rend="italic">hors-d'&#x153;uvre,</emph> pickled, and cut in slices.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To boil.</emph>--Set it on a good fire in a pan, covered with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and boil gently till done.
</p>
<p>
The <ingredient>beet</ingredient> must not be touched at all with any thing rough, for if the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> or root is cut or broken, all the color goes away in boiling, it is not fit to decorate, and loses much of its quality.
</p>
<p>

Braising, in cookery, means to cook any thing with fire under and upon the pan, kettle, or other utensil.

<hd align="center">DRINKING.</hd>
<p>
When weary, or cold, or warm, or exhausted, we drink in preference to eating, because we feel the effect instantaneously; while after eating even the most substantial food, we do not feel the effect for some time.
</p>
<p>
When exhausted and when immediate relief is necessary, the best drinks are broth, chocolate, milk, or water sweetened with sugar. It is more than a mistake to drink wines or liquors at such a time; it is really committing slow suicide.
</p>
<p>
When only thirsty, without exhaustion, we ought to drink cold water with a teaspoon. When thirsty and heated, the first thing to do is to dip the hands in cold water deep enough just to cover the wrists; then dip a towel in the water, lay it on the forehead, and then drink cold water with a teaspoon.
</p>
<p>
A few drops of vinegar or lemon-juice may be added to the water. If exceedingly hot, keep your hands in cold water and the towel on your forehead at least one minute before drinking.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">HOT WEATHER.</hd>
<p>
A remark or two on eating and drinking in hot weather are always in season. Green vegetables, properly cooked, are certainly healthful in warm weather; but it is a mistake to think that meat should be excluded from summer diet. The hotter the weather, the more the system wastes, and therefore the more we must supply.
</p>
<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=24"/>
<p>
In order to keep the body in a healthful condition, meat ought to be eaten at least once a day in summer-time. It would be well to vary this programme by taking one meal of fish on every other day.
</p>
<p>
Fat should be disused as much as possible. A very little good butter with your fresh radishes at breakfast is as much fat as is necessary.
</p>

<hd align="center">FOOD.</hd>
<p>
Nature has provided man with a mind, in order that he should study what kind of food suits his constitution; he who does not do it, is not above the lower animals.
</p>
<p>
"Good things have been made by the Creator for good people, flowers have certainly not been made for brutes, either quadruped or biped."--<emph rend="italic">Jefferson.</emph>
</p>
<p>
"It is from good things that, in a human point of view, we derive the strength necessary to our limbs, let us partake of the same and be thankful."--<emph rend="italic">Rev.--Chadband.</emph>
</p>
<p>
Have your food selected and prepared according to constitution, occupation, climate, age, and sex.
</p>
<p>
Waste in females is greater than in males.
</p>
<p>
Animals, generally, are very careful in selecting their food.
</p>
<p>
A temporary bloatedness may be obtained, especially with the young, by eating much farinaceous food, such as pancakes, etc., but it does not last, and is sure to bring on disease or sickness, or both.
</p>
<p>
Man is omnivorous, and must be fed accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Extreme leanness comes from want of proper food, either in youth or old age.

<p>
It is not the amount that is eaten which nourishes, but the amount that is digested; an excess of food is as bad as a lack of it.
</p>
<p>
Good and well-baked bread is nutritious and healthful, while unbaked bread is heavy and difficult of digestion.
</p>
<p>
Take at least half an hour's rest after a hearty meal, for mind and stomach cannot work at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Never eat when angry, or tired, or when heated; but be as cool and as gay as possible, for food being exposed to a heat of about 100 degrees Fahr, in the stomach, would ferment instead of digesting.
</p>
<p>
Take a hearty but by no means heavy dinner.
</p>
<p>
Eat slowly, at regular hours, and masticate well, but do not bolt your food, or eat any thing that does not taste good.
</p>
<p>
Drink slowly, moderately, and always taste before swallowing.
</p>
<p>
Vary your food as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
Always have at least one dish of vegetables for dinner, besides meat, and also ripe fruit.
</p>
<p>
See that every thing you eat or drink is of a good quality, wholesome and properly prepared.

There is not a word so much misused in cooking as the word economy.
</p>
<p>
Prejudice comes for a large share in the use of it.
</p>
<p>
How many things are thrown away, or wasted by mere prejudice or ignorance!
</p>
<p>
It is often from economy that a woman washes meat, because some part of it does not look clean. Instead of washing it, do not buy it; or, if bought, cut off a thin slice and throw it away: it is more economical than washing the whole piece, which you partly destroy by the process.
</p>

<p>
It is with a view to economy, that an old, bad custom prevails of boiling coffee. What an economy of sending the best part of the coffee (the aroma) to the attic, and the rest to the dining-room. A bad drink can be made cheaper with many things than with coffee.

Tea is also boiled with an eye to economy.

<hd align="center">EGG-BEATER.</hd>
<p>
We have tried five different kinds in Boston, before a large audience and on the demand of an inventor of one, but none could beat eggs as well as a common hand-beater. The whites of the eggs could not be raised with any of the others much more than half as much as with the common one; and besides, could not be beaten stiff.
</p>
<p>
Many persons do not succeed in making cakes of different preparations in which whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth are used, because the eggs are not properly beaten.
</p>
<p>
Any tinsmith can make an egg-beater. It is generally made with tin-wire, but may be made with brass-wire.

</p>
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=27"/>
<p>
It is by ignorance or disease that man abuses wine or any other liquor.
</p>
<p>
It is by ignorance or prejudice that many eschew the best and most healthful of condiments, such as garlics, onions, etc. They dislike them on account of their pungent taste when raw, not knowing that when cooked it is all evaporated. Their pungent taste comes from the volatile oil they contain, and which evaporates in cooking; it cannot be retained, but their sugar is retained, and gives such a good flavor to gravies and sauces.

<hd align="center">KITCHEN UTENSILS.</hd>
<p>
Gastronomists use, in preference to any thing else, crockery or earthen pans; or, for want of these, block-tin pans.
</p>
<p>
Copper is, in the end, the cheapest of all; but American cooks do not like them because they require too much care and must be examined every day; to prevent any accident, it is necessary to keep the inside properly lined.
</p>
<p>
Many indispositions are caused by food prepared in copper not properly lined; even food allowed to cool in a well-lined pan would be dangerous.
</p>
<p>
Pans lined with porcelain are excellent, but the trouble with them is, that they crack, and after that cannot be
<pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=30"/>
cleaned; something will always remain between the lining and the iron, and spoil every thing cooked in them.

Never buy lard ready made if you can help it, but take hog's fat, the part enveloping the kidneys, or leaf lard, and chop it fine, put it in a cast-iron or crockery kettle with a bay-leaf and a stalk of thyme to every two pounds of fat; set on a moderate fire, and as soon as it begins to melt, take the melted part out with a ladle, and put it in a stone jar or pot; be careful not to take any pieces of fat not yet melted. Continue that process till it is all melted.

<p>
The dry or hard part that remains at the bottom of the kettle when done is no good.
</p>
<p>
Lard made thus is as white as snow, and may be kept a long time.

Take beef suet, the part around the kidneys, or any kind of fat, raw or cooked; remove as much as possible fibres, nerves, thin skin, or bones; chop it fine, put it in a cast-iron or crockery kettle; add to it the fat you may have skimmed from the top of broth, sauces or, gravies. Set the pan on a moderate fire; boil gently for about fifteen minutes, skim it well during the process; take from the fire, let it stand about five minutes, and then strain.
</p>
<p>
Put it in a stone jar or pot, and keep it in a dry and cool place. Cover the jar when perfectly cold.
</p>
<p>
It is as good as lard and more handy; it does not fly over the pan like lard.

All pork-butchers sell salt pork for larding. Cut it in slices and then by cutting the slices across it makes square strips or fillets.

The strips must be of a proper size to be easily inserted into the larding-needle, and are about two inches and a half long.

When the needle is run half way through the meat, insert the salt pork into it, pull the needle off and leave the salt pork inside of the meat, both ends of it sticking out.
</p>
<p>
If it were running through, that is, if the salt pork were pulled off with the needle, most likely the strips are too small; then pull slowly, and when the salt pork is far enough into the meat, press on it with the finger and pull the needle, it will then stay in its proper place. It is better to cut a few strips first and try if they are of a proper size.

<p>
If, in pulling off the needle, the salt pork does not enter the meat, the strips are too large.

<p>
Osmazome is found in beef, mutton, full-grown domestic fowls, venison, and game; in the latter, when the bird or animal is adult.
</p>
<p>
In meat soup, the osmazome is the soluble part of the meat that dissolves in boiling, and makes nutritious broth.
</p>
<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=37"/>
<p>
In broiled or roasted pieces, it is that part which makes a kind of brown crust on the surface of the meat, and also the brownish part of the gravy.
</p>
<p>
Chicken, lamb, sucking-pig, veal, etc., do not contain any osmazome.

Hang in the shade, under a shed, or in a garret, and in a clean and dry place, some small bunches of parsley, chervil, celery, etc., the roots upward; leave them thus till perfectly dry, then place them in your spice-box for winter use.
</p>
<p>
The best time for drying them is at the end of October or the beginning of November; dig them up in fine and dry weather, so as to have them clean without washing.
</p>

Soak in cold water half an hour before using.

<p>
This is black pepper decorticated.

Put peppercorns in a bowl, cover with cold water, and leave thus till the skin is tender; then drain. Take the skin off, let it dry, grind it; place with your other spices, and use where directed. It takes many days for the skin to become tender.

<section>
<hd align="center">QUALITY OF MEAT, FISH, VEGETABLES, FRUIT, ETC.</hd>
<p>
The quality of meat depends entirely on the quality of food with which the animal has been fed.
</p>
<p>
For fish, the taste or quality is according to the kind of water in which they have lived; fish from a muddy pond smell of mud, while fish from a clear brook are delicious.
</p>
<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=38"/>
<p>
The same difference exists in vegetables and fruit; their quality is according to the quality or nature of the ground in which they have been grown.

<hd align="center">PASTRY-BAG.</hd>
<p>
A bag for pastry is made with thick, strong linen; of a conical shape, about one foot long, eight inches broad at one end when spread on a flat surface, and which makes about sixteen inches in circumference, and only one inch and a quarter at the other end, and in which latter end a tin tube is placed, so that the smaller end of the tin tube will come out of the smaller end of the bag. Putting then some mixture into the bag and by pressing from the upper end downward, the mixture will come out of the tin tube.

<hd align="center">RAW MATERIALS.</hd>
<p>
If American cookery is inferior to any other generally, it is not on account of a want of the first two requisites--raw materials and money to buy them; so there is no excuse for it, both are given to the cooks.

<p>
Here, where markets rival the best markets of Europe and even surpass them in abundance, it is really a pity to live as many do live.

Shallots come from Syria. Shallot is stronger than garlic and onion; a real Tartar sauce cannot be made without shallot. The small, green onion is a good substitute for it.

</p>
<illustration><description>An illustration of Five Skewers of Different Shapes and Sizes.</description>

as a decoration. They are removed just before carving.
</p>
<p>
The use of them is explained in the different receipts. They may be different from those seen in the cuts.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">SPICES.</hd>
<p>
The cooks of this country generally have a queer idea of what they call French cookery and French spices.
</p>
<p>
Some honestly believe that to make a French dish a great deal of pepper and other strong seasonings must be put in.
</p>
<p>
Many other persons, who have not been in Europe, really believe also, that French cookery is what is called highly-seasoned. There never was a greater mistake.
</p>
<p>
If French cooks use several kinds of spices, and may-be more than American cooks, they are not the same; or if some are the same, such as pepper, they use them in much smaller proportions.
</p>
<p>
They generally use thyme, parsley, bay-leaf, chervil, tarragon, etc., which are aromatic; but never use (in this climate) ginger, curry, cayenne pepper, pimento, catsups, variegated colored pickles made with pyroligneous acids, etc., and which are very exciting and irritating.
</p>
<p>
Some of our readers may naturally ask: How is it that French cookery is believed by many to be the contrary of what it really is?
</p>
<p>
Because every eating-house, of no matter what size, pretends to be a first-rate one or a fashionable one--and to be first-rate or fashionable must, as a matter of course, have French cooks, or at least cook French dishes.
</p>
<p>
You enter the place, ask for a French dish; or, ask if you can have such a dish, 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la Fran&#231;aise?</emph>
</p>
<p>
You are politely and emphatically answered in the affirmative;
<pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=41"/>
and very often the polite waiter says that a French cook presides in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Result!--the cook, be he from the Green Isle or of African descent, receiving the order to prepare a French dish, puts a handful of <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> in the already too much peppered, old-fashioned prepared dish, and sends it to the confident customer as a genuine French dish.
</p>
<p>
Said customer never asks a second time for a French dish, and pronounces French cookery to be--abominable!

<hd align="center">STIRRING.</hd>
<p>
Never use any spoon but a wooden one to stir any thing on the fire or in a warm state.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">STRAINING.</hd>
<p>
To strain, is to pass a sauce or any thing else through a sieve, a strainer, or a piece of cloth, in order to have it freed from particles of every kind.
</p>
<p>
Broth is strained to make soup, so as to remove the small pieces of bones that may be in it, etc.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">SUGAR.</hd>
<p>
Sugar plays a very important part in cooking. It is added to cereals, vegetables, and fruit, many of which would almost be unpalatable without it, and which are rendered not only palatable but wholesome by its action.
</p>
<p>
It is the sugar of the carrot and that of the onion, or of the garlic, that gives such a peculiar and delicious flavor to gravies and sauces, to beef 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode, fricandeau,</emph> etc.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Pulverized.</emph>--When pulverized or powdered sugar can be had pure, it saves the trouble to do it; but often there are foreign matters in it and therefore it is better to make it; you know then what you have.
</p>
<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=42"/>
<p>
Break loaf sugar> into small lumps, pound it and sift it. With a fine sieve, you can make it as fine as you please.
</p>
<p>
It was not used in Europe until about the middle of the seventeenth century.
</p>
<p>
For the cooking of sugar, see PRESERVES.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">TARRAGON.</hd>
<p>
The French name of tarragon is 
<emph rend="italic">estragon.</emph> It is excellent in vinegar and in many fish sauces. It is aromatic, sudorific, and stomachic, and grows very well in this country. It grows at least twice as large here as in Europe.

<section>
<hd align="center">TIN TUBES.</hd>
<p>
These tubes are put in the pastry-bag, at the smaller end of it, to make 
<emph rend="italic">meringues,</emph> ladies' fingers, etc.; they are of tin, and can be made by any tinsmith.
</p>
<p>
They have the shape of a trapezoid or frustum. Two are enough for any purpose.
</p>
<p>
No. 1. One inch and a half long; one inch and three-eighths in diameter at one end, and nine-sixteenths of an inch at the other end.
</p>

<section>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">TRUFFLES.</hd>
<p>
Truffles are found in Europe and Africa, where they were first discovered.
</p>
<p>
The truffle is neither an animal nor a vegetable, although it has been classified among the fungi, which has root, and the truffle has neither root nor stem.
</p>
<p>
The truffle is used for stuffing and flavoring only otherwise it is not of much value. On account of their
<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=43"/>
<gap extent="two page"/>.
</p>
<p>
Cold nights during the ripening of the fruit make the wine more acid, not ripening so perfectly.
</p>
<p>
Wine is a healthy drink, and many invalids would recover much quicker by a judicious use of it.
</p>
<p>
Different wines are used in cooking, and we give the names of the best ones in the different receipts.
</p>
<p>
A little vinegar may be used as a substitute for wine,
<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=45"/>
but it is very inferior, and in many dishes it cannot be used at all.
</p>
<p>
A few dollars spent during the year in wine for cooking purposes, makes much better and more wholesome dishes.
</p>
<p>
White wine contains little tannin; it retains nitrogenous matters, and is free from essential oils; hence the superior flavor and quality of brandy made with white wines.
</p>
<p>
It is more aperient and less nutritive than red wine.
</p>
<p>
Essential oils pass in red wine while it is fermenting.
</p>
<p>
Wine and sugar with certain fruits are excellent, and are known to neutralize the crudity of the fruit, such as straw-berries, pears, peaches, currants, etc.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading">COFFEE.</purpose> It is simple to make <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient> Of course, when properly made, with good <ingredient>berries,</ingredient> the liquor is good.
</p>
<p>
When good roasted <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> can be bought, it saves the trouble of roasting it, and is, or rather ought to be, cheaper than it can be done in a family.
</p>
<p>
If coffee is roasted a long time before being used it loses much of its aroma, therefore a family ought not to roast more than it can use in about a week, while twenty or twenty-five pounds can be roasted at one time and by one person.
</p>
<p>
Three or four different kinds, roasted separately, and properly mixed, make better coffee than one kind alone.
</p>
<p>
A good proportion is: to one pound of <ingredient>Java</ingredient> add about four ounces of <ingredient>Mocha,</ingredient> and four ounces of one or two other kinds.
</p>
<p>
Good <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> as well as <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> is said to possess exhilarating properties.

<pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=50"/>
<p>
Its use was not known in Europe before 1650. Neither was the use of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient> and <ingredient>brandy.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Good <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> cannot be made but by leaching.
</p>
<p>
The easiest utensil is what is called a filter, or coffee-pot, or biggin, according to locality, with a top to diffuse the <ingredient>water.</ingredient>
</p>
<illustration><description>An illustration of Two Coffee Pots.</description>
</illustration>
<p>
The coffee-pot called "the French balance" makes the best-flavored <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> but it is an expensive one.
</p>
<illustration><description>An illustration of a French Balance.</description>
</illustration>
<p>
There are several good filters, but the great majority of the people find them too complicated for daily use.
</p>
<p>
The bottom of the filter should be of silvered brass-gauze instead of perforated tin, as it is generally.
</p>
<p>
Gauze-holes being much smaller than those of perforated tin, the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> can be ground much finer, and therefore,
<pb n="49" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=51"/>
all the strength and aroma can be had; while if ground coarse, it is utterly impossible.
</p>
<p>
Good <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> cannot be made in a utensil often but wrongly called a 
<emph rend="italic">coffee-pot,</emph> which is nothing but a pot, and something like a tea-pot.
</p>
<p>
With such a utensil, the grounds must be boiled; and as no liquor can be boiled without allowing the steam to escape (the steam made by boiling <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> being its aroma), therefore the best part of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is evaporated before it is served.
</p>
<p>
Never grind your <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> until ready to make it.
</p>
<p>
No matter how air-tight you keep it, the aroma evaporates or is absorbed.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> can be ground and made as soon as cool; but it is better to let it stand for about twenty-four hours after being roasted.
</p>
<p>
If kept as air-tight as possible in a tin-box, it will keep very well for about a week.
</p>
<p>
Never buy ground <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> except when you cannot help it.
</p>
<p>
By taking a pinch of ground <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> and rolling it between wetted fingers, it will remain in grains, if pure; and will form in a ball if foreign matters are mixed with it.
</p>
<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO ROAST.</purpose> In roasting, good <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> swells about thirty-three per cent., and loses about sixteen per cent. in weight.
</p>
<p>
Roast once a week or oftener.
</p>
<p>
Put <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in the apparatus (cylinder, or drum, or roaster), the quantity to be according to the size of the roaster, or according to how much is needed. Have a rather slow fire at first; when the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> has swollen, augment the fire, turning, shaking, tossing the roaster, sometimes
<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=52"/>
fast, sometimes slowly, and take from the fire a little before it is roasted enough; the roasting will be finished before the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> gets cold and before taking it from the roaster, which you continue turning and shaking as if it were yet on the fire.
</p>
<p>
A <ingredient>charcoal</ingredient> fire is the handiest, and more easily regulated.
</p>
<p>
It is well roasted when it evaporates a pleasing odor and when of a brownish color.
</p>
<p>
Then take it from the roaster, spread it on a matting or on a piece of cloth, and put it in a tin-box as soon as cold.
</p>
<p>
It is exceedingly difficult, if not utterly impossible, to roast <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> properly by machinery, and for two reasons: in the first place, there is too much of it in the cylinder to roast evenly, some <ingredient>berries</ingredient> are burned, others not roasted enough; the other is, that being turned by machinery, the cylinder is turned regularly and is neither shaken nor tossed; and even if there were not too much <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in it, some <ingredient>berries</ingredient> would be much more roasted than others.
</p>
<p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO MAKE.</purpose> Set a kettle of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> on the fire. Place the ground <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in the filter, and as soon as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> begins to boil, pour just enough of it over the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to wet it. Put the kettle back on the fire, and again, at the first boiling, pour it over the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> rather slowly, and till you have poured enough <ingredient>water</ingredient> to furnish the quantity of <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> required.
</p>
<p>
If the <ingredient>water</ingredient> does not pass through fast enough, just stop pouring for a few seconds, that is, long enough to put the kettle back on the fire and start the boiling again. As soon as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has passed through, the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is made. The quantity of <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> must be according to the strength you wish it, and the quantity wanted, or according to age and constitution.

<ingredient>TEA.</ingredient> There are many ways of making <ingredient>tea;</ingredient> we might say that every one makes it in his own way; but, after many experiments and much information, we have found the following to be the best:
</p>
<p>
Warm the teapot either by pouring <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> in it and emptying it, or by placing it on a corner of the range.
</p>
<p>
Then put good <ingredient>tea</ingredient> in it (the quantity to be according to the strength and also to the quantity you want), and pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> on the leaves, just enough to wet
<pb n="59" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=61"/>
them; leave thus about one minute, then pour on all the <ingredient>water</ingredient> you want.
</p>
<p>
Let it steep no longer than about six minutes, and not less than four minutes, before drawing it.
</p>
<p>
If allowed to steep longer than six minutes, all the astringency of the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> is extracted, and it acts and has a bad effect on the nervous system, besides losing most of its aroma.
</p>
<p>
Chemists and physiologists generally recommend <ingredient>black tea,</ingredient> as not affecting the nervous system as much as <ingredient>green tea.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Tea</ingredient> being naturally very astringent, should never be served at breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Taken after dinner, instead of 
<emph rend="italic">caf&#233; noir,</emph> it has the same effect, and <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> may be mixed with it as in <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Tea</ingredient> is excellent in damp climates and marshy countries, but it must be taken after a substantial meal.
</p>
<p>
Drinking warm <ingredient>tea</ingredient> while eating causes the food to pass through the system without nourishing it, or supplying its waste.

<chapter class1="soups">
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">POTAGES OR SOUPS.</hd>
<p>
POTAGE is the modern word for soup, and is used in bills of fare everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Three kinds of liquor are used to make potages: broth, milk, and water.
</p>
<p>
Besides the liquor, meat, fish, and vegetables are used.
</p>
<p>
The richest potages are made with 
<ingredient><emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;</emph></ingredient> and some other compounds; such as <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> Italian pastes, vegetables, etc.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Consomm&#233;</emph> means rich <ingredient>broth;</ingredient> literally, it means consumed, perfect, that is, properly reduced and partly consumed, as it is the case in making it. 
<emph rend="italic">Consomm&#233;</emph> is <ingredient>broth</ingredient> reduced to a certain point, according to want or taste.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Broth.</ingredient></emph>--<ingredient>Broth</ingredient> is to good cooking what wheat is to bread. Dishes (with some exceptions) prepared without broth are, to those prepared with it, what rye or corn bread is to wheat bread. Broth, and especially 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;,</emph> are to old age what milk is to the infant. Broth is called 
<emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> in France, and 
<emph rend="italic">stock</emph> in England. The word 
<emph rend="italic">pot-au-feu</emph> means the meat, vegetables, seasonings, spices, and the "pot" or soup-kettle itself, 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> every thing made use of in making <ingredient>broth.</ingredient> The popular meaning of the term in France is, the soup and the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> and vegetables served
<pb n="62" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=64"/>
as 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s;</emph> and, with the working-classes, the only thing (with <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> and <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>) composing the family dinner. The French army is fed on this 
<emph rend="italic">pot-au-feu</emph> three hundred and sixty days in the year.
</p>
<p>
It is a great mistake to believe that <ingredient>bones</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal</ingredient> make good <ingredient>broth;</ingredient> by boiling or simmering <ingredient>bones</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> you obtain a gelatinous liquid, but not a rich broth with a pleasant flavor. When properly made, broth is clear. If milky, it has been made with <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> or very inferior <ingredient>beef.</ingredient>
</p>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose><ingredient>Broth</ingredient> for </purpose>Potages.</emph>--Take three pounds of good, lean, fresh <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> from any part except the shin. There must not be more than two ounces of <ingredient>bone</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and the less <ingredient>bone</ingredient> the better. Place the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in a soup-kettle or iron saucepan lined with tin, with three quarts of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and set it on a good fire. After about thirty minutes, the scum or albumen of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will gather on the surface, and the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will commence boiling. Now place the kettle on a more moderate fire, add one gill of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and begin to skim off the scum, which will take only a few minutes. Then add one middle-sized <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> half as much <ingredient>turnip,</ingredient> one middle-sized <ingredient>leek,</ingredient> a stalk of <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> a <ingredient>bay-leaf,</ingredient> one <ingredient>onion</ingredient> with two <ingredient>cloves</ingredient> stuck in it, and two <ingredient>cloves of garlic.</ingredient> Keep the kettle between simmering and boiling heat for about five hours. Dish the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> <ingredient>turnip,</ingredient> and <ingredient>leek</ingredient> around it, and serve it as a 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;.</emph> Strain the <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> and it is ready for use.
</p>
<p>
If the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> is required to be richer, use more <ingredient>beef</ingredient> and less <ingredient>water,</ingredient> but follow the same process; if weaker, use more <ingredient>water</ingredient> and less <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> but still follow the same process.
</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose><ingredient>Broth</ingredient> for Sauces and <ingredient>Gravies.</ingredient></purpose></emph>--Place in a soup-kettle
<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=65"/>
or saucepan fresh <ingredient>bones of beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> or poultry--of either, or of all; also, <ingredient>bones</ingredient> of the same <ingredient>meats</ingredient> from roasted pieces; also trimmings of the same, if very fresh, with one quart of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to every pound of <ingredient>bones</ingredient> or <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> skim it like the preceding, add the same vegetables and seasonings, and simmer for at least six hours. Then skim off very carefully all the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> on the surface, pass the remainder through a strainer or a sieve, and it is ready for use. This <ingredient>broth</ingredient> is certainly very inferior to the preceding one, but it is excellent for sauces and <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> and is very cheaply made. It may be used for potages also; but, as we have said above, it is very gelatinous, and cannot be compared with the highly nutritious <ingredient>beef broth.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Broth</ingredient> that is not to be used immediately must be cooled quickly after being strained, as the quicker it is cooled the longer it keeps. As soon as cold, put it in a stone jar or crockery vessel, and place it in a cool, dry, and dark place. It will keep three or four days in winter, but only one day in summer. If the weather is stormy, it will not keep even for twelve hours; it turns sour very quickly.
</p>
<p>
I do not put <ingredient>parsnips</ingredient> or <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> in <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> the taste of these two vegetables being too strong. They really neutralize the fine aroma of <ingredient>broth.</ingredient> Even in this nineteenth century there are some pretty good cooks who put <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsnip</ingredient> in <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> but they do it by routine. Routine is in every thing the greatest enemy of progress. Ancient cookery used to put in the 
<emph rend="italic">pot</emph> (old name for soup-kettle) a burnt <ingredient>onion</ingredient> to give an amber color to the <ingredient>broth.</ingredient> This has exactly the same effect as <ingredient>thyme</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsnip,</ingredient> giving it a bad taste, and neutralizing the flavor given to the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> by the osmazome of the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> When <ingredient>broth</ingredient> of an
<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=66"/>
amber color is desired, add to it a few drops of <ingredient>burnt sugar,</ingredient> the receipt for making which will be found elsewhere.
</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Consomm&#233;.</purpose></emph>--There are two ways of making 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;:</emph> one is to make <ingredient>broth</ingredient> as above, with the exception that five pounds of <ingredient>lean beef,</ingredient> instead of three, are used with three quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and simmered from seven to eight hours, instead of five, the vegetables and seasonings being the same; or by boiling <ingredient>broth</ingredient> gently till properly reduced.
</p>
<p>
The other way is to roast, until they are only one-third done, one, two, or three <ingredient>fowls,</ingredient> not under two years old; then place them in a soup-kettle with three pounds of <ingredient>lean beef;</ingredient> wet with three quarts of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> skim off as above directed; add the same <ingredient>vegetables</ingredient> and <ingredient>seasonings</ingredient> as for <ingredient>broth</ingredient> for potages. After having simmered the whole for three hours, the <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> or <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> must be taken out of the kettle, and the rest is to be simmered for about three hours longer. The <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> <ingredient>vegetables,</ingredient> and <ingredient>seasonings</ingredient> are then taken from the kettle or saucepan; the liquor is strained, and that liquor is the best 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;</emph> that can be made; or by boiling the same, gently, in three quarts of good <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> you make 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;</emph> also.
</p>
<p>
The reason for directing to use one, two, or three <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> is, that the more <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> used, the better and richer the <ingredient>broth.</ingredient> The <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> after having been thus used may be prepared in salad, and make a very excellent dish.
</p>
<p>
One pound of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is enough to make <ingredient>broth</ingredient> for a potage for three or four persons.
</p>
<p>
Always use fresh <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with a <ingredient>venison</ingredient> taste or tainted would spoil if not entirely destroy the <ingredient>broth.</ingredient>
</p>
</recipe>

<ingredient>broth;</ingredient> boil gently about ten minutes, and strain through a cloth or towel.
</p>
<p>
Any kind of potage made with <ingredient>broth</ingredient> may be made with 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;.</emph> It may also be made with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> adding <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> With 
<emph rend="italic">consomm&#233;</emph> it is richer, and with <ingredient>water</ingredient> much inferior, than with <ingredient>broth.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
When a <ingredient>rump-piece</ingredient> is used to make <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> it is better to <ingredient>bone</ingredient> it first, and take it from the soup-kettle after three or four hours; it is served as a 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;,</emph> or prepared as <ingredient>cold beef.</ingredient> The <ingredient>broth</ingredient> is finished as directed; the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> and vegetables being kept on the fire longer than the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient>

Louis XV. was on a visit to the monastery of Saint-Denis one day during Lent; after having walked all over the grounds and gardens, he was offered a cup of broth by the superior.
</p>
<p>
Being a little fatigued, he took the cup and drank the whole at one draught.
</p>
<p>
In going back to Versailles, one of his suite, who did not like the monk-superior, adroitly alluded to the cup of broth, and managed to persuade the king that the monk had done it on purpose; that is, had made the king partake of meat-broth, when it was forbidden by the Church.
</p>
<p>
The next day the monk-superior was sent for and brought before the king. On hearing the object of the summons, he asked the king if the broth had indisposed him. Being answered in the negative, he begged to be allowed to prepare the same broth before the king himself, which he did, and from that time till his death the

</p>
<p>
Put all the rest, shell, small claws, all the matter found in the large shell (green, white, or yellow), in a mortar and pound well. Then put a tablespoonful of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in a saucepan, set it on the fire, and when the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is melted, put what is in the mortar in, stir with a wooden spoon for about ten minutes, then add one pint of <ingredient>warm broth,</ingredient> stir for about twenty minutes, and strain.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">SAUCES.</hd>
<p>
There is no good cooking possible without good sauces. Many excellent pieces of meat, etc., are spoiled by being served with a poor sauce.
</p>
<p>
Let every one bear in mind that water is no substitute for broth; that vinegar or water is no substitute for wine, etc.
</p>
<p>
There is no place where the old proverb can be better applied than in the kitchen, "Waste not, spare not."
</p>
<p>
The 
<emph rend="italic">French, Italians, Spaniards,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">Germans</emph>, use <ingredient>broth</ingredient> and <ingredient>wine</ingredient> in their cooking, and do not spend as much as the 
<emph rend="italic">Americans</emph> for their food; they could not afford it; but they waste not, neither do they lose any thing good through carelessness or prejudice.
</p>
<p>
Good sauces are not as difficult to make as is generally believed.
</p>
<p>
This general belief comes from the fact that many, after having partaken of a certain dish somewhere, and liking it much, ask of their own cook to prepare the same.
</p>
<p>
The cook, most probably, has never heard of it, but nevertheless prepares a dish which is hardly eatable, and is to the other what a <ingredient>crab-apple</ingredient> is to a <ingredient>raspberry.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
The most important thing in making a <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> is for the cook to put his or her whole attention and care to it.
</p>
<pb n="98" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=100"/>
<p>
Most sauces must be stirred continually while on the fire, and especially <ingredient>white</ingredient> sauces, such as 
<emph rend="italic">B&#233;chamel, B&#233;chamel</emph> with <ingredient>cream</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream sauce,</ingredient> and <ingredient>white sauce.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to stir all sauces now and then, to prevent the forming of a kind of <ingredient>skin</ingredient> on the surface.
</p>
<p>
The <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> <ingredient>shallots,</ingredient> garlics, and <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> used in sharp sauces, may be prepared as described for 
<emph rend="italic">piquante</emph> <ingredient>sauce.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Sauces can always be made to suit the taste. A thousand can be made as well as a hundred, by merely adding or subtracting one or more of the compounds, or by proceeding differently. An idea of what can be done in that line can be formed by reading our directions for SUPREME <ingredient>SAUCE.</ingredient>

<p>
THE Indians bleed the fish as soon as caught, because the flesh is firmer when cooked.
</p>
<p>
The Dutch and the French bleed the cod, which accounts for the better quality and whiteness of their codfish.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To select.</emph>--To be good, fish must be fresh. It is fresh when the eyes are clear, the fins stiff, the gills red, hard to open, and without bad odor.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To clean and prepare for boiling.</emph>--The sooner fish is cleaned the better. Cut the belly open, take the inside out, wash well and wipe dry immediately with a clean towel, inside and out. Place the eggs or soft roes inside, and tie with twine. It is then ready to be boiled.
</p>
<p>
If not cooked as soon as cleaned and prepared, keep it on ice.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To clean and prepare for baking, frying, roasting, and to cut in pieces, etc.</emph>--Scale the fish well, holding it by the head or tail; cut the belly open and take the inside out; trim off the fins, gills, and tail; wash well inside and out, and wipe dry immediately.
</p>
<p>
Keep it on ice if not used immediately.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Same Family, or Kind.</emph>--We give only one receipt for all the fishes of the same family, or having the same kind
<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=128"/>
of flesh, as they are cooked alike, and require the same spices.
</p>
<p>
Almost every kind of fish is boiled, broiled, fried, or stewed. Some are better boiled than broiled, others better fried than stewed etc. With few exceptions, any eatable fish may be cooked in these four ways. Few are roasted.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To know when cooked enough.</emph>--It is very difficult, if not entirely impossible, to tell how long it takes to cook fish, as it depends as much on the size, kind, or quality of the fish as on the fire; but as soon as the flesh comes off the bones easily, the fish is cooked; this is very easy to be ascertained with a knife.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To improve.</emph>--Clean the fish as for baking, etc., and lay it in a crockery vessel with the following seasonings under and upon it: parsley and onions chopped fine, salt, pepper, thyme, bay-leaves, and vinegar or oil; turn it over occasionally, and leave thus for two or three hours.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To bone.</emph>--Slit the fish on one side of the backbone and fins, from head to tail; then run the knife between the bones and the flesh so as to detach the whole side from the rest; do the same for the other side.
</p>
<p>
For a flounder, or any other flat fish, slit right in the middle of both sides of the fish so as to make four instead of two pieces.
</p>
<p>
The head, bones, and fins are not used at all, and are left in one piece.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To serve, when boiled.</emph>--The fish is placed on a napkin and on a dish or platter, surrounded with parsley, and the sauce served in a saucer.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To skin.</emph>--Take hold of the piece of fish by the smaller end, and with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand; run the knife between the flesh and skin, moving the knife
<pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=129"/>
to and fro as if you were sawing. Throw away the skin, and the fish is ready for cooking.
</p>
<p>
If the skin were breaking, as it happens sometimes, take hold of it again, and proceed as before.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">To decorate.</emph>--Fish may be decorated with <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> but it is easier and more sightly with <ingredient>craw-fish.</ingredient> The skewers are stuck in the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> as they are in a 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fillet of beef.</ingredient></emph>
</p>
<p>
The <ingredient>craw-fish</ingredient> when boiled are red like the lobster, and, besides using them with skewers, some may be placed all around the <ingredient>fish;</ingredient> it is delicate eating as well as sightly. Skewers are never used with <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>vinaigrette,</ingredient></emph> or when the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is cut in pieces. The <ingredient>craw-fish</ingredient> has only to be boiled before using it for decorating <ingredient>fish.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Shrimps</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>prawns</ingredient></emph> are used the same as <ingredient>craw-fish.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Oysters</ingredient></emph> are also used, raw or blanched; run the skewer through a large <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> or <ingredient>craw-fish,</ingredient> then through a slice of <ingredient>truffle;</ingredient> again through an <ingredient>oyster,</ingredient> <ingredient>truffle,</ingredient> etc.; through two, three, or more of each, according to the size of the skewer or of the fish.

<p>
Never buy a dead <ingredient>lobster.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Large <ingredient>lobsters</ingredient> are not as good as small ones. From about one to two pounds and a half in weight are the best. The heavier the better.
</p>
<p>
Lobsters are better at some seasons of the year than at others. They are inferior when full of eggs.
</p>
<p>
It is from mere prejudice that the liver (also called 
<emph rend="italic">tomalley</emph>) is eschewed. This prejudice may come from its turning green on boiling the lobster.

<p>
Use every thing but the stomach and the black or bluish vein running along its back and tail.
</p>
<p>
Boil your <ingredient>lobsters</ingredient> yourself; because, if you buy them already boiled, you do not know if they were alive when put in the kettle.
</p>
<p>
A <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> boiled after being dead is watery, soft, and not full; besides being very unhealthy, if not dangerous.
</p>
<p>
A <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> suffers less by being put in cold than in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and the flesh is firmer when done.

<p>
The American <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> is unquestionably the best that can be found. It varies in taste according to how it is treated, either after being dredged or while embedded; and also according to the nature of the soil and <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which they have lived. It is very wrong to wash <ingredient>oysters.</ingredient> We mean by washing <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> the abominable habit of throwing <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> as soon as opened, and then sold by the measure. It is more than a pity to thus spoil such an excellent and delicate article of food.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Oysters,</ingredient> like <ingredient>lobsters,</ingredient> are not good when dead. To ascertain if they are alive, as soon as opened and when one of the shells is removed, touch gently the edge of the <ingredient>oyster,</ingredient> and, if alive, it will contract.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">A LA MODE.</purpose> Take from six to twelve pounds of <ingredient>rump</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> it. To <ingredient>lard</ingredient> it you take a steel needle made for that purpose, flat near the pointed end and much larger than an ordinary larding-needle. It must be flat near the point in order to cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> so as to make room for the larger part of the needle to pass, and also for the <ingredient>salt pork.</ingredient> This needle is only used for <ingredient>beef</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode.</emph>
</p>
<p>
Cut the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> in square strips to fit the needle, 
<emph rend="italic">(see</emph> Larding), and proceed.
</p>
<p>
Examine the piece of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> with the grain of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> so that when it is carved the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> shall be cut across.
</p>
<p>
If the piece is too thick to run the strip of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> through, so that both ends stick out, <ingredient>lard</ingredient> one side first then the other. We mean by one side first, this: to be easily handled, the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> cannot be cut longer than about four inches; as half an inch of it must stick out of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> it leaves only three inches inside, and if the piece of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> be six inches or more thick, of course it would be impossible to have the strip of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> stick out on both sides; therefore, you <ingredient>lard</ingredient> one side first; that is, you run the needle through the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> leaving the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> stick out on the side you commence, and when that side is larded, do the same for the other. You have then the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> sticking out on both sides of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and looking just as if the strips were running through the whole piece.
</p>
<p>
Some like more <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> than others in the <ingredient>beef;</ingredient> the strips may be run thickly or thinly.
</p>
<p>
Thirty strips may be run into three pounds of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> as well as half a dozen; but about half a pound of <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> to five pounds of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is a pretty good proportion.
</p>
<pb n="164" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=166"/>
<p>
Then take a saucepan of a proper size for the piece of <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> it must not be too large or too small, but large enough to hold the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> without being obliged to bend or fold it; a crockery pan is certainly the best for that purpose, and one that will go easily in the oven.
</p>
<p>
Put in the saucepan, for six pounds of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> half a <ingredient>calf's foot,</ingredient> or a <ingredient>veal-bone</ingredient> if more handy, two ounces of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> half a handful of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> (<ingredient>cives,</ingredient> if handy), two <ingredient>bay-leaves,</ingredient> a <ingredient>clove of garlic,</ingredient> a sprig of <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> two <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> with a <ingredient>clove</ingredient> stuck in each, <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> half a <ingredient>carrot</ingredient> cut in slices, the <ingredient>rind</ingredient> of the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> you have used, and what you may have left of strips; the whole well spread on the bottom of the pan, then the piece of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> over, cover the pan, set on a rather sharp fire and after about ten minutes add half a gill of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> keep the pan covered to the end.
</p>
<p>
After another ten or fifteen minutes, add about one pint of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> turn the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> over, and after about ten minutes more, place the pan in the oven, a rather slow oven (a little above 220 degrees Fahr.), for five or six hours.

<emph rend="italic">filet</emph>--<ingredient>tenderloin.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Sirloin</ingredient> means surloin; like 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>stock</ingredient></emph> and several others, <ingredient>sirloin</ingredient> is purely English. The surloin is the upper part of the <ingredient>loin,</ingredient> as its prefix indicates; it is 
<emph rend="italic">surlonge</emph> in French.
</p>
<p>
A fillet is generally larded with <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> by means of a small brass larding-needle; the <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> cut in strips to fit the needle 
<emph rend="italic">(see</emph> LARDING).
</p>
<p>
If you use a <ingredient>tenderloin,</ingredient> trim off the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> If it is a piece of <ingredient>ribs,</ingredient> prepared fillet-like, shape it like a fillet as near as possible; the rest is used as directed above.
</p>
<p>
A piece of <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> is certainly cheaper, and can be had at any time, while the other is as difficult to procure as it is dear.

</p>
<p>
Run the needle through the upper part of the convex surface, commencing at about a quarter of an inch from the edge of one side, running through the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> a distance of about one inch and a half, about half an inch in depth at the middle, and the strip of <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> sticking out at both ends; that is, where the needle was introduced into the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and where it came out of it. Repeat this till you have a row of strips across the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the strips being about one-third of an inch apart.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Lard</ingredient> row after row in the same way, and till the whole flat side is covered; the ends of the strips of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> sticking out of each row being intermingled.

<p>
What is called a <ingredient>porter-house steak</ingredient> is the <ingredient>tenderloin,</ingredient> <ingredient>sirloin,</ingredient> and other surrounding parts cut in slices.
</p>
<p>
A <ingredient>steak</ingredient> should never be less than three-quarters of an inch in thickness.
</p>
<p>
It should always be broiled; it is inferior in taste and flavor when cooked in a pan

<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;,</emph> it is served alike.

The same rules are applied to <ingredient>steaks of venison,</ingredient> <ingredient>pork,</ingredient> etc.; <ingredient>turtle-steaks</ingredient> are also prepared like <ingredient>beef-steaks.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
A good <ingredient>steak</ingredient> does not need any pounding; the object of pounding a <ingredient>steak</ingredient> is to break its fibres. A pounded <ingredient>steak</ingredient> may appear or taste more tender to a person not knowing or never having tasted a good <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> but an experienced palate cannot be deceived.

It is better to broil before than over the fire.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">MUTTON.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">HOW TO SELECT.</hd>
<p>
YOU may be sure that mutton is good when the flesh is rather black, and the fat white; if the fat breaks easily, it is young.
</p>
<p>
The wether is much superior to the ewe.
</p>
<p>
You will know if a leg of mutton comes from a wether, if there is a large and hard piece of fat on one side at the larger and upper end; if from a ewe, that part is merely a kind of skin, with a little fat on it.
</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<alt synonym1="roasted mutton"></alt><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">ROASTED.</purpose> A piece of <ingredient>mutton</ingredient> to roast must not be too fresh, it is much more tender when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is rather seasoned, but not tainted, or what is sometimes called "high." When on the spit, place it near the fire, baste immediately with a little melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and then with the <ingredient>drippings.</ingredient> As soon as you notice that a kind of crust or coating has formed around the piece of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> remove it a little from the fire by degrees; and continue basting till done. The quicker the crust is formed, though without burning the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the more juicy and tender it will be.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Roast mutton,</ingredient> like <ingredient>roast beef,</ingredient> is better served rather underdone, but should be a little more done than <ingredient>beef.</ingredient> When properly roasted, the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> whatever piece it may be,
<pb n="185" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=187"/>
either a <ingredient>loin</ingredient> or <ingredient>saddle,</ingredient> a <ingredient>leg,</ingredient> shoulder, or a <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> may be served with its <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> only; that is, with what is in the dripping-pan after having removed all the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> also on a 
<emph rend="italic">soubise</emph> or on a 
<emph rend="italic">pur&#233;e</emph> of <ingredient>sorrel.</ingredient> The above pieces may also be served in the following ways:
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">With <ingredient>Potatoes.</ingredient></emph>--When dished, surround the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> either fried, mashed, or in 
<emph rend="italic">croquettes.</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">With Quenelles.</emph>--Dish the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> place half a dozen 
<emph rend="italic">quenelles</emph> around it, and decorate it with skewers which you have run through a 
<emph rend="italic">quenelle</emph> and then through a <ingredient>crawfish</ingredient> and stuck in the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">With <ingredient>Carrots.</ingredient></emph>--When dished, put all around the <ingredient>meat carrots</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">au jus,</emph> or glazed and cut with a vegetable spoon.

<emph rend="italic">With <ingredient>Spinach.</ingredient></emph>--<ingredient>Spinach</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">au jus</emph> when done is spread on the dish, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is put on it, and served warm. Do the same with a

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><alt synonym1="baked mutton">BAKED.</alt></purpose> All the above pieces are baked as well as roasted; and when done, served exactly in the same and every way as when roasted.
</p>
<p>
Put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in a baking-pan with a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> spread over it; cover the bottom of the pan with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> then put in a quick oven. After it has been in the oven for about fifteen minutes, baste and place a piece of <ingredient>buttered paper</ingredient> on the top of the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> If the bottom of the pan is getting dry, add a little more <ingredient>water,</ingredient> but it is seldom the case except with inferior <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> When you see rather too much <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in the pan, take from the oven, turn the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> off, put <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> instead, and put back in the oven to finish the cooking. If the paper burns, put
<pb n="186" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=188"/>
on another piece; but by basting often over the <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> it will remain pretty long before burning.
</p>
<p>
With a small knife or a skewer you ascertain when done enough or to your liking; never cook by guess or by hearsay; the oven may be quicker one day than another, or slower; the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> may be more tender, or more <ingredient>hard;</ingredient> remember that if you cook by guess (we mean, to put down, as a matter of course, that it takes so many hours, or so many minutes, to bake this or that), and stick to it, you will fail nine times out of ten.

<p>
NEVER buy too young veal. It is very easy to know it; when too young, the bones are very tender; they are more like nerves than bones; the meat is gluish, and has little or no taste. Epicures say that if a calf is killed before it is two months old, or at least six weeks, it is not fit for eating. We are of that opinion, although, perhaps, very few are allowed so long a life. We will therefore recommend our readers to beware buying too young veal; many diseases, especially in children, come from eating it.
</p>
<p>
When you broil or roast a piece of veal, baste often. Veal is better when a little overdone; it is not good, and operates like physic, if underdone.
</p>
<p>
The best veal is that of a greenish color and very fat. It is fresh when the eyes are full and smooth, and when the meat is firm. If the meat is yellowish or contains yellowish spots, it is not fresh. The veins must be red.

of <ingredient>sweet-oil;</ingredient> leave the <ingredient>veal</ingredient> thus about four or five hours in winter and about two in summer.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p>
<purpose align="center" rend="bold"><alt synonym1="veal roasted"> ROASTED.</alt></purpose> The pieces of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> that are roasted are the 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>loin,</ingredient> <ingredient>leg,</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">shoulder.</emph>
</p>
<p>
It may be improved as directed above or not, according to taste; but we earnestly recommend it as not a little improvement, but as a marked one, as everybody can try it and judge, <ingredient>veal</ingredient> being naturally tasteless.
</p>
<p>
There are three ways of roasting <ingredient>veal.</ingredient> We will describe them, so that it can be done according to taste.
</p>
<p>
1. Spread a thin coat of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> around the piece of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> after being salted all around, put on the spit before a good but not very sharp fire; near it, but not too much so: <ingredient>veal</ingredient> being more tender than <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> it would also burn much quicker. Baste often with melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> first, and then with the <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> and from the beginning to the end. When done, that is, when overdone, as <ingredient>veal</ingredient> must always be, serve with the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> only, or in the different ways described below.
</p>
<p>
2. <ingredient>Lard</ingredient> all the fleshy parts of the piece of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> with a larding-needle and strips of <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> the same as a <ingredient>fillet of beef,</ingredient> but which strips you roll in a mixture of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> chopped, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> before running them into the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and proceed as above for the rest. Serve also like the above.
</p>
<p>
3. After the piece of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> is improved as directed, spread the seasonings in which it has been improved all around it, then envelop the whole in <ingredient>buttered paper,</ingredient> which you fasten with twine, put it on the spit, and baste often with melted <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> It must be basted often to prevent the <ingredient>paper</ingredient> from burning. About fifteen minutes before it is
<pb n="204" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=206"/>
done, remove the <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> a little nearer the fire so as to give it a fine yellow or golden color, finish the cooking till overdone, and serve also like the first, or No. 1.
</p>
<p>
No matter which of these three ways the piece of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> is roasted, it is served in the same manner.

When the rind is tender and thin, the pork is young; when thick and hard, it is old.
</p>
<p>
To be good, the meat must be soft, and have a fresh and good appearance.
</p>
<p>
We do not think it necessary to indicate here how to make black puddings, chitterlings, Bologna, and other sausages. It is nearly, if not quite impossible, for a person having no practice in it, to make them edible; it is better to buy them ready made at pork-butchers' shops, or to hire an experienced person to make them.

<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><alt synonym1="how to prepare and clean poultry">HOW TO PREPARE AND CLEAN.</alt></purpose> To transport poultry, 
<emph rend="italic">see</emph> <ingredient>GAME.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Poulterers are of the opinion that the best and quickest way of killing poultry is by cutting the throat or the <ingredient>tongue.</ingredient> Tie the legs of the <ingredient>bird,</ingredient> hang it by the legs, then kill and let bleed. Some cut the <ingredient>head</ingredient> off and throw it away on the ground, but the poor things do not die so fast, and therefore suffer more.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the throat or <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> is cut, if the <ingredient>head</ingredient> is held down the bird dies sooner, as it allows the blood to run more freely, preventing the bird from bending and twisting its <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and also from swallowing its blood.
</p>
<p>
It is much better to pick the bird dry. By scalding, the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> is spoiled, and very often the flesh of a young and tender <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> is spoiled also, being blanched. When picked, singe the bird carefully, in order not to burn the <ingredient>skin.</ingredient>
</p>
<p>
Split the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> on the back of the <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> from the body
<pb n="238" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=240"/>
to near the <ingredient>head;</ingredient> then detach the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> from the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> by pulling it downward and the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> upward; it gives you plenty of room to pull the crop out, which you do. Cut the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> off at about the middle of the <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> close to the body; that part of the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> is left to cover the place where the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> was cut off, by turning it on the back of the bird, and holding it with twine in trussing.
</p>
<p>
Make an incision under the <ingredient>rump,</ingredient> lengthwise, and large enough to draw the bird easily.
</p>
<p>
When drawn, wipe the inside of the bird with a towel, but do not wash it, except when you have broken the <ingredient>gall</ingredient>-bladder. If that should happen, cut the bird in pieces immediately and wash well in <ingredient>lukewarm water;</ingredient> never roast or prepare whole a bird that has had the <ingredient>gall</ingredient>-bladder broken in it in drawing it. 
<emph rend="italic">Saut&#233;</emph> it or prepare it in fricassee.
</p>
<p>
If there should be any thing unclean on the outside, wipe it off, if possible, or otherwise cut the place off, or wash only the unclean place. A washed bird is a very inferior article. If you see that a bird cannot be cleansed properly except by washing it, do not buy it.

put the bird on the table on its back, and with a chopper or with a round stick flatten the <ingredient>breast-bone,</ingredient> which you break at a single blow if possible; the bird is much more sightly when served. Cut the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> off just above the first joint, or cut off only half of the claws and trim off the ends of the <ingredient>wings.</ingredient> Place the bird on a table, the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> up and the <ingredient>rump</ingredient> toward you. Push the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> under the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> so that, by holding them perpendicularly and pressing on them, the part from the second to the third joint is alongside the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> or horizontally. Then run a trussing-needle, with twine attached to it, just above the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> of the <ingredient>leg,</ingredient> as near the second joint as possible, on the side (toward you) of the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> of the <ingredient>leg</ingredient> that is perpendicular, through the <ingredient>leg</ingredient> (which <ingredient>leg</ingredient> is the left one of the bird), body, and also through the bird, and at the same place, that is, as near the second joint as possible. Turn the bird upside down and the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> toward you; turn the ends of the <ingredient>wings</ingredient> on the back, as seen in the cut (p. 240), turn the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> on the back also, between or under the <ingredient>wings</ingredient> and in order to cover the place where the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> has been cut off, then run the needle again through the right <ingredient>wing,</ingredient> the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> and part of the body, and through the other <ingredient>wing.</ingredient> Tie the ends of the twine fast together.
</p>
<p>
As it is, the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> of the bird, when on its back, are pointing upward. Bend them gently down till they are perpendicular and as seen in the cut, run the trussing-needle through both and also through the body, above the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> of the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and under the end of the <ingredient>breast-bone;</ingredient> run it again the other way, but under the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> of the <ingredient>legs,</ingredient> tie the two ends of the twine together, and you have a bird trussed exactly like the one represented in the cut on next page.

<illustration><description>An illustration of a Full Chicken on a Skewer.</description>

<p>
Another way to truss is, to cut only half of the claws, instead of cutting the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> at the first joint; but, to truss thus, the first joint must be partly cut as represented below. If the nerve were not cut, it would contract in cooking, and instead of being straight, the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> would point upward.
</p>
<illustration><description>An illustration of a Full Chicken.</description>
</illustration>
<p>
A bird stuffed is trussed exactly in the same way as above, with the exception that the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> must be sewed up with a trussing-needle before commencing to truss the <ingredient>legs,</ingredient> and the incision must also be sewed up as soon as filled and before trussing.
</p>
<p>
The twine used to sew and truss the bird is removed just before dishing it.
</p>
<p>
Some experiments have been made lately, in France, to find out the best way to kill <ingredient>chickens</ingredient> and make them tender. Those killed by electricity were more tender than any other, but they must be cooked immediately, as they become tainted in a very short time.

<chapter class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">GAME.</hd>
<p>
GAME, comparatively, is appreciated only by a few.
</p>
<p>
When the country was first settled, every one was his own provider, and of course game was not sent to a market several hundred miles from the place where it was shot or caught. But settlement and civilization have the same effect on game as they have on barbarians or savages--they drive it away.
</p>
<p>
Our Northeastern cities are now supplied by the Western States with game. In winter time, game may be kept for weeks without being spoiled or losing its natural flavor and taste, when kept where it is killed; but when transported, it is very different. To transport it requires packing. As soon as packed, it naturally ferments; and even if packed when frozen, the middle of the barrel will ferment and become injured, if not entirely rendered unfit for the table.
</p>
<p>
The packing of game or poultry in barrels is a bad practice. Nothing requires more ventilation than game while being transported. Many dealers have their game sent to them in wicker-baskets with plenty of straw, but the greater part is still sent in barrels; hence the musty taste when cooked.
</p>
<p>
To keep game for some time when fresh, open the animal or bird under the rump, just enough to take the
<pb n="277" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=279"/>
inside out, also the crop of birds, being very careful about the gall-bladder; if it bursts, it is better not to try to preserve the piece, but to clean, wash, and use it as soon as possible. Birds must be left in their feathers, and animals in their skins. Fill the inside with dry and clean oats, and put the piece in a heap or barrel of oats. It will keep thus for many days.
</p>
<p>
Another way is to envelop the piece well in a towel, and bury it in charcoal dust in a cool and dry place.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">How to clean and prepare.</emph>--Clean and prepare the birds as directed for poultry in general.
</p>
<p>
After having carefully skinned, take out the inside, and cut the legs off at the first joint of animals; wash the inside with lukewarm water, and wipe it dry with a clean towel immediately after; wipe also the outside, but do not wash it if possible; that is, if you can clean it well by wiping only.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Wild ducks, geese, pigeons,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>turkeys,</ingredient></emph> are prepared, cooked, and served like tame ones.

<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Bear-meat</ingredient> and Buffalo.</emph>--The <ingredient>meat</ingredient> of all large animals is better roasted, than dressed in any other way.

<emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode,</emph> or stewed.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Bear-meat</ingredient> has highly nutritive qualities, and is very warming.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Buffalo-steaks</ingredient> are said to be better broiled on cinders without a gridiron, than on or before coals with one; that is, Indian fashion and even hunters' fashion.
</p>
<p>
Indians often use <ingredient>wood-ashes</ingredient> as a substitute for <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and never use <ingredient>salt</ingredient> with <ingredient>buffalo-meat;</ingredient> but their liking or preference comes from their habit of invariably broiling <ingredient>buffalo-meat</ingredient> on wood cinders or buffalo-chips.

</p>
<p>
Have a skewer, or merely a piece of wire, long enough to hold six birds; fix the skewer on the spit, and roast.
</p>
<p>
When the six birds are on the skewer, fasten them with twine, to prevent them from turning round, as seen in the cut.

Small birds have a better flavor when cooked after being somewhat seasoned than when cooked fresh, but they must not be tainted. As long as the rump is stiff, they are good; if soft, they must be examined carefully, as they might be tainted. When young, there is no stiffness in the legs. Small birds are generally put by the half dozen

We have tasted of all of them except the raccoon, and we must say that we found them palatable. It is well known that when our soldiers retook possession of Ship Island, they found plenty of raccoons on it, and ate all they could catch. One day we happened to meet a sub-officer, who was there at the time, and inquired of him about it. He said he had never eaten any raccoons before, and did not know that they were eatable; but now he could eat them as readily as <ingredient>rabbits,</ingredient> as they were quite as good.
</p>
<pb n="298" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=300"/>
<p>
The best time to eat any of the animals enumerated above is from Christmas to the 15th of February.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">How to prepare them.</emph>--As soon as the animal is killed skin it, take the inside out, save the <ingredient>liver</ingredient> and <ingredient>heart,</ingredient> and wash well with <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> inside and out; then wipe dry with a towel, put inside a few leaves of <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> <ingredient>bay-leaves,</ingredient> <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> and <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> and sew it up. Hang it outside in a place sheltered from the sun, such as the northern side of a building; leave it thus five or six days, then take off, and cook.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>How to skin a Skunk.</purpose></emph>--We were hunting one day in New Jersey, northwest of Paterson, with a friend and two farmers living there, when one of them shot a skunk. We asked him how much he could get for the skin. He said it was not worth while to take it to town, but that he would eat the animal, as it was very good.
</p>
<p>
We thought at first that he was joking; but putting his gun and game-bag to the ground, he looked at us earnestly, and said, "Gentlemen, you seem to doubt; I will show you how it is done." We soon saw that we had been mistaken.
</p>
<p>
He made a fire, took hold of the <ingredient>skunk</ingredient> by the <ingredient>head</ingredient> with one hand, and with a stick in the other held the skunk over the fire. He burnt off nearly all the hair, taking care to avoid burning the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> commencing at the hind <ingredient>legs;</ingredient> then with his hunting-knife he carefully cut off the bag containing the fetid matter, and skinned and cleaned it.
</p>
<p>
We then examined the skunk, and although it had not been washed, we could not find any part of it with a bad smell, and if we had not seen the whole operation we certainly would not have thought that it was a skunk, the very name of which is repulsive.
</p>
<pb n="299" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=301"/>

The following week we dined with the farmer, ate some of that identical skunk, and found it very good.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">How to cook the above-named Animals.</emph>--Take out the leaves of <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> etc., which you put in the animal before exposing it to the weather.

<p>
GREEN vegetables must look fresh, and have nothing rotten about them.
</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>To boil or blanch Green Vegetables.</purpose></emph>--Whatever they are, <ingredient>spinach,</ingredient> <ingredient>green peas,</ingredient> <ingredient>asparagus,</ingredient> etc., put some <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the fire; clean the vegetable, wash it if necessary, then drop it in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> at the first boil; keep boiling for a time or till done; drain, and immediately drop it in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> drain again before using. It is impossible to tell how long it takes to boil; it depends entirely on the nature of the vegetable: for instance, <ingredient>spinach,</ingredient> as well as <ingredient>peas</ingredient> or any other vegetable, according to how tender it is, may take from three to twenty minutes to cook properly. Dry vegetables, such as <ingredient>beans,</ingredient> <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> <ingredient>lentils,</ingredient> etc., are washed or soaked in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> drained, and then set on the fire with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and no <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> renders <ingredient>beans</ingredient> much harder and retards their cooking. Other vegetables that are neither green nor dry, such as <ingredient>carrots,</ingredient> <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> etc., are generally set on the fire with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> If prepared in other ways, it is explained in the receipts.
</p>
<p>
<ingredient>Potatoes</ingredient> are generally steamed; when they must be boiled, it is explained. We recommend to drop the green vegetables in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> at the first boil, because, in boiling,
<pb n="306" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=308"/>
<ingredient>water</ingredient> evaporates its gases and alkali, and is therefore inferior for cooking purposes. Green vegetables are more acid here than in Europe, on account of the newness and richness of the soil; so is some fruit.

<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Artichokes.</purpose></emph>--The <ingredient>artichoke</ingredient> we refer to here is the plant somewhat resembling a thistle, having a large, scaly head, like the cone of the pine-tree; the lower part of the leaves composing the head, with the broad receptacle underneath, is the eatable part. It is a native of Sicily, and is an excellent and delicate vegetable. It grows well here, and the reason why it is not more generally known is because some persons who are used to live on coarse food have underrated it--their palates not being fit to appreciate its delicate flavor. We recommend gardeners and farmers to cultivate it; they will find a ready market.

We must say that we have not been able to try the experiment, but we should like very much to see what kind and how much work forty men would do, and for how long, with such a diet. There are many things that look or seem well, and even magnificent in theory, though entirely impracticable. It sounds well, especially to those who do not understand the meaning of it, to say that we feed mostly on gluten, albumen, gelatine, etc., and that we require so many ounces of carbon, oxygen, etc., in twenty-four hours. Every thing that we eat may be, with the exception of salt, turned into charcoal; but no one has yet been known to feed on it.

EGGS are fit to eat as soon as laid, and the sooner they are used the better. You ascertain if they are fresh with an oonoscope, or by holding them before a light and looking through. There are several ways to preserve eggs, but to do which they must be fresh; as soon as perfectly cold after being laid, they may be perserved. Dissolve gum in water to the consistency of thin mucilage, and with a brush give a coat of it to the eggs; lay them in a box of charcoal dust and keep them in a dry, dark, and cool place. When wanted, they are soaked in cold water for a few minutes and washed. They are also preserved in hydrate of lime. When boiled hard, let them cool and place them in a dry, cool, and dark place; they will keep for weeks. If wanted warm after that, put them in cold water, set on the fire, and take off when the water is warm.

</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose><alt synonym1="to make omelet">To make it.</alt></purpose></emph>--Always have a brisk fire to make an omelet; the quicker it is made the better, and the less <ingredient>butter</ingredient> it requires. If possible, have a frying-pan to make omelets only in; keep it in a clean place and never wash it if you can help it; by warming it a little before making the omelets and wiping it with a coarse towel, you can keep it as clean as can be without washing. To wash it causes the omelet to adhere to it while cooking, and injuries its appearance. Commence by beating the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> then put the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the frying-pan, about two ounces for eight <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> set on the fire and toss gently to melt the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> as evenly and as quickly as possible else some of it will get black before the whole is melted. As soon as melted, turn the beaten <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in, and stir and move continually with a fork or knife, so as to cook the whole as nearly as possible at the same time. If some part of the omelet sticks to the pan, add a little <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and raise that part with a knife so as to allow the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to run under it, and prevent it from sticking again. It must be done quickly, and without taking the pan from the fire. When cooked according to taste, soft or >hard, fold, dish, and serve warm.
</p>
<p>
It is 
<emph rend="italic">folded</emph> in this way: run the knife or fork under one part of the omelet, on the side nearest to the handle of the pan, and turn that part over the other part of the omelet, so as to double it or nearly so; then have an oval dish in your left hand, take hold of the frying-pan with the right hand, the thumb upward instead of the fingers, as is generally the case in taking hold of a pan, incline
<pb n="365" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=367"/>
the dish by raising the left side, place the edge of the pan (the one opposite to the handle) on the edge of the dish, turn it upside down-and you have the omelet on the dish, doubled up and sightly. Cooks do not succeed in turning out a decent omelet generally, because they cook it too much, turn it upside down in the pan, or because they do not know how to handle the pan.
</p>
<p>
In holding the pan as it is generally and naturally held, that is, with the palm of the hand resting on the upper side of the handle, it is impossible for anybody, cook or other, to dish the omelet properly without extraordinary efforts; while by resting the thumb on the upper part of the handle, the fingers under it, the little finger being the nearest to the pan, it is only necessary to move the right hand from right to left, describing a circle and twisting the wrist, so that, when the pan is turned upside down, the fingers are up instead of downward, as they were when taking hold of the pan.
</p>
<p>
An omelet is called soft if, when you commence to fold, only about two-thirds of the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are solidified; and hard, when nearly the whole of the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are solidified. With a good fire it takes only about four minutes to make an omelet.
</p>
<p>
By following our directions carefully, it will be very easy to make an omelet, and make it well and sightly, even the first time, and will be child's play to make one after a few days' practice.

<p>
THESE are served both as 
<emph rend="italic">entremets</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">dessert.</emph> Many are 
<emph rend="italic">entremets</emph> at a grand dinner, and 
<emph rend="italic">dessert</emph> at a family dinner. As the name indicates, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is one of the most important of the compounds used to prepare them. It is used in <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> the making of which is generally more difficult than the rest of the operation.
</p>
<p>
The 
<emph rend="italic">father of cooks,</emph> the great CAREME, divides <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> or the "cooking of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient>" as he calls it, and as every practitioner has called it since, into six degrees; each one corresponding to the six different states into which the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> passes, while on the fire, from the time it begins to boil to that when it begins to turn 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>caramel</ingredient></emph> or burned.
</p>
<p>
A copper pan is the best and handiest of all; it can be done in another, but it is more difficult; the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> turns brown before being thoroughly cooked or reduced. Always use good <ingredient>loaf sugar.</ingredient> If it be necessary to clarify it, do it in the following way: for five pounds of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> put the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> in a bowl with half a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and beat well with an egg-beater; then turn into it nearly three pints of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> stir, put away half a pint of it to be used afterward. Then add to the rest five pounds of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> in
<pb n="377" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=379"/>
lumps, set on a rather slow fire, and as soon as it comes to a boil, mix with it the half pint put away, little by little, skimming off carefully the while, and when no more scum gathers on the surface, strain through a towel and commence the working. If the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> does not require to be clarified, that is, when it is good <ingredient>white sugar,</ingredient> set five pounds of it on the fire, in a copper pan, with nearly two quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and skim off carefully as soon as the scum gathers. It may be stirred a little to cause the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to melt evenly, but as soon as it commences to boil, stop stirring, else it will turn <ingredient>white</ingredient> and stringy. It passes from one state or degree to another in a very short time, and must be watched closely. It is at the 
<emph rend="italic">first</emph> degree when, by dipping a piece of wood into it so as to retain a drop of it at the end, and which you touch with another piece of wood-if, by pulling them apart, slowly and immediately, insteaad of separating it at once, it forms a thread, but that soon breaks. It marks then 34 at the hydrometer. It is at the 
<emph rend="italic">second</emph> degree when, by repeating the same process, the kind of thread formed does not break as easily as the first. It marks then 36. It is at the 
<emph rend="italic">third</emph> degree when, by dipping a skimmer in it, holding it horizontally and striking it on the pan, then blowing on it, it forms small bubbles. It marks 39 at the hydrometer. It is at the 
<emph rend="italic">fourth</emph> degree by trying again with the skimmer after a short time, and when, instead of forming bubbles, it will fly away like threads. It marks then 41. The 
<emph rend="italic">fifth</emph> degree is when, by dipping a piece of wood in the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and quickly dipping it also in a bowl of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> shaking it at the same time and then biting it; if it breaks easily between the teeth, but at the same time is sticky, it has attained the fifth degree, and marks 44. A few boilings more and it is at the 
<emph rend="italic">sixth</emph> degree, and by trying in the
<pb n="378" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=380"/>
same way as the preceding one, it will break under the teeth, but will not stick to them. Above 44 the mark is uncertain, the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> being too thick; it passes from that state to that of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>caramel;</ingredient></emph> is colored, and would burn immediately. When that happens, make <ingredient>burnt sugar</ingredient> with it according to direction.

<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Glazed Fruit--Oranges glazed.</purpose></emph>--<ingredient>Oranges</ingredient> or any other <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> glazed, when mounted in a pyramid, is called 
<emph rend="italic">croque en bouche.</emph>
</p>
<p>
Peel the <ingredient>oranges;</ingredient> then divide the carpels and free them from the pith, and put them away in a warm place for a few hours; they may be left over night. Cut very fine wire in pieces about eight inches long, bend each piece at both ends, forming a hook; then run one end or hook through the carpel of <ingredient>orange,</ingredient> and hang it on a stick placed on something horizontally. In order not to spill any of the <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> hook the <ingredient>orange</ingredient> near the edge of that part that was the centre of the <ingredient>orange</ingredient> before being divided, and as the other end of the wire forms a hook also, it is easy to hang it.
</p>
<p>
Prepare <ingredient>syrup of sugar,</ingredient> and when at the sixth degree
<pb n="395" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=397"/>
take it from the fire, dip each carpel of <ingredient>orange</ingredient> into it and hang it again, and so on for the whole. As soon as dry enough to handle them, which takes hardly half a minute, pull off the wire and serve when perfectly cold.
</p>
<p>
To mount them in pyramid is not difficult, but requires time. When they are cold, prepare again the same <ingredient>syrup of sugar</ingredient> as above, and take it from the fire. While the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is on the fire take a tin mould, a plain one, larger at the top than at the bottom, and slightly <ingredient>grease</ingredient> it with <ingredient>sweet-oil.</ingredient> A convenient size for a family is, seven inches high, six inches broad at the top, and only four inches at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Place one carpel of <ingredient>orange,</ingredient> resting on the bottom of the mould, along the side and the edge upward; as soon as the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is out of the fire, dip one of the two ends of another carpel into it, the edge only, and immediately place it as the first one, and touching it. The <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> being hot and liquid, the two pieces will adhere; do the same with others till you have one row around the bottom. Commence a second row as you did the first, but this time the first carpel you place must be dipped in <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> in order to adhere to the first row, and all the others must also be dipped so as to adhere not only to the first piece placed, but also to the first row; and so on for each row till the mould is full, or till you have as much as you wish. As soon as cold, place a dish on the mould, turn upside down, and remove the mould. You have then a sightly dish, but not better than when served only glazed.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Another way to make it.</emph>--<ingredient>Grease</ingredient> with <ingredient>oil</ingredient> your marble for pastry, place the same mould as above over it but upside down, that is, the broader end down; <ingredient>grease</ingredient> the outside also with <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> Then place the rows of carpels of <ingredient>oranges</ingredient> all around outside of it, and in the same way as
<pb n="396" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=398"/>
described above. The 
<emph rend="italic">croque en bouche</emph> is more easily made this last way, but it is more difficult to remove the mould. Mould and <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> must be turned upside down carefully, after which the mould is pulled off.
</p>
<p>
If the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> gets cold, it hardens, and cannot be used; in that state, add a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> and put it back on the fire, but it is difficult to rewarm it; generally it colors and is unfit. When that happens, make <ingredient>burnt sugar</ingredient> with it, or a 
<emph rend="italic">nougat.</emph> It is better and safer to make a little of it, just what can be used before it gets cold, and if not enough, make some a second and even a third time. While the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is hot, and while you are dipping the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> in it, be careful not to touch it, as it burns badly. In glazing the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> first, some <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> falls in taking it from the pan to the stick; place your marble board, greased with <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> under, so that you can pick it without any trouble and use it.

<chapter class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">PASTRY.</hd>
<p>
OF all the branches of the science and art of cooking, pastry, if not the most difficult, requires the greatest care. An inferior piece of meat makes an inferior dish, but still it can be eaten without danger: but inferior pastry can hardly be eaten; or, if eaten, it is indigestible. We will recommend our readers to be very careful about proportions; it would not make a great difference for some kinds, but for others, putting too much or too little of one or more things would certainly result in failure. It is very important to have good materials. New flour is very inferior for pastry; it must have been ground for at least three months. Always keep it in bags, and in a dry and well-ventilated place. Sift before using it. Use fresh eggs, good butter, and good pulverized sugar.
</p>
<p>
The most important of all is the oven, for, supposing that you have used good materials, have mixed them well, if not properly baked, every thing is lost, materials and labor. Supposing that you have a good oven, there is still a difficulty-and if the last, not the least-the degree of heat. Some require a quick oven, as puff-paste, 
<emph rend="italic">choux,</emph> etc.; others a warm one, and others a slow oven, as 
<emph rend="italic">meringues,</emph> <ingredient>biscuits,</ingredient> etc. By putting the hand in the oven you can tell if it is properly heated, but it requires experience,
<pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=412"/>
and even practitioners are often mistaken; therefore, the easiest way is to have a thermometer in the oven. It may be placed in the oven of every stove or range; it is only necessary to bore a hole on the top of the range or stove, reaching the oven, and have a thermometer with the bulb inclosed in a brass sheath, perforated, long enough to reach the oven, and of the size of the hole bored-the glass tube being above the top of the range.
</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Pastes.</purpose></emph>--There are several kinds of paste. Puff-paste is the most important; it can be made very rich, rich, and less so; and several hundred different cakes can be made with it. Small cakes are called 
<emph rend="italic">petits fours.</emph>
</p>
<p>
The next in importance is the 
<emph rend="italic">p&#226;te-&#224;-choux;</emph> then the paste for meat-pies, sometimes called 
<emph rend="italic">p&#226;te bris&#233;e.</emph>
</p>
<p>
Puff-paste requires care, but is easily made; 
<emph rend="italic">p&#226;te-&#224;-choux</emph> must be well worked.
</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Puff-paste.</purpose></emph>--To make good <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> good <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> free from <ingredient>salt</ingredient> or <ingredient>sour milk,</ingredient> are indispensable. It must be made in a cool place. Take half a pound of good <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and knead it well in a bowl of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> if fresh and not <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> the kneading will take the <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> out of it; if salty, it will remove the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then put it in another bowl of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and leave it till it is perfectly firm, and then use. When the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is ready, put half a pound of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the paste-board or marble, make a hole in it, in which you put a pinch of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> enough to make a rather stiff dough. It requires about half a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> knead well, make a kind of ball with the dough, and put it on a corner of your marble or paste-board, Take the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> from the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and knead it on the broad, to press all the <ingredient>water</ingredient> out of it. Give it the shape of a large <ingredient>sausage;</ingredient> dredge the board slightly with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> roll the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> over only once, as it must take very
<pb n="411" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=413"/>
little of it, dredge both ends of the piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> also, then by putting one end on the board and pressing on the other end with your hands, you will flatten it of a rather round shape, and till of about half an inch in thickness. Put it thus on the corner of the board also. Immediately after having prepared the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> take the dough and roll it down, of a round form also, and till large enough to envelop the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in it easily. Remember that during the whole operation of folding and rolling the paste down, you must dust the marbele or pasteboard with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> very slightly and often; do the same on the top of the <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> It is done in order to prevent the paste from adhering to the board or to the rolling-pin. It must be dusted slightly, so that the paste cannot absorb much of it, as it would make it tough. Have a slab of marble or slate; it is much easier than wood, and cooler.
</p>
<p>
When the dough is spread, place the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> right on the middle of it. Turn one side of the dough over the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> covering it a little more than half way; do the same with the opposite side, the dough lapping over that of the first side turned; do the same with the side toward you, and also with the side opposite. Dough stretching easily when pulled, and contracting easily when let loose after having pulled it, you have now still four corners of the dough to bring over the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and in the same way as above, and by doing which, you give to the whole a somewhat round form, and also have the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> perfectly enveloped in the dough. Place the rolling-pin on the middle of the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> horizontally, and press gently on it so as to make a furrow; do the same from place to place, on the whole surface, making furrows about an inch apart. Repeat the process again, this time placing the rolling-pin right on the top of each elevated line; and again, repeat
<pb n="412" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=414"/>
it a third time, also placing the pin on each elevated line. Now do exactly the same contrariwise. Then, roll the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> down, gently, evenly, to a thickness of about one fourth of an inch, and of a rectangular shape. Fold it in three by turning over one-third of its length toward the other end, and thus covering another third of it; fold or turn over the remaining third, so as to cover the first third turned over. Roll it down again of about the same thickness as above, but without making furrows in it; give it also the same rectangular shape, taking care to make the length of what was the width, 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> extending it the longer way in an opposite direction to that of the first time, so that the ends will be what the sides were. Fold in three as before, put it on a plate and set in a refrigerator for from ten to twenty minutes. Take hold of it again, roll down as above, fold in the same way also, and put away for ten minutes. You roll down and fold from four to six times, not counting the time you envelop the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the dough. In cold weather, and when the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is firm, fold and roll only four times; but in rather warm weather, fold and roll six times. If it is too warm, it is of no use to try with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient>

<p>
<ingredient>Puff-paste</ingredient> may be made without stopping; that is, without putting it away in a cool place for some time; but it is better to let it rest; it is lighter and rises better. When finished, it can be used immediately; but it is better also to put it in a plate or dish, cover it with a towel, and put it in a refrigerator for from twelve to twenty-four hours. Although it must be kept in a cool place, do not put it near enough to the ice to freeze. It may be kept thus for two or three days.

<p>
The proportion of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> may be varied. Weight for weight makes the real puff-paste, and very rich. If less <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is used it will not rise as much, but is excellent nevertheless, and is more handy to make different cakes, such as short-cakes with <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> Therefore puff-paste may be made with the following proportions: to one pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> use fourteen, twelve, ten, eight, or even four ounces of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> Another way is to mix one or two <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> before rolling it down.

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>Vol-au-vent.</purpose></emph>--A 
<emph rend="italic">vol-au-vent</emph> is made with <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient> and filled with <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> etc., when baked; that is, when the cake is baked and emptied, it is warmed in the oven, filled, and served warm. It is made of an oval or round shape. When made small it is generally of a round shape, but when made rather large it is generally of an oval shape. When the <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient> is ready to be used, roll down to any thickness from one-quarter to three-quarters of an inch; cut it with a sharp-pointed knife of the size and shape you wish, then with the same knife cut what is called the cover, 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> make a cut all around, about half an inch from the edge or border, and about one-third through the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> leaving two-thirds of the thickness of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> uncut. This operation is called marking out the cover. Glaze the top of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> with <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and bake it in a very quick oven, about 500 deg. Fahr. In glazing, be careful not to glaze the sides or allow any <ingredient>egg</ingredient> to run on the sides; it would prevent the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> from rising. Some drawings may be made on the cover with the back of a knife, according to fancy: leaves, for instance, are very easily imitated; it is only necessary to run the knife on the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> without cutting it. When in the oven, do not look at it for at least seven or eight minutes, for in opening the door of the oven it might cause the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> to fall, and even after that time open and shut the door quickly; take off when properly baked. When the oven is hot enough, it takes about twelve minutes, and even less time when the 
<emph rend="italic">vol-au-vent</emph> is small.
<pb n="418" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=420"/>
Take from the oven when baked, and immediately run the point of the knife all around and in the same place as you did before being baked, which place is well marked. Thus you cut off the cover and remove it, then remove also all the unbaked <ingredient>paste</ingredient> that is inside of the 
<emph rend="italic">vol-au-vent,</emph> so that you have left what may be called a shell. Keep it then till the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> or <ingredient>meat</ingredient> are ready to put in it. About five minutes before the filling is ready, put the shell or baked <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in a slow oven to warm it, turn the filling into it, enough to fill it entirely; place the cover on the top, and serve warm. The unbaked <ingredient>paste</ingredient> removed from the inside is baked, and makes an excellent cake, though not a sightly one.

<p>
<emph rend="italic">Another.</emph>--Cut a piece of <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient> the same as for the above one, that is, either round or oval, and of the size you wish. Instead of marking a cover, glaze the border with <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> It is understood here by "the border," a space about three-quarters of an inch broad and all around it, the space being measured from the edge toward the centre. Then cut a strip of <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient> about three-quarters of an inch broad, long enough to cover the place or space glazed, which strip you put all around the first <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> and you then have a border. The place between the two pastes being glazed, they will adhere in baking. Then also glaze the upper side of the border carefully with <ingredient>egg.</ingredient> With a knife or fork, prick the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> inside of the border only, in ten, fifteen, or twenty places, according to the size of the 
<emph rend="italic">vol-au-vent,</emph> and in order to prevent that part from rising as much as it would if not pricked. Bake in the same oven as the above--a very quick one.

When properly done, nothing at all sticks to the pan, and by touching it with the finger it feels as soft as velvet, and does not adhere to it at all. Let it stand two or three minutes, then mix well with it, by means of a spoon, one <ingredient>egg;</ingredient> then another, and so on; in all four. It takes some time and work to mix the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> especially to mix the first one, the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> being rather stiff.

Let the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> stand half an hour, stir again a little, and use.

<purpose>PUDDINGS.</purpose>--Puddings are made of several materials and in a hundred different ways. Some are cooked by boiling, others are baked, and some are both boiled and baked. Puddings for inhabitants of cities ought to be made as light as possible. For persons working outside and at manual labor, it does not matter, because their food passes through the system in a short time. It is very well known that the poorer class of Americans eat too much pudding and pie. Many do it for economy, others for convenience. The former are mistaken, and the
<pb n="443" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=445"/>
latter are blamable. Puddings and pies cost more in the end than meat properly and carefully prepared. We do not mean to do away with them entirely, but we advise every one to do with puddings as with every thing else, "use, but do not abuse." "Pies, cakes, and sweetmeats, are universally known to be poisoning to children, and the mothers who give them are conscious that they are purchasing the momentary smile of satisfaction at the risk of after-sickness, and perhaps of incurable disease."--PETER PARLEY.
</p>
<p>
The above needs no commentary; we only recommend it to the consideration of young mothers.
</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p>
<emph rend="italic"><purpose>For Convenience.</purpose></emph>--We have taken the trouble to put questions about it to over three hundred mothers, wives of mechanics or of employ&#233;s at a comparatively small salary, and we are sorry to say, that more than ninety per cent. gave us about the same answer--they make and cook cakes in one day, enough to feed the whole family for three days, to save the trouble of cooking every day. We cannot see where the trouble can be for a good wife and mother to prepare her husband and children's dinner.

Pudding-eating is an English custom; but, before following a custom of another country, people ought to consider if that custom or fashion (whatever it is) has not been introduced into that country by necessity, which is the case of pudding-eating in England and in some parts of Holland.
</p>
<p>
In England, where the fog is nearly perpetual, the stomach requires to be filled with something heavy, something that will stay there till the next meal, and very often longer than that.
</p>
<p>
It is well known that in England farm hands, or other persons working in the open air, eat six times a day, and
<pb n="444" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=446"/>
have pudding at least three times; they drink home-brewed beer, which is very heavy, and very rich also. Let any one here, in this pure, clear atmosphere, eat six times a day, have pudding three times, with a pint of home-brewed beer every time, and see how he will feel in the evening. We beg all, who may doubt our observations, to try the experiment.
</p>
<p>
Pastry in general, no matter how light it may be made, lies heavier on the stomach than any other food, and is very difficult of digestion. There are thousands of persons that have never had any indigestion but of pastry. Children like pastry very much; this is easily understood; as their young stomachs digest very rapidly, they crave food oftener than grown persons. Pastry being easier to have at any time than anything else, it is given to them; and from habit in youth arises the liking when grown up. The stomach, being accustomed to it from infancy, may digest it better, but it is always at the expense of the whole system; the stomach must work hard, too hard in digesting it; whence come dyspepsia, weakness, and finally consumption, or debility, or any other sickness of the same kind.

<purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BREAD.</purpose> It is next to an impossibility to bake <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in a small oven; half the time the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is too much or not enough baked. In cities, where good baker's <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can be bought, it comes as cheap as it can be made at home, if not cheaper,
<pb n="455" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=457"/>
and saves a great deal of time and labor. It is not difficult to make good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> with good <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> There are several ways of making and of using <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> Some are better than others; but many, though differently manipulated, bring about the same results. The only difficulty is the baking of it. Bakers can almost always bake <ingredient>bread</ingredient> properly, having large brick ovens. If they do not bake their <ingredient>bread</ingredient> enough, which is generally the case, it is not because they cannot, but because under-baked <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is heavier, and people, especially the poorer class, buy it in preference to the other; judging by the weight, they think they have more of it for a certain sum of money. Under-baked <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is difficult of digestion. 
<emph rend="italic">(See</emph> FOOD.)
</p>
<p>
The best <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is made with the best <ingredient>wheat-flour,</ingredient> all that can be said by anybody to the contrary notwithstanding. <ingredient>Rye,</ingredient> <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> and <ingredient>barley bread</ingredient> are excellent, and may be partaken of by those whose constitution, occupation, etc., allow it. In every thing, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> included, the people, or what may be called "the million," are wiser than 
<emph rend="italic">soi-di-sant</emph> philosophers; and if <ingredient>oat-meal</ingredient> or <ingredient>Indian-meal</ingredient> were better than <ingredient>wheat-flour,</ingredient> they would be dearer. To describe or discuss the innumerable methods of making <ingredient>bread</ingredient> would require several volumes. We have perused carefully hundreds of them; they nearly all differ theoretically, but practically, when practical (which is not always the case), they amount to about the same thing. We think that the only difficulty, if difficulty there be, is in the use of the <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> the making of the same, and the baking. Chemical processes for rising will never equal the processes of nature and time. Many bakers do not use the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> properly, their bread being sour or musty; some sweeten their bread, to disguise an inferior quality of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> or as an antidote to sourness or mustiness.
</p>
<pb n="456" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=458"/>
<p>
<ingredient>Bread</ingredient> gets dry after a while, and is inferior in quality and taste. The lighter the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> the better, although many do not think so. The belief may come from the fact that the lighter <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is the more porous, and therefore the quicker it evaporates and loses its taste. Warm <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> besides being injurious to the teeth, is difficult of digestion. When perfectly cold, let it stand in a dry place, neither cold nor warm, for one or two hours, and use. We give below the best methods of making <ingredient>bread</ingredient>--French <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or rather good light <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> for we do not see that it is more French or Chinese or American, as long as it can be made everywhere with good <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> it is certainly the best for inhabitants of a large city, and especially for those having a sedentary occupation. Let us apply the proverb to <ingredient>bread</ingredient> as well as to every thing else: "Feed me with food convenient for me."--<emph rend="italic">Bible.</emph>

Mix well together one gill of good strong <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> with half a pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> so that it makes a rather stiff <ingredient>paste.</ingredient> Knead so that you shape it like a ball. Make two cuts with a knife on the top, across and about one-quarter of an inch deep; then place the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in a bowl of tepid <ingredient>water</ingredient> (<ingredient>milk</ingredient>-warm), the cuts upward. After it has been in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a few minutes it will float and swell; let it float about two minutes, when take off and use. Put six ounces of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the paste-board, and make a hole in the middle; put into it the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> prepared as above, tepid <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to make an ordinary dough, and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to taste.

Then add and mix with it half a pint of good <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and put away in the same place for about nine hours. It may take a little longer than nine hours or a little less, but it is very easy to know, and in this way: after a while it will rise slowly and gradually for some time, and then begin to fall; as soon as it begins to fall, mix a little tepid <ingredient>water</ingredient> with it and strain through a sieve; throw away <ingredient>potato skins</ingredient> and eyes; mix what is strained with two pounds of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and tepid <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to make an ordinary dough. Put it away again in the same place until it cracks on the top, which will take place in about an hour. Then put six pounds of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the paste-board, and make a hole in the middle; put into it a little tepid <ingredient>water</ingredient> and the dough when cracked; knead the whole well with <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to make an ordinary dough, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to taste.

When the dough is thus elongated, take a round stick or a small rolling-pin, place it on the top of the dough, right on the middle, lengthwise, and then press on it and roll just a little, to and fro, so as to make a kind of furrow in the middle.

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger">BILLS OF FARE.</hd>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Dinner-Time.</emph>--On account of the various occupations of members of the same family, this is often the first and only time of the day that sees them all assembled. It is the dinner that mostly supplies the waste that the system has undergone for twenty-four hours. Being taken after the day's work is over, it gives to the stomach time to digest (mind and stomach never working at the same time). 
<emph rend="italic">(See</emph> FOOD, ECONOMY, <ingredient>COFFEE,</ingredient> AND <ingredient>TEA.</ingredient>)
</p>
<p>
The dinner, being the most substantial meal of the day, requires more preparation than any other meal; the bill of fare of it should, therefore, be made the day before, or at least early in the morning. It should always be made between the mistress or master of the house and the cook; written and hung in the kitchen, near the clock. The first thing to put down is what may be left from the preceding day, and also what may be in the larder; then what is wanted in butcher's meat or poultry, or both; the fish or game, or both, and which, with vegetables, are according to the market. It is then one of the duties of the cook to make a list of what is wanted as accessories; such as flour, eggs, sugar, spices, etc.
</p>
<pb n="460" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=462"/>
<p>
Besides the above, it is also the duty of the cook to send the dishes to the table in their regular order; for, if the whole dinner is sent at once, all the dishes have to be eaten at once also, else the last get cold and are unpalatable, or, by mixing them, they are rendered tasteless, as the flavor of one neutralizes (if it does not destroy) the taste of another.
</p>
<p>
To make models of bills of fare is not difficult, but to follow them is nearly impossible; hardly one in a hundred would suit any one.
</p>
<p>
Bills of fare vary according to the season of the year, and therefore to the produce in the market.
</p>
<p>
We will try to give another, and we think a better way of making them to suit everybody, every purse, and at any time.
</p>
<p>
A dinner, no matter how grand, is composed of three courses, and seven kinds of dishes.
</p>
<p>
The first course comprises dishes of four kinds, viz.: potages, 
<emph rend="italic">hors-d'&#x153;uvres, relev&#233;s, and entr&#233;es.</emph>
</p>
<p>
The second course comprises dishes of two kinds, viz.: 
<emph rend="italic">rots</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">entremets.</emph>
</p>
<p>
The third course comprises dishes of one kind, the dessert.
</p>
<p>
The number of dishes of each kind is generally according to the number of guests.
</p>
<p>
It may also be according to the importance of the occasion for which the dinner is given; to the honor the giver or givers wish to show the personage or personages invited; to the amount of money they are willing to spend, etc.
</p>
<p>
The following table shows how many dishes of each kind are to be served at dinner to a certain number of persons:

The above table shows the number of dishes, but more than one dish of the same kind can be served; for instance, four kinds of potages, 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s,</emph> etc., are served for forty; but two or four dishes of each kind can be served.
</p>
<p>
The size of the 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">r&#244;ts</emph> should be according to the number of guests.
</p>
<p>
It is just as easy to select dishes for a small family-dinner as for a grand one; two, three, four, or more dishes can be selected; for instance, you select a potage, an 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;e</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">r&#244;t,</emph> or both, one vegetable or a sweet dish, or both; and one or as many plates of dessert as you please.
</p>
<p>
Have a bouquet on the middle of the table, if possible, or at least a basket of fruit. Flowers during dinner have the same effect as music after it; they soften the manners, and gently and sweetly gratify the senses.
</p>
<p>
To simplify and render the making of bills of fare easy, we have divided the different dishes into seven parts, each part being in the order the dishes of which must be served, and representing the seven kinds of dishes composing a dinner. By this means you select the dish or dishes which suit you, and which you can procure in any or all of the seven parts, and your bill of fare is made, and more to your liking than any steward on earth can do.

<emph rend="italic">Relev&#233;s.--Relev&#233;s</emph> are composed of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and large pieces of <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> A <ingredient>fish</ingredient> served whole is always a 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;;</emph> in pieces, it is an 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;e.</emph> Pieces of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>pork,</ingredient></emph> roasted, are always served as 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s.</emph> At a family dinner the 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;</emph> is almost always a <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> The other pieces of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> that are served as 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s</emph> are: 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>bear,</ingredient> buffalo,</emph> boiled and corned 
<emph rend="italic">beef, <ingredient>leg</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">saddle</emph> of <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">quarters</emph> of <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> large pieces of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>veal;</ingredient></emph> also all 
<emph rend="italic">vol-au-vent</emph> of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and of <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">bouche&#233;s</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish-pies.</ingredient></emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Fourth part,</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">Entr&#233;es.</emph>--These comprise every dish of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>meat,</ingredient></emph> except poultry and <ingredient>game,</ingredient> when roasted; every
<pb n="463" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=465"/>
dish of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish</ingredient></emph> not served whole; also 
<emph rend="italic">p&#226;t&#233;s de foies gras, sour-krout, snails, <ingredient>meat-pies,</ingredient> terrines, pains</emph> of <ingredient>game</ingredient> and of poultry. The dishes of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>meat</ingredient></emph> mentioned in the 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s</emph> may be served as 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es</emph> at a family dinner. The order of the dishes is described above.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Fifth part,</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">R&#244;ts.--Poultry, <ingredient>game,</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish.</ingredient></emph> At a family dinner, 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>lamb</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>veal</ingredient></emph> are often served as roasted pieces, especially at seasons when there is no <ingredient>game,</ingredient> and poultry is scarce.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Sixth part,</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">Entremets.</emph>--The following are served as 
<emph rend="italic">entremets:</emph> all 
<emph rend="italic">salads</emph> of greens; all dishes of 
<emph rend="italic">vegetables,</emph> of 
<emph rend="italic">omeletes,</emph> except four, viz., with <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> and <ingredient>kidneys.</ingredient> Also dishes of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>macaroni,</ingredient></emph> of 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>rice,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> &#224; la neige,</emph> all 
<emph rend="italic">sweet dishes</emph> (sweet dishes are also served as 
<emph rend="italic">dessert</emph>), and 
<emph rend="italic">cakes;</emph> such as 
<emph rend="italic">baba, brioche, g&#233;noises, madeleines, savarin,</emph> and sponge-cake.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Seventh part,</emph> or 
<emph rend="italic">Dessert.</emph>--The dessert comprises ripe 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> sweet dishes</emph> (these are also served as 
<emph rend="italic">entremets,</emph> according to taste), 
<emph rend="italic">pastry</emph> (except <ingredient>meat</ingredient>-pies, 
<emph rend="italic">terrines,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">pains,) salads</emph> of <ingredient>fruits,</ingredient> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>cheese.</ingredient></emph> The latter is always served the first 
<emph rend="italic">(see</emph> CHEESE). After <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> there is no rule for serving the other plates of dessert; it is according to each one's taste.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Punch</emph> is served after the 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es</emph> or after the 
<emph rend="italic">relev&#233;s</emph> of <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> according to taste.
</p>
</section>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Early Breakfast.</emph>--We are of opinion that everybody ought to eat as little <ingredient>meat</ingredient> as possible, and drink no <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> <ingredient>beer,</ingredient> or any other liquor at an early breakfast, no matter what the sex or age may be, except when prescribed by the physician in case of sickness, debility, etc. The food may be selected from the following: 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>bread</ingredient></emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> omelets,</emph> fried 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish,</ingredient></emph> fried 
<emph rend="italic">vegetables, sardines,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fruit,</ingredient></emph> according to the season.
</p>
<pb n="464" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=hand&#38;PageNum=466"/>
<p>
As for <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> in case it should be eaten, it ought to be cold, such as <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> cooked the day before.
</p>
<p>
Muffins, and other cakes or pastes, served warm, are very bad for the stomach and teeth.
</p>
<p>
The beverage ought to be either <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> <ingredient>cocoa,</ingredient> <ingredient>choca,</ingredient> or <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> but do not by any means drink <ingredient>tea</ingredient> at breakfast; it is too astringent.
</p>
<p>
Although <ingredient>cold meat</ingredient> is not by far so injurious as warm <ingredient>meat</ingredient> for breakfast, it ought, nevertheless, to be as little partaken of as possible, and especially by the young.
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Late Breakfast, Lunch, Tea, and early Supper.</emph>--At these meals the following dishes may be served:
</p>
<p>
Every dish served as a 
<emph rend="italic">h&#244;rs-d'&#x153;uvre, <ingredient>calf's</ingredient></emph> <ingredient>head</ingredient> and <ingredient>feet,</ingredient> <ingredient>bear</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>hams,</ingredient> <ingredient>head-cheese,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs</ingredient></emph> cooked in any way, 
<emph rend="italic">omelets, <ingredient>mutton</ingredient></emph> chops, 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>veal</ingredient></emph> cutlets, fried 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish,</ingredient></emph> ripe 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fruit,</ingredient></emph> boned 
<emph rend="italic">birds, <ingredient>ham,</ingredient></emph> cold 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>meat</ingredient></emph> of any kind, 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> p&#226;t&#233; de foies gras, salads</emph> of <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> or any other birds, and of <ingredient>lobster,</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">sandwiches, sardines,</emph> fried 
<emph rend="italic">vegetables, sweet dishes,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">pastry.</emph>
</p>
<p>
<emph rend="italic">Late Supper.</emph>--This being the last meal taken before retiring, persons should be careful about what they eat then, especially those who take no bodily exercise, or retire soon after it. Some are not aware that their rest depends nearly, if not entirely, on what they have eaten at supper. The lighter the food the better; such as fried 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fish,</ingredient> sardines, lait de poule, bavaroise,</emph> well-ripened 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>fruit,</ingredient></emph> a 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>cream,</ingredient></emph> a little 
<emph rend="italic">iced <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> <ingredient>fruit-jelly,</ingredient> <ingredient>prunes,</ingredient></emph> etc.
</p>
<p>
The gastronomical or hygienic rule to be observed in eating, it will be seen, is therefore, after the soup and 
<emph rend="italic">h&#244;rs-d'&#x153;uvres,</emph> to commence with the heaviest or most substantial dishes, and to finish with the lightest. The rule is just the opposite for wines. Here we must commence with the lightest, and end with those which contain the most alcohol,and are consequently the heaviest.
