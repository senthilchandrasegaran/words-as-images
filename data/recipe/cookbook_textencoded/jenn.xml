<hd align="center">INTRODUCTION</hd>
<p>"Why another cook-book, when there are already so many?"</p>
<p>Well, for several reasons, one of which is, that when an inquiry was made for a good, practical cook-book, we knew not which to recommend. We examined a great many, and found some good for one thing, and some for another; but few containing just what young, middle class housekeepers want to know--arranged in a clear, available form, unencumbered with unnecessary and wordy details.</p>
<p>A very small number of the printed cookery and housekeeping books have been written by women, and still less by persons possessing any practical knowledge of the subject of which they were treating. The majority are clumsy compilations of all kinds of receipts--good, bad, and indifferent, collected from various sources, and put together with an ignorance as profound, of their results, as if they had been written in an unknown language.</p>
<p>There are certain "high art" cookery books that are very good and complete, in their way; but they are too elaborate and pretentious for the class for whom this was written. They go into the mysteries of French dishes, and tell how to get up grand dinners, but they leave the poor young wife, who wants to cook a chop or a chicken, 
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=12"/>
stuff a piece of veal, and make a pudding, or a loaf of bread for the first time in her life, quite in the dark.</p>
<p>It is not claimed for the present volume, by the author, that it fully meets the necessities of the case, or has satisfactorily accomplished its task, even within the modest limits assigned to it. It is one thing to think how something may be done, and another thing to do it; but it is claimed that the object of the work has been constantly kept in view, that it has been executed lovingly, with a strong appreciation of the benefit and pleasure to be derived from good cooking, from the intermingling of the finer with the grosser elements, with a pleasant remembrance of good times spent in the kitchen, and with an earnest wish to make these duties seem attractive to the conscientious young wives who would willingly perform their part, if they but knew how.</p>
<p>Nearly all the receipts and recommendations in the following pages have been carefully tested and found sensible and practical. We have omitted some things, which nearly all cook-books contain, such as directions for carving, setting table, etc.; because it seemed a waste of valuable space. Carving is partly a gift of nature, and partly of grace; it is never learned from a book. Directions of this kind, moreover, are useless without illustrations; and these did not come within the scope of the present work. Information as to how to put the knives and forks on a dinner table is another work of supererogation. Few persons who use a cookery book are so benighted as not to have seen a table neatly set sometime or other, and if they have, it is worth more to them than a dozen printed rules. Young housekeepers will, however, find a great many hints,--the result of experience and observation,--which we hope will prove useful to them, and help to keep 
 
<pb n="vii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=13"/>
them from the errors and perplexities of many who have preceded them.</p>
<p>Dear friends,--for it is you, for whom this book is written, and to whom it is dedicated,--I believe in you, I sympathize with you, because I am one of you. I see you in your lovely young wife-hood, so happy in your treasures of pantry and closet, so proud of your first culinary success, and of your lord and master's high appreciation of it; and I would, if it were possible, extend the loving halo which glorifies every act of affection during these first happy months, to all your future; so that no weariness, no pain, no distrust, no loss of anything that now makes life beautiful, might ever come near you. But this is out of my power. I can only wish for every one no more clouds than is necessary, to vary and make beautiful the matrimonial sky, and so dear friends,</p>
<p align="right">FAREWELL.</p>

<hd align="center">TO THE READER</hd>
<p>A NEW edition gives me the opportunity to add a chapter to this little work, which, I hope, will give it additional interest and value, and also to offer a word of apology and explanation to my readers.</p>
<p>A longer experience has demonstrated one error, which is of such importance to young mothers that I desire to correct it here. This is in regard to <emph rend="italic">diluting</emph> milk, in the chapter upon Food for Infants. If cow's milk is used as a substitute for mother's milk, I believe now, from experience and observation, that it is best to get the best from one cow, and use it <emph rend="italic">pure.</emph> The child is better nourished on a much smaller quantity than when it is diluted, and is much less liable to flatulence and colic. Sweeten the milk slightly with powdered sugar, and warm it by putting the bottle in water, which should be gradually heated. I may remark, however, that my faith in prepared barley, as food for infants, has been strengthened, and I am very glad it is rapidly being brought into general use.</p>
<p>All that I have to say in regard to the receipts contained in the additional chapter is, that they are genuine, and were obtained directly, excepting in one instance, (where it was furnished by a friend,) from the parties themselves. All that I have to beg of young housekeepers is, that they will try them with their own hands, and not turn them over to the tender mercies of Bridget. It is not the personal extravagance of American women that is sapping the foundation of American homes. It is the disintegrating quality of our domestic service.</p>

<hd align="center">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COOKING.</hd>
<list><item>1. The object of cooking is to make food healthful, and palatable; the secret is therefore, how to combine elements and flavors, so as to produce the best results.</item>
<item>2. The best meat requires the simplest preparation.</item>
<item>3. A cardinal principle in cooking is cleanliness; a dirty cook cannot be a good cook, because all her dishes, no matter how distinct in quality, or costly in material, will taste as if, to use a common expression, they were "cooked in one pot."</item>
<item>4. As a general rule, to which there are very few exceptions, cook long and slowly, to cook well, and let the heat reach every part as evenly as possible.</item>
<item>5. Fresh meats, and fish are better than corned, pickled, or smoked provisions; and the flesh of grown animals, (beef or mutton) is to be preferred to young beasts, such as veal or lamb.</item>
<item>6. The natural order in cooking meats or fish, excepting oysters, is first to broil, second to boil, third to roast, fourth to stew, fifth to bake, and sixth to fry; and never to fry, as long as there is another method left.</item>
<item>7. To retain the juices in boiled meat, keep it in mass and plunge it in boiling water; this coagulates the outer coating and prevents the escape of the jucies, or soluable matter. To extract the jucies for soup, cut it up in small pieces, and put it in cold water; this draws out all the strength, making good soup, but poor meat.</item>
<item>8. Air should have access to roasting meat, hence spit roasting before a fire, is found much better than roasting in a closed oven.</item>
<item>9. Always retain as much as possible of the distinct flavor of every article of food used; mixtures which make all dishes taste alike, are dyspepsia breeding, as well as appetite killing.</item>
<item>10. Carefully avoid placing articles in contact, which have no 
 
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=16"/>
affinity, such as fish and meat, etc. It is sufficient for people to do that in their stomachs.</item>
<item>11. A light hand in making, a quick step in baking, maketh a good conscience for eating bread, puddings, and pies.</item>
<item>12. Food for the well, is better than physic for the sick. Bad cooking is a crime; it is the cause of dyspepsia, and a host of other evils. A woman convicted of it ought to be arrainged for manslaughter.</item>

<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=17"/>
<hd align="center">HOUSEKEEPING.</hd>
<p>The great question when a young couple are going to be married is, whether they shall keep house or board. The gentleman, as a general rule, wishes to keep house, he is tired of boarding; moreover, he had anticipated so much enjoyment in a snug little house of their own, and so much pride and pleasure in seeing his pretty Nellie at the head of his table, doing the honors to the choicest of his friends.</p>
<p>But Nellie has quite different ideas; in the first place, she knows nothing about cooking. She has, with the help of her mother, or the cook, made cake once or twice, or possibly blanc-mange, which was very much praised; but of the practical details required in the getting up of the most ordinary breakfast, dinner, or supper, she knows nothing, and has not the remotest intention or inclination to become acquainted with them.</p>
<p>The final result is, that they go to "board" in some highly genteel establishment, where the prices are high in proportion to the gentility and lack of real comfort, and some fine morning the young gentleman wakes up to the knowledge that he is tied to a wife who doubles his expenses, but has added nothing to his happiness, or at any rate, nothing to the real value and usefulness of his life.</p>
<p>This is a matrimonial swindle. Girls ought not to marry until they are ready and willing to accept the position of head of a household, and capable of making a home what it should be to husband and children.</p>
<p>If a man can find a woman to act as his mistress for her board and clothes, well and good--there is no law to prevent it; but for a woman bearing the honored name of wife to hold so dependent and humilating a position, is fearful degradation.</p>
<p>The marriage relation is one of reciprocal interests, duties, and responsibilities; and no young lady ought to marry until she is 
 
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=18"/>
willing to assume her share of them. True affection on the part of the husband will lighten, and make duties pleasures, but whatever aspect they bear, she must not shrink from them. If she has not received the training necessary to fit her for the position, it is her misfortune; but it will be her fault, if she does not try as far as possible to remedy the evil.</p>
<p>Want of means constitutes no sort of reason why young married people should not go to housekeeping. What we spend on foolish and useless gewgaws and presents would, in nine cases out of ten, if usefully applied, set them up in a style quite in accordance with their means, if not their inclination.</p>
<p>But it is not for themselves they fear. They are willing, or at least they think so, to live together in an attic; but society! Well, what has society got to do with it? Society will not pay your butcher's and grocer's bills, nor care a copper whether they are paid or not. Society will eat ice-cream, oysters, and cake of your providing, but that is not what you are marrying for.</p>
<p>You have chosen a comparatively poor man, your business is to adapt yourself to his circumstances, to make the most of his means in providing a pleasant home, and bringing up carefully and conscientiously the children which may be given you. If society find you out, or if you find it worth while to fill up any of the chinks or interstices with occasional glimpses of the false, glittering, outside world--good! you will come back to your sweet home with so much the more relish; but do not <emph rend="italic">marry</emph> it, do not sacrifice your own sense of duty, and the happiness and welfare of husband and family to it.</p>
<p>Talk of happiness,--there is none like that of an intelligent, affectionate family circle. There is no pleasure, no enjoyment equal to that of a mother ministering to the wants, or gratifying the natural and innocent tastes of her children. The pleasure is all the greater, because it is a <emph rend="italic">surprise.</emph></p>
<p>Young women very often dread the exacting care of a family, and expect to find wifely and maternal duties irksome and wearisome; that is the reason why they would so willingly escape them, as they fancy, by boarding, and not having children.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, or fortunately, God has managed it so that we cannot take the pleasures of life without bearing its pains; we 
 
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=19"/>
cannot shirk a plain line of duty, without incurring the penalty. But we can, and do, by taking upon ourselves bravely, its burdens, find an exaltation of womanhood, and a hight and depth of happiness, such as we never before dreamed of.</p>
<p>Exceptions are said to exist to every general rule; but there are very few to this, that when people marry, they ought to set right about making a home of their own. If you can only afford two rooms, live in two rooms. If your means will compass a small house, but not a large one, then take the small one, and be happy and thankful.</p>
<p>I would not give a wisp of straw for a young woman who does not want, on her marriage, to occupy her own little domain; who does not revel in anticipation over the contents of kitchen and closet, if there is only a small cook stove in one, and a set of delf in the other. But this suggests a matter of some importance.</p>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">KITCHEN FURNISHING.</hd>
<p>In selecting a house to live in, particularly if it is a small one, give the preference to a pleasant, sunny kitchen, which will at least look clean when it is clean, and into which it will not be disagreeable to enter.</p>
<p>As a general rule, buy as little as possible on first going to housekeeping; it is easy to add more when experience has discovered to you precisely what you want; but if you should indulge in any extravagance, let it be in the kitchen furnishing.</p>
<p>It is a real pleasure to get a glimpse of an orderly kitchen and neat closets, newly fitted up with all the useful modern contrivances for saving labor, and making it agreeable, and as the whole cost would not amount to more than one expensive carpet, it is not worth while to do without them.</p>
<p>It is economical, moreover, to have all kitchen utensils of the best quality; cheap pans, brushes, pails, earthenware and the like, are not only an "eyesore" in a house, and bad or disagreeable to use, but they are good for nothing; they eternally want replacing, 
 
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=20"/>
while a really good article is not only taken better care of, but will stand infinitely more of hard usage.</p>
<p><implement>Oil cloth</implement> is the best material for covering a kitchen floor; it is easily kept clean, and does not absorb the dirt and grease.</p>
<p>Short, white muslin curtains to kitchen windows are considered "nonsense" by some people, but they are tidy, and the cost and washing are not much.</p>
<p>Of course the kitchen will be supplied with <implement>dresser,</implement> table with drawer, and ironing table. As to chairs, three and a common rocker are sufficient; but I would enliven the walls with a picture or two, if possible, and encourage the cook, or maid of all work, to have her monthly rose or pot of geranium in the window.</p>
<p>Under the shelves of the kitchen closets, it is a good plan to have narrow strips of board, in which nails or tacks can be inserted, for the purpose of hanging up all sorts of small articles, such as iron and wooden spoons, sugar and <implement>flour sifters,</implement> <implement>tin strainers,</implement> <implement>lemon squeezer,</implement> <implement>lemon grater,</implement> <implement>egg beater,</implement> <implement>skewers,</implement> <implement>small sauce pans,</implement> <implement>cake turner,</implement> <implement>rolling pin,</implement> and such things as one is most likely to want, and which it is convenient to have in sight.</p>
<p>The floors of all closets should be covered with <implement>oil-cloth,</implement> so that they can be easily washed up, and kept neat and clean.</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT.</hd>
<p>Women are sometimes accused of managing too much, and sometimes of not managing at all; but the most perfect system of management is, undoubtedly, that which outwardly betrays itself least, and in the results of which, there is not suspected to have been any management at all.</p>
<p>Regularity is the pivot upon which all household management turns; where there is a lack of system there is a lack of comfort, that no amount of individual effort can supply. Forethought also is necessary, so that the work may be all arranged beforehand; done in its proper order, and at the right time. Never, except in cases of extreme emergency, allow Monday's washing to be put 
 
<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=21"/>
off till Tuesday; Tuesday's ironing till Wednesday, or Wednesday's finishing up and "setting to rights," till Thursday. Leave Thursday for extra work; or when that is not required, for resting day, or half holiday, and as a preparation for the up stairs' sweeping and dusting of Friday, and the downstairs' baking and scrubbing of Saturday.</p>
<p>Arrange work so as to save fuel as much as possible. Mix bread at night, so that it will be ready to bake with that "first fire" which always makes the oven hot in the morning. Prepare fruit over night, so that pies or other things can be quickly made and baked immediately after. Prepare hashes for breakfast, over night. Have the kitchen and dining room put in order before retiring to rest. Have kindlings and whatever is needed for building fires laid ready, and the fire in the kitchen raked down, so that it can be built up in the shortest possible space of time. This is not only a saving in the morning, but will be found useful in case of illness in the night, when a fire is often required at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>Try to buy in as large quantities as possible, so as to save the perpetual running out to the grocery. Supplies on hand also enable the housekeeper to provide a more varied table, with far greater economy than is possible where every thing is bought by the half a pound, more or less.</p>
<p>Every family that can possibly find means to do it, or a place to properly keep the articles, should commence winter with fuel, potatoes, apples, flour, and butter, enough to last till Spring. A good supply of hominy, rice, farina, Indian meal, preserved fish, and other staples, including sugar, should also be laid in, not forgetting a box of raisins, one of currants, a third of soap, and a fourth of starch.</p>
<p>There is such an immense saving in soap well dried, that it is surprising so many housekeepers content themselves with buying it in damp bars. Starch also is frightfully wasted by quarter, and half pound purchases, which are frequently all absorbed at one time, by careless girls, in doing the washing for a small family.</p>
<p>But in most American families, the largest amount of waste, probably, takes place in the use of fuel. Heretofore, fuel of all kinds has been comparatively cheap, and very little supervision has 
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=22"/>
been exercised over its use. At present rates however, it is an item of considerable importance; and it is quite time that servants were taught how to employ it to the best advantage.</p>
<p>In nine out of ten kitchens, when there is any cooking to be done the range is made red hot; when the cooking is done, the fire is left to go down to ashes, and is then raised by means of a wasteful pile of kindling wood. When no cooking is going on, and a large fire is not needed, the dampers will frequently be left open, and the fuel allowed to blaze itself out up the chimney instead of being kept in reserve for actual service.</p>
<p>The general principle of construction upon which American kitchen stoves and ranges is based, renders them either very economical, or very much otherwise, according to the way they are managed. After the fire is first built in an ordinary stove, or range, the dampers ought all to be closed up and not opened again during the day, except while broiling, or something of that sort. If the grate is kept clear, and the fire replenished with a small quantity of coal, before it begins to get low, both the oven, and the top of the range will be kept sufficiently hot for any kind of cooking, and it will be done all the better for being done somewhat more slowly, than is customary with the well meaning, but terribly blundering, and irresponsible race of wild Irish girls, who officiate as the high priestesses of our domestic altars.</p>
<p>The strictest attention on the part of a house-keeper, is necessary, to see that certain articles are kept for their proper use; for instance, that the dish cloth is not used for a floor cloth, that the napkins are not used to wipe up the dishes, the dish towels as dusters, a new broom to sweep out the back yard, and the best new enamelled sauce pan, for melting down grease.</p>
<p>Where the lady of the house attends partly to her own work, she will naturally see to all these things; but where it is left wholly to servants, there are always complaints of missing articles, and an inspection of the kitchen, or ironing table drawer, would generally bring them all to light, although in a state almost unrecognizable, from dirt, and their contiguity to whitening, hair oil, candle grease, combs and brushes, and other articles, all of which it is found "handy" to keep in a drawer in the kitchen, with mats, table cloths, towels, and other things destined for family use.</p>
 
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=23"/>
<p>It is hardly necessary after this to say that a kitchen being once provided with necessary and convenient articles for cleaning and cooking, the presiding genius should be held to a strict accountability for them. <implement>Pudding cloths</implement> should be forthcoming whenever wanted,--dry, clean, and free from stains; towels, napkins, pans, bowls, and cooking utensils, should be kept strictly to their uses, and not put away till perfectly clean and dry.</p>
<p><implement>Ironing sheets,</implement> <implement>blankets,</implement> <implement>skirt board,</implement> <implement>bosom board,</implement> <implement>iron holder,</implement> <implement>rubber,</implement> and the like, should be kept smoothly folded in the drawer of the ironing table, when not in use.</p>
<p>The shelves of kitchen, dining-room, and other closets, should be covered with fresh paper, neatly cut out on the edges, once in two weeks, and dusted down twice a week.</p>
<p>Pot closets, safes, and refrigerators, should be thoroughly scrubbed out every week, and the latter aired every day.</p>
<p>Good brooms and brushes will last a long time if care is taken of them. When first bought they should be allowed to stand in cold water for twelve hours, and then thoroughly dried before using. When not in use, they should be hung up by a loop of twine, or cord, so that the weight may not rest on the edge of the splinters, and break them. Four large brooms should be provided, one for the kitchen, one for the parlor, one for the sleeping rooms, and one for the family, or "living" room. A "<implement>whisk</implement>" will be required for every room in the house, besides one for the hall.</p>
<p>As soon as the kitchen broom is worn down so as to render it unfit to sweep the floor with ease and comfort, take it for the cellar, door steps, and back yard; take the one from the sitting room for the kitchen, the one from the parlor to the sitting room, and get a new one for the parlor.</p>
<p>Exact punctuality in serving the meals, and punctual attendance at them; it is oftener the fault of the family, than the servants, that meals are served at irregular hours. Where the members make a practice of sitting down any time, and food is kept waiting until it suits their pleasure or convenience to partake of it, irrespective of household necessities, servants, or any one else, will naturally become careless and neglectful.</p>
<subsection class1="household">
<hd align="center">HOUSEHOLD MEMORANDA.</hd>
<p>Dried herbs should be tied each separately in a paper bag, and 
 
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=24"/>
hung against the wall in the store-room. Mint, pennyroyal, catnip, sage, thyme, summer-savory and parsley, are all good to have in the house.</p>
<p>Parsley should be bunched before it goes to seed, and hung up to dry. In a week, or two, it may be put in paper bags, and is ready for use, for soup, stuffing, or fricassee.</p>

<subsection class1="household">
<hd align="center">PIECE BAGS.</hd>
<p>Out of an old calico dress make three piece bags, and label each one of them with its written name upon a small square piece of white muslin, which must be sewn upon the side of the bag. One should be the "rag-bag," another the "white piece-bag," a third, the "colored piece-bag,"--they will be found very useful.</p>

<p>Mending stockings for a large family, is a somewhat onerous, and not altogether agreeable duty. As soon as the daughters are old enough they should be set to mending their own; but even then, there is sometimes a large pile for "mother's" work basket. Do not hurry them; however, mend them conscientiously, if it is only one pair at a time. Have needle and darning cotton of the proper size, take a large area in every direction beyond the hole, leave loops at each end of the thread, as it is drawn out, for shrinkage--and darn carefully and extensively over all the thin places. Hose mended in this way will not require the process more than twice, during their existence, provided the quality in the first place was the best. Cheap hose are not worth buying at all.</p>

<hd align="center">HINTS ON ECONOMY.</hd>
<p>PROVIDE ON SATURDAY for Monday, so as not to take up the fire with cooking, or time in running errands, any more than is possible on washing day.</p>
<p>WAIT TILL ARTICLES, fruit, fish, poultry and vegetables, are in full season, before purchasing. They are then not only much lower in price than when first brought to market, but finer in quality and flavor.</p>
<p>OUTSIDE GARMENTS, bonnets, cloaks, hats, shawls, scarfs and the like, will last clean and fresh much longer, if the dust is carefully removed from them by brushing and shaking after returning from a ride or a walk.</p>
<p>WHEN YOUR APPLES begin to rot, pick the specked ones out carefully; stew them up with cider and sugar, and fill all your empty self-sealing cans. In this way you may keep in nice apple sauce till apples come again.</p>
<p>PICKLE OR <implement>PRESERVE JARS</implement> should be washed in lukewarm or cold water, and dried in the sun or near the fire. Hot water cracks the polished surface of the inside, and renders them unfit for their specific use.</p>
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=29"/>
<p>NEVER ALLOW CHILDREN to eat butter with meat or gravy; it is both wasteful and injurious.</p>
<p>HOT BUCKWHEAT CAKES will go farther and last longer than any other single article of food. A celebrated judge declared that he could remain in court all day, without feeling a symptom of hunger, after a breakfast of buckwheat cakes.</p>
<p>A STEW is not a bad dish for a family dinner, once a week; make it of good meat, and savory with sweet herbs, and the most fastidious will not object to it.</p>
<p>RISE EARLY on fine summer mornings, and throw all the windows of the house open, so that it may exchange its close atmosphere, for the cool, fresh air. Have the work done before the heat of the day comes on, and save it as much as possible during the warmest weather.</p>
<p>TAKE CARE OF THE FOOD that is brought into the house, and see that none of it is wasted; but do not be always on the lookout for <emph rend="italic">cheap</emph> things. Beans are cheap, and very good sometimes; corn meal is cheap too, and even more available, because it can be made into a great variety of dishes, but people would not care to live on beans and corn meal all the time, because they are cheap. Eating is intended as a means of enjoyment, as well as of sustaining life; and it is right to avail ourselves of the abundant resources provided, as far as we can consistently.</p>
<p>USE TEA LEAVES, or short, freshly cut grass, to sprinkle upon carpets before sweeping. It will freshen up the colors, and save the usual cloud of dust.</p>
<p>HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAN, on Saturday night, something nice for tea, and also for Sunday morning breakfast. Let the approach of the Sabbath be anticipated in all things, with pleasure. Stay at home with the children on Sabbath evening, and finish the day with a sacred concert.</p>
 
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=30"/>
<p>ALLOW NO HOLES, or corners in the house, in drawers, on shelves, or in closets, for the stowing away of dirty rags, old bottles, grease-pots, and broken crockery. When bottles are emptied, let them be cleaned, and put down in the cellar, until they are wanted. Harbor no dirty grease pots, and when an article is broken past recovery, throw it away at once; there is no use in keeping it to collect dust, and cobwebs.</p>
<p>MAKE A POINT of examining safe, refrigerator, closets, drawers, and all receptacles for food, and kitchen articles, at least as often as once a week, either Saturday, or washing day. Look into <implement>pickle jars,</implement> <implement>bread jars,</implement> <implement>cake jars,</implement> <implement>butter tubs,</implement> apple, and potato barrels, everything in fact, examine their condition, see if they are kept covered and clean, and that food put away, is not left to spoil, or be wasted.</p>
<p>THE FEWER SERVANTS THE BETTER--two requires a third to wait upon them, and so on <emph rend="italic">ad infinitum</emph>. Have good servants however, pay good wages, and make them responsible for their work.</p>
<p>IF IT IS POSSIBLE, and when there is a will there is a way, call your household together, after breakfast every morning, and have domestic worship, be it ever so short. A verse of a hymn, a passage from the Bible, and just a few words of heartfelt prayer, and praise, sets everything right for the day, smooths ruffled tempers, and puts the domestic machine in nicely running order. It is also no bad preparation for the temptations and annoyances of business.</p>
<p>BEFORE SWEEPING a room, have the furniture, and especially all the small articles, dusted and removed. This keeps them looking fresh, and new.</p>
<p>WEAR PRETTY MORNING DRESSES; they are inexpensive, and easily preserved from injury, by a large calico apron enveloping the skirt of the dress, and sleeves of the same kind, gathered into a band, top, and bottom, and extending over the elbows. These can be slipped on and off in a minute, and with a bib added to the

apron in front, affords complete protection, while engaged in dusting, making pastry, and the like.</p>
<p>ALWAYS HAVE YOUR TABLE served neatly, and then if friends "happen in," you will not be ashamed to ask them to share your meal. Be hospitable, if it is only a crust, and a cup of cold water; if it is clean and good of its kind, there is no reason to blush for it; the hearty welcome will make amends for the absence of rich viands.</p>

<hd align="center">THE USE OF FUEL.</hd>
<p>There is no department of housekeeping in which our national spirit of waste and extravagance is more clearly exemplified, than 
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=32"/>
in our use of fuel. Even the enormous advance in prices has led to no retrenchment or reform in this respect. Coal and wood are just as recklessly as ever, shovelled into the cellar. Bridget makes the same blazing fires, subject to no supervision, except a faint, general direction, to "sift the cinders every morning;" and Bridget says "yes'm" as usual, but there being nobody to see, or know whether she does or not, in nineteen cases out of twenty, she does not do it.</p>
<p>Every little while through the day, the fires are raked down, and fresh coal put on, the dampers of stove or range left wide open, and for so much cooking as a cup of tea, or a dish of potatoes, a fresh fire built with range made red hot, and as much fuel wasted as would have cooked a thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<formula class="household" ethnicgroup="England">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">GRATE FIRES.</purpose>
These are generally considered as requiring a great deal of coal, and so they do, under the usual system of management in this country. But let us see how they manage grate fires in England.</p>
<p>The grate is cleared, with the exception of a few scattering cinders, which forms a sort of body, for the paper, which is torn up in small pieces, and crushed down, and the wood, which is neatly and compactly laid "across and across." When the largest and best cinders remaining are picked out and thrown on, a match is applied, cinders are still put on wherever they are needed to catch the blaze, and when the wood is burnt down, and the cinders are all a-glow, <ingredient>fresh coal</ingredient> is used to fill up the grate. The <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> are then sifted, the cinders, which are fine and small, damped, and when the fire has burned red through, <emph rend="italic">without the use of the <implement>blower</implement></emph>, the wet cinders are thrown on the top. In this way a grate fire will last through a whole day with once replenishing, and keep a room warmer than we do, without blaze, our frequent use of the <implement>blower,</implement> and reckless waste of fuel.</p>
</formula>
<subsection class1="household">
<hd align="center">KITCHEN RANGES.</hd>
<p>Nearly all of these are built on the air tight principle, and should be kept closed up tight all the time. The fire will be found to burn equally well, though more moderately; the oven will be always hot, and cooking can be done slowly, as it ought, on the 
 
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=33"/>
top of the range, with much less trouble, and infinitely better than if "rushed through," at a red heat.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="household">
<hd align="center">PARLOR HEATERS.</hd>
<p>These new <implement>heaters</implement> are very good for small houses; we used one for years, with great satisfaction, and found it quite as efficient, and much safer, more convenient and more economical than a furnace.</p>
<p>Parlor <implement>heaters</implement> are fitted into the wall, and take up no more room than a grate; they should be attended to with regularity, and then the fire will hardly ever need to go out; once in two months is quite as often as it requires to be made up fresh. At night, wetted cinders should be thrown on the fire so as to thickly cover it while it is good, and the dampers shut up close; these will keep the fire almost intact till the next morning, when a thorough raking down will be needed. A parlor <implement>heater</implement> properly managed, burns out about as much coal as one large grate or two small stoves; but excepting in the very coldest weather, it will comfortably heat the whole house.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="household">
<hd align="center">SPRING FUEL.</hd>
<p>Coke is excellent fuel for spring and fall, if it is carefully and rightly used; but if it is mixed with hard coal and thrown on a kitchen fire by a reckless servant, at discretion, it becomes equally extravagant and useless. Coke makes a bright, hot fire, kindles easily, and goes out easily; but it can also be made to last a long while, by packing it a little on top, and neglecting to rake it down. This is the method for early spring, when fires are required in the morning and evening, but not much through the sunshiny part of the day.</p>
<p>A great saving is effected in spring fuel, by putting the "slack" from coal, in a heap by itself, and with it, ashes from which the cinders have not been taken. Dampen the heap occasionally with a little water, and add to it, whenever there is material. Doing this through the coldest weather will form a sort of compost, hard and insoluble, which can be broken apart, and furnishes splendid fuel for spring grate fires, or for parlor <implement>heaters.</implement></p>

<section class1="soups">
<hd align="center">STOCKS.</hd>
<p>Stock is the foundation of soups, and also of good gravies, sauces, and the like. A French cook can do nothing without the <implement>stock pot,</implement> and keeps it supplied in a way that is both useful, and economical.</p>
<p>Stock can be made to keep for a considerable time, and be used for many purposes, if occasional additions are made, and the whole of the liquor re-scalded. It may be made from meat, or from bones, or from both, or it may be made from bones with the addition of refuse meat, the trimmings of regular joints. Chicken and turkey bones may be thrown in, and will help to enrich, and give flavor to the preparation. Any kind of bones with a little meat upon them, will make good stock, if they are <emph rend="italic">simmered</emph>, not boiled, long enough, and beef, mutton, veal, poultry, and other bones may be stewed together. In stewing them down, use the liquor if you have it, in which other meat has been boiled, so that nothing may be wasted. Shank bones, trimmings from chops, any thing of this sort may be thrown in, simmered all day, then poured into a jar, and the fat removed the next morning. It is then frequently a jelly, and ready to convert into soup, with the aid of herbs, and vegetables--or kept for other uses. Stock sours very soon after the vegetables have been boiled in it, so it is best not to put the vegetables in till needed for soup.</p>
<p>If your stock is made of meat, or partly of meat, cut it up fine, and always put it on in cold water, if the water is hard, put a pinch of soda in it. This will extract all the pieces of the bones and meat. If on the contrary, you want to boil meat, and retain its pieces, put it on in boiling water. [See the Principles of Cooking.]</p>

To pickle cucumbers for market cut them from the vines without bruising the stems, take them carefully to the cellar, pack in barrels putting different sizes in separate barrels; spread a layer of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> between each layer of <ingredient>cucumbers,</ingredient> sufficient to entirely cover the <ingredient>pickles.</ingredient> Pack the <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> daily as they are picked, discarding the crooked or those of slow growth. The brine will be formed without the addition of water, by the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> extracted by the <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Keep boards over the pickles, with weights to press them under the brine. <ingredient>Pickles</ingredient> packed in this way can be preserved for years with <ingredient>pure salt;</ingredient> but if the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is mixed with <ingredient>lime</ingredient> they will soften and spoil. In two months after the barrel is filled, take them from the brine, freshen and green. To green them, prepare <ingredient>alum water,</ingredient> put the <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> in a vat or <implement>boiler</implement> lined with tinned copper; heat the <ingredient>alum water,</ingredient> and pour it over them. Pickle makers usually employ this process except that they throw steam into the vats to heat the <ingredient>alum water,</ingredient> and if managed properly the pickles may be greened with less action of copper than when scalded in the usual method in bright brass kettles. Take the <ingredient>pickles</ingredient> from the vat when a little green, and pour over them <ingredient>water</ingredient> boiling hot. If not greened sufficiently, repeat the <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> until they are the desired color, and when cold put them in good <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient> Let them remain until quite soured; then change to pretty <ingredient>strong vinegar,</ingredient> which will keep the pickles hard and sour.

<hd align="center">PUDDINGS AND PIES.</hd>
<p>A great deal has been said lately against puddings and pies, and desserts generally. People have been warned against them as unwholesome; long catalogues of diseases,--in fact, all the ills that flesh is heir to, have been laid to their charge; and all, we verily believe, without any more reason than could be given for stopping the use of fuel, because some people are careless enough to set fire to their dresses, or their houses.</p>
<p>The dessert is to many people the most important part of the dinner; it is always so to children, and there is no reason why it should not be just as healthy, just as digestible as the dinner. In fact, there are many persons, who neither eat puddings nor pies themselves, nor allow their children to eat them, who will yet compel them to swallow tough, ill-cooked meat, soggy potatoes, and bread, heavy, sour, and indigestible, as so much lead.</p>
<p>Eating is not merely a duty, it is one of the pleasures of life; and pains should be taken by every housekeeper to make it a source of as much enjoyment as possible. The dessert is the holiday part of the dinner; it is a subject of expectation and anticipation--it affords an opportunity of making up for a rather slim first course, and often drives away the unpleasant remembrance of a cold leg of mutton, or impenetrable beef-steak.</p>
<p>Of course, it requires a little time and judgment--every detail of housekeeping does, and should be adapted to the dinner which has preceded it.</p>
<p>When the meal is hot,--and hearty, a light, simple dessert is sufficient, but when it consists of cold meat, or some make-shift warmed up from the previous day, nice fruit puddings, and home-made pies, deep and good, are very welcome.</p>
 
<pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=156"/>
<p>We always suspect a man who does not like pie or pudding, just as we would a woman that did not love children; he is sure to be cross, and hard to manage, difficult to please, and never feels good natured, not even after his dinner.</p>
<p>Solid flour puddings are always doubtful. They are too heavy for this climate, unless made a very important part of the dinner. Desserts require to be fruity,--fruity in substance, fruity in flavor. We do not condemn all pastry, but in puddings and pies, the more fruit and less paste, the better.</p>
<p>Fruit alone makes a very good dessert; and when in the season, and plentiful, a very cheap one. Apples, grapes, melons, pears, and peaches, are all fine for dessert, and can be used singly, or combined, according to means, and occasion.</p>
<p>Nuts, with apples, are excellent in winter; but nuts should never be put on the table alone,--they are not only indigestible, but without juicy fruit as an accompaniment, unpalatable. A dish of apples, or oranges, will be found a very welcome addition to a dessert composed of any kind of pie or pudding in which fresh fruit is not an ingredient, such as plain rice, corn starch, custard, and the like.</p>
<p>Bread and butter, apple-sauce, and a cup of tea, winds up a family dinner very nicely, on washing or any other day, when it is not convenient to have anything else.</p>
<p>But whatever your dessert is composed of, be careful to have it put upon the table with due ceremony. Children are great observers of small matters of etiquette, and quickly notice the difference between company, and family manners. Do not, because "there is no one present," allow it to be huddled upon the table, amidst a confusion of meat and vegetables, without changing the plates, or the knives and forks, and brushing off the table cloth. Go through "all the motions." A little ceremony in families is a good thing; it preserves the respect of the members for themselves and each other; it prevents the familiarity which breeds contempt, and teaches children how to behave away from home. If circumstances require a degree of hurry which compels you to waive ceremony, apologise as you would to friends, were they present, and request the other members of the family to proceed as usual.</p>
<p>But be sure, young housekeepers and young mothers, not to 
 
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=157"/>
relinquish your pies and puddings, it is one way of appealing to, and winning the hearts of husbands, and children. Moreover, acquire the practice, and as a general rule make them yourself There are very few servants that can be trusted with the use of the materials required, or who can make the same article twice alike It is also a privilege which a good wife and mother will not like to forego, to compound the particular dish of which husband and children are so fond, and which they will always remember in connection with her kind heart, and skillful hand, as long as they live. Who that has lived to man's or woman's estate, but remembers something which "mother" used to make, the like of which no one could make or ever will again, and in nineteen cases out of twenty it is some especial pie or pudding.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to urge upon any one the <emph rend="italic">eating</emph> of this delicious fruit;everybody, man, woman, and child, anticipates the season with pleasure. But we should like to urge upon all who possess a few feet of ground the wisdom of cultivating a "strawberry patch." So great a gift, so profusely bestowed in return for a little labor, ought to be shared by the poorest. We hope the time will come when fruit will be so plentiful and so cheap that it can be picked by the weary, thirsty traveller on the roadside. Why should not apple-trees, cherry-trees, plum-trees, peach-trees, and pear-trees be planted along the unsightly fences, hiding them,

and supplying God's good gifts, without money or price, to those who need them? The man who shall first endow his farm in this way will, at small cost, become a public benefactor, and establish a claim to immortality. But to return to strawberries: this is so perfect a fruit, so exquisite in flavor, so excellent in quality, that cooking, or manipulation of any kind, rather impairs than improves it. A little white sugar and cream is the only addition that can be made, and even this is a concession to our unnaturally sweetened and perverted palates, rather than to the necessities of the case. As for strawberry pie, strawberry dumpling, strawberry pudding, and the whole range of dishes in which strawberries are <emph rend="italic">cooked,</emph> they should be stricken out of every housekeeper's list, with a single reservation in favor of "strawberry cake," in which, however, the strawberries are <emph rend="italic">not</emph> cooked, and which is so great a pet with the male as well as female part of every household, that we dare not say a word against it, even if it was not one of our own special weaknesses.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets" ethnicgroup="French">
<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">APPLE JELLY.</purpose>
Take one dozen of the largest <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> pare and slice them into three quarts and one pint of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Put them into a tin pan, and boil them until they become a <ingredient>pulp</ingredient> and one half of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is consumed. Pour it into a <implement>jelly-bag,</implement> and after it has done running, press what <ingredient>juice</ingredient> you can from the bag. To every pint of <ingredient>juice</ingredient> add one pound of <ingredient>white sugar;</ingredient> set the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> on the fire and let them boil twenty minutes skimming it all the time. Add <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> and peel to taste. Pour it into <implement>tea-cups</implement> or <implement>jelly-glasses</implement> at hand, and turn it out entire. The above quantity of <ingredient>apples</ingredient> will make about three pints of <ingredient>juice.</ingredient> Remember, after you have pared one <ingredient>apple,</ingredient> slice it immediately into the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and do not pare them all together; moreover, let them lie, or it will render them red, and you will lose a great quantity of the apple juice. <ingredient>Golden pippin apples</ingredient> make the finest <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient> It is necessary to be very careful about over-boiling all fruit jellies, else they soon spoil; fifteen to twenty minutes after the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has been added is generally sufficient. It is also important to put jellies and jams into the moulds or jars, the moment they are taken from the fire.</p>
<p><variation>Another method from the French is as follows:--Choose fine-flavored, jucy, ripe <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> peel them, and cut them into quarters, putting them into <ingredient>water</ingredient> as they are cut, to prevent their turning black. When they are all cut, place them in the <implement>preserving-pan</implement> and put to them just <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover them. Let them cook until they are quite soft; take them out of the <implement>preserving-pan,</implement> place them in a sieve, and let the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> drain from them. Boil the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> with an equal weight of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> until it will <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> (when tested by placing a little on a cold plate,) and pour it into the jelly

It should not be underbaked, and it is just as important that it should not be over-done. It is a common error that over-done bread is healthy. If the crusts are thick and hard they can be moistened up, covering the loaf fresh from the oven with one or two thicknesses of damp cloth. Several thicknesses of wet cloth wrapped around it in this way render it indigestible. In making the batter over night, five or six middling sized <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> boiled to a mush, and pulped through a <implement>colander,</implement> may be added to it.</p>

<section class1="generalfood">
<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">BREAKFAST.</purpose>
A great variety of dishes are unnecessary for breakfast, but see that what you do have, is nicely cooked, and properly served. Unless sickness or some other circumstance prevents, the mistress of the house should always add the finishing touches to the breakfast room, and the breakfast table. The most experienced servant will fail in producing just the right degree of light and sunlight, in getting rid of the last speck of dust, or the latest evidence of ashes, and never thinks at all of transferring a branch of rosebuds, and geranium from the garden to the mantel piece; these belong to the gentler thought, and more refined instincts of the cultivated lady, and such duties are not at all beneath the dignity of the highest in the land.</p>
<p>That the dishes may be well-cooked, and well served, they must be adapted to the other services required on that day. On washing and ironing days, for instance, as little time, and as little of the fire should be used as possible, and care should be taken to save interruption to the important, and principal business of the day.</p>
<p>Broiled chicken, or warmed over chicken, and omeletts, are always nice breakfast dishes, but in cities the prices puts them out of the reach of ordinary people, except on extraordinary occasions. The regular dishes, such as beefsteak, mutton chops, fish, broiled ham, eggs, and warmed over potatoes, are all understood, and in the different kinds and degrees, constitute the daily breakfast probably, of half the world.</p>
<p>There is a very important point however, to which little attention is paid, and that is fruit. "Fruit," saith the old proverb, "is golden in the morning, silver at noon, and lead at night," yet it is only at night, that in this country, we eat it at all, as part of a meal. This is wrong, fruit is a most valuable part of food, it cannot be too 
 
<pb n="249" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=263"/>
highly estimated; more fruit, with less saleratus, and rich greasy compounds, such as butter with meats, gravies, and the like, would take away the occupation of half the doctors, and reduce wonderfully the sum total of dyspepsia and liver complaints.</p>
<p>A distinguished physician has said that one or two tart Messina oranges eaten before breakfast during the three spring months, would cure the worst obstinate bilious disorder; but the cure would undoubtedly be as effectual if they were eaten at breakfast, and the usual amount of pork and melted butter on hot cakes, reduced during that time.</p>
<p>The rule should be to have fresh fruit on the table every morning, as long as it lasts, and then a preparation of dried, canned, or preserved fruits, a small investment in Guava jelly; and that India fruit, for breakfast, will not be thrown away, after your own stock is exhausted, and you begin to tire of apples, and the common dried varieties.</p>
<p>A very valuable adjunct to the breakfast table is the tomato; highly prized as it is, its admirable medicinal qualities are only just beginning to be discovered. Providentially, it is so cheap, and grows so readily and profusely, that the poorest person can luxuriate in its excellence, as well as the richest, and derive all the more benefit from not being able to destroy its virtue with butter, and an excess of condiments.</p>
<p>Tomatoes are an almost soveriegn cure for dyspepsia, and should be on the table, raw or cooked, the year round. Persons habituated to them, soon learn to love them in any form, sliced with a little pepper, salt, and vinegar, stewed, baked, or even fresh from the vines; the least healthful and generally the least palatable mode of serving them, is sweetened, or cooked with sugar.</p>
<p>Mush, hominy, wheaten grits, or some dish of that sort, should be frequently seen upon the breakfast table, such food is excellent for children, and soon becomes very palatable, and highly esteemed by grown persons. Moreover if it is not eaten when first boiled, it is not wasted; it is just as good fried, or used as a basis for griddle cakes.</p>
<p>In some families, warm soda biscuit for breakfast, is the regular thing; this is very hurtful. Good home-made bread, not quite fresh, is best. French bread, baked the day before, next best; 
 
<pb n="250" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=264"/>
good baker's twist, third best. For a change, warm corn bread, or johnny cake may be made for breakfast, rice cakes, or waffles, and if biscuits, make them from the light dough mixed over night, shortened with a little butter.</p>
<p>When the spring water-cresses come in, there should be thankfulness. Pile them up fresh, green, and crisp, upon a dish in the centre of the table, and eat them with new laid eggs boiled soft, salt, nice Graham bread, and sweet butter. This is a breakfast suited to Lent, and fit for a Republican queen.</p>

It is better to buy whole coffee and grind it yourself. Let the <implement>coffee pot</implement> be clean and free from the smell of stale coffee. Grind sufficient <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> fresh for use at one time, then stir it about with the <ingredient>white</ingredient> and shell of an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> mixing them thoroughly. Or an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> may be mixed with half a pound of <ingredient>ground coffee,</ingredient> which is to be used as required, and the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> tends to preserve the aroma. Take a table-spoonful of <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> or less for each person, pour upon it as much <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> as will be required, and boil it up as quickly as possible. Pour out a tea-cupful and put it back again, or pour the whole backwards and forwards several times. Take it from the fire and pour half a tea-cupful of quite <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> into it and let it stand five minutes by the fire; but do not let it boil again, before you transfer it to the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> pot in which it is to be served. Do not shake it in doing this, as the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> shell and <ingredient>coffee powder</ingredient> will have settled at the bottom, and the liquid ought to be perfectly clear.

<hd rend="bold">TEA.</hd>
<p>"Tea," as a meal is a lost institution in most of our large cities. 
 
<pb n="255" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=269"/>
More's the pity, for it was the cosiest, and pleasantest meal of the day. Moreover, with it, has gone out early hours, and thrifty habits, attention to home duties, and love of home pleasures. The late breakfasts, which are the rule now, and the six o' clock dinners, not only destroy health, but give the day to gossiping and visiting, to shopping and the promenade, and afford an excuse for daily expensive lunches at fashionable restaurants, which make simple home fare distasteful.</p>
<p>"Tea," in the old-fashioned sense, is still to be met with occasionally in the country, and who that has ever assisted in a pleasant family circle at that most enjoyable of all meals, but remembers it with a longing to experience it once again. The cosy table, the light delicate food, the hot, fragrant beverage in small cups, handled tenderly, as if with a due appreciation of their contents; the leisure which all enjoy after the principal business of the day is over, and the stimulus to lively and agreeable conversation, which the meal affords.</p>
<p>But the <emph rend="italic">tea</emph> itself must be good; no luke warm infusion, no mere slop, by quantity of which you seek to make up for the quality. One cup of really good, inspiring tea, is worth a gallon of the liquid which well-intentioned housewives sometimes pour out, with the assurance that it is not strong, and will not hurt you. The truth is, that the amount of liquid is a positive injury, while, whatever of virtue the tea possessed, is drowned in it; but there are persons who still insist upon their ancient right to three or four cups, and perhaps the less tea there is in these, the better.</p>
</section>
<recipe class1="beverages">
<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">HOW TO MAKE TEA.</purpose>
Scald your tea-pot for six persons, put in three tea-spoonsful of best <ingredient>green tea,</ingredient> pour a little <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> upon it, and set it to steep. Put four tea-spoonsful of best <ingredient>black tea</ingredient> in a tin cup with a cover, pour <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> upon it, cover it tight, and bring it to a quick boil; let it boil a minute, and then add it to the green, which should only steep in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> not boil. Fill up with the necessary quantity of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and it is ready for the table.</p>
<p>It is not known by many persons, that the Oolong and other black <ingredient>teas</ingredient> require boiling, in order to extract their strength and virtue. Those who mourn over poor, weak, modern tea, are advised to try this method.</p>

<recipe class1="beverages" alcoholic="yes">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CURRANT CHAMPAGNE.</purpose>
Ingredients for thirty gallons:--Three bushels, or one hundred and fifty pounds of <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> seventy-five pounds of <ingredient>white Havanna</ingredient> or <ingredient>refined crushed sugar;</ingredient> three pints <ingredient>white brandy,</ingredient> with sufficient pure <ingredient>soft water.</ingredient> The <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be gathered in dry weather, when ripe; mash them to break every <ingredient>berry,</ingredient> but not bruise the stems; add a portion of the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and after stirring well, turn the mass on to a strainer, over a grain sieve, or riddle, rubbing and pressing very gently with the hands. The usual practice of squeezing and wringing through the strainer forces through too much <ingredient>pulp,</ingredient> occasioning too great a degree of fermentation. The <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> should be put into a tub or other open vessel, with the <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> and the liquor strained on to it. When the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is dissolved, strain the whole through a fine hair, or grass cloth, into a strong, sweet <implement>cask</implement> of thirty-two gallons, and fill up to within two gallons, which leaves sufficient room for the fermentation to proceed, and drive in the bung tight. It is desirable that all parts of the process should go on at the same time, and be finished with all possible dispatch. The sooner the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is bottled after it is perfectly fine, the more briskness it will exhibit. In producing champagne, it is necessary to give air for a short time, to increase the fermentation and deprive it of a great portion of its sweetness. The <ingredient>white currant</ingredient> is sweeter, and pleasanter flavored, when ripe, for table use, than the red. The wine made from it is nearly colorless, of sweet and pleasant flavor. Bottled before the fermentation has entirely subsided, it makes a fine champagne.</p>

Bruise ripe <ingredient>currants</ingredient> stripped from the stem, and add to every gallon of <ingredient>pulp,</ingredient> half a gallon of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> first boiled and cold; let it remain in a tub twenty-four hours to ferment; strain it through a <implement>hair sieve,</implement> not pressing it with the hand, but letting it take its time to run. Then stir well in two pounds and a half of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> to every gallon of liquor. Add a quart of best rectified <ingredient>spirit of wine</ingredient> to every six gallons. After it has stood six weeks, bottle it. If it is not very fine empty it into other bottles, let it stand two weeks and then rack it off into smaller bottles.</p>

After deducting the amount of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the remainder will be the pure <ingredient>juice;</ingredient> and now, to every gallon of the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> add two of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> including that first put in, and to every gallon of the mixture, add four pounds of <ingredient>crushed sugar.</ingredient> Put it into a <implement>cask,</implement> reserving sufficient to fill up while fermenting. Put the <implement>cask</implement> in a moderately cool dry room to ferment; as the refuse works at the bung; fill up with the liquor reserved. When it has ceased working, bung it close for nine months, and it will be fit for bottling and use. This will have much of the flavor of Port wine, and make an excellent article for sacramental purposes. By reducing the quantity of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and adding <ingredient>water,</ingredient> it will be a fair imitation of claret wine, for a summer drink.</p>

<p>The diet for invalids depends so much upon the condition of the patient, that only the most general directions can be given; the special application must be left in every case to the judgement of the nurse.</p>
<p>Neatness, cleanliness, and promptitude are the great requisites in a sick chamber. The best prepared food is spoiled by want of care and punctuality in placing it before the patient.</p>
<p>When persons are ill, their senses are often preternaturally acute; slight marks of neglect which would not be noticed at another time, become extremely offensive; and a few minutes delay, not only seems unpardonable, but is sometimes really injurious. Patience, tact, and natural kindness of disposition are essential qualities in a good nurse, and when to these are added firmness and good judgment, the sum total of excellence in this line has been reached. As a general rule however, one half the nurses injure their patients by absurd restrictions, and the other half by foolish indulgence.</p>

<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">FOOD FOR INFANTS.</purpose>
It is a sad, and significant fact, that at least half the children at the present time, are deprived of their proper sustenance, and left to the tender mercies of wet nurses, or the bottle. Between the two evils, it is difficult to say which is the least; but unless a superior nurse can be found--one intelligent, and thoroughly clean in her personal habits--we should say, choose the last, and bring it up by hand.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the best physicians, and the conviction is borne out by every mother's experience, that the moral, mental, and spiritual, as well as physical condition of a child is greatly influenced during its nursing period. Mothers who nurse their own children know that it is of the greatest importance to the quiet and healthful condition of the child, that they should be free from all sources of agitation, anxiety, and irritability. Overwork, giving way to fretfulness, or being subjected to the unreasonable temper and caprices of others, frequently induces a state of mind that shows itself plainly in the uneasiness and disquiet it produces in the infant, and would be seen with still greater distinctness were women accustomed to trace results more strictly to their causes.</p>
<p>If this is the case with the mother, if her mental and spiritual condition finds itself reflected so minutely in the lights and shadows of the little life which is dependent upon her, why should it not receive a coloring from the milk which it deprives from a dull, coarse, appetite-loving wet nurse of the ordinary stamp? Two thirds of these nurses make a necessity of strong tea and coffee, and malt liquor, two or three times a day; they are often anything but scrupulous in their personal habits, and so accustomed to the exercise 
 
<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=317"/>
of a violent will by virtue of their office, as to be unwilling to bear the slightest control or contradiction. These are not the influences which a thoughtful mother would like to have her child drink in with its milk.</p>
<p>We believe it to be a misfortune, the extent of which is not at all realized, when the mother cannot nurse her own child. The mother's milk contains all the elements necessary for its proper growth in every direction, and no substitute can be found for it; but where this is impossible, unless, as before remarked, a very superior nurse can be obtained, it is safer to trust to the simple food, which at least sustain life, and do not hurt if given at right times and in proper quantities, leaving the mental and spiritual activities unimpeded, though probably subject to a slower growth than if aided by the sympathetic magnetism of the mother's nature.</p>

<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">STARCHY FOOD.</purpose>
Such as arrowroot, sago, corn-starch, and the like, is commonly held to be very healthy and nutritious for infants, yet the experience of every physician, furnishes numerous instances of feeble, sickly children that are so fed, while the number is small that survive it. The reason of this is, that the digestive organs of infants are not sufficiently powerful to convert the starchy matter into nourishment; it therefore only serves to clog, and impede the action of the system, while the little victim is gradually being starved on the trifle of sustenance which it can obtain, from whatever sugar and milk is given with its other food.</p>

<hd size="larger" align="center">FOOD FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.</hd>
<p>The great danger in feeding young children lies not so much in the food, as in its preparation, or want of preparation. A hard indigestible potato is bad for them, and a little tender, stewed meat is good, but if the potato were mashed, and mealy, and the meat hard, and tough, the case would be just the reverse.</p>
<p>The principal danger is in their swallowing indigestible substances, and whether these are hard apples, or lumpy potatoes, tough meat, or sour bread, rich cake, or hickory nuts, makes very little difference, the irritation, and derangement produced is the same.</p>
<p>Meat for children under the age of ten years, should be cooked very tender, and cut up very small, or given in the form of soup. Potatoes should be mashed, apples roasted, or stewed, and if bread and milk could form their breakfast, and some kind of mush, with milk, their supper, they would be all the better for it, for the rest of their lives.</p>

<hd size="larger" align="center">LADIES' LUNCHES.</hd>
<p>These are not at all difficult, and the less fuss and preparation there is for them, the better; they may of course be made very elaborate, but in this case, it has become the fashion for ladies to engage a private room and lunch, for a certain number of guests, at a stylish restaurant, the hour, and extensive preparation, interfering with domestic economies, and regulations of the household, if allowed to take place at home.</p>
<p>Ordinarily however, "ladies' lunches," are simple affairs, delicate, <emph rend="italic">recherche,</emph> and more famous for the wit they evoke, and the enjoyment they create, than for the dishes, which are not unfrequently quite incongruous. "I will come," says one, "if you will have some of your delicious chicken salad;" "and I," says another, "if you can persuade your cook to make an omelette," "and I,--I want a cup of your chocolate," exclaims a third.</p>
<p>But whatever be the bill of fare, let it be such, that the presence of the hostess will not be required in the kitchen, nor a large attendance of servants in removing dishes.</p>
<p>Many of the pleasantest lunches are quite impromptu; one or more ladies call,--gentlemen nearly always lunch down town, in cities,--and the hostess without ceremony invites them to share her mid-day meal. In such a case no apology is necessary for very simple fare, the friendliness of the invitation being worth much more than variety, and costliness of dishes.</p>
<p>A dish of poached eggs and boiled ham, will answer for such an occasion, or delicate rice cakes, added to the cold ham, and chickens or sliced tomatoes with tender broiled lamb chops; all dishes easily and cheaply prepared, and sure to be appreciated. A box of sardines is useful to have on hand, but we do not consider them healthful eating, and recommend them only in case of emergency.</p>
<p>To a ladies' lunch, not more than six or eight guests should be 
 
<pb n="307" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=321"/>
invited, and the food should be all placed on the table at one time tea, coffee, or chocolate being served from a side table by a servant.</p>

<p>It does not come within the scope of this work to give directions for the getting up of elaborate and expensive entertainments.

<hd align="center">NEW YEAR'S TABLE</hd>
<p>The custom of receiving calls is becoming so very general out of New York city, that a few hints on the method of setting the table for the occasion may not come amiss.</p>
<p>What is called a substantial table, is out of fashion now, excepting among old-fashioned people, but it must still be remembered that as it is the taste of <emph rend="italic">gentlemen,</emph> and not of ladies that are to be cousulted on this day, sweets, cake and the like, should be subordinated to chicken salad, pickled oysters, potted salmon, sardines, and the like, which gentlemen generally greatly prefer.</p>
<p>An average table displays one handsomely ornamented cake, raised high on a china, glass or silver <emph rend="italic">plateau,</emph> in the centre, supported by bouquets of flowers. All the dishes are cold, of course, and may be decorated with little bits of evergreen, with flowers or with lemon in slices. Small biscuit sandwiches made of tongue and ham, or ham and potted veal, are very good. Pickled oysters, are indispensable, and sardines, and chicken, or lobster salad, will be found very popular. Jellies, fruit, one or more baskets of mixed cake, and whatever is thought requisite in the way of confectionery, should be arranged tastefully so as to produce the best

<p>It would be much better if no wines were offered New Year's day,--if beverages were limited to coffee, lemonade, and cold water; but as most persons seem to think otherwise, it would be Quixotic to attempt here to stem the tide of fashionable opinion. Cherry, old Bourbon, and claret punch are in great demand where they are to be found. Coffee is always served from a side table.</p>

For our family dinner party however, we have no soups; but we have two kinds of fish,--baked salmon trout, with anchovy sauce, and boiled white fish, with caper sauce. We have, also, small side dishes of lobster and chicken salad; pickles, and glass dishes of white, crimped celery, and cranberry jelly. The fish is followed by a roast turkey with its necklace of sausages, or a roast fowl, and dish of stewed pigeons,; and these are accompanied by an army of vegetables, sauces, and gravies. A boiled ham makes it appearance, but it is chiefly ornamental. The next course is plum pudding, and then comes a dessert of white, and black grapes, oranges, apples, and nuts, Charlotte Russe, or cream puffs, and finally, coffee. Sometimes we have wine, and sometimes we don't, at family dinners.</p>

Two pyramids of ice cream will occupy the spaces next to the top and bottom dishes, and will be followed by two handsome baskets of cake, which will just leave room for a pyramid of confectionery, or a high glass dish of fruit in the centre.

Care should be taken to have abundance of plates, saucers, spoons, and napkins. Hot coffee should be served round at the beginning, and champagne punch at the close; or if not that, claret punch.

A variety of cake with jelly, and ice cream, are perhaps the most frequently employed, with or without wine. Coffee, and little biscuit sandwiches, with cake, and fruit, are sometimes substituted.</p>
<p>At simple receptions, a cup of tea, or coffee, and a little cake, or biscuit is all that is required.</p>
<p>Do not, however, confine yourself to lady-fingers, or any of the polite forms of starvation. If you have only tea and cake, let the tea be good, and the cake good; and allow your visitors the privilege of having their cups refilled.</p>

Little baked custards in cups, apple snow, ice cream, baskets of kisses, lady-fingers, and "christmas cakes for good children" [see Sweet Cakes], small apple tarts, oranges, and mottoes, with water and lemonade, constitute a sufficient, and to juveniles, a most attractive variety.

Fifteen or twenty dollars more, will supply all the refreshments, in the shape of cake, and ice cream, and home made jellies, or fruits needed. An improvised Santa Claus distributes the gifts by lot at a certain hour, then follows refreshments, and the evening closes with dancing, and perhaps a game of blind man's buff.</p>

<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">WASHING DAY.</purpose>
This is the dreaded event of every household, large, and small; is proverbially associated with wretchedness and discomfort, and many have been the plans, methods, and receipts, which have been imposed upon housekeepers, through their desire to relieve themselves of this constantly recurring source of trouble and annoyance.</p>
<p>Such efforts, are mostly vain, and useless however, sometimes worse--positively injurious. Clean clothes are a luxury, that must be paid for in some shape or other--and no substances have been discovered, and few machines invented, to rival the stout arm, and strong hand of the professional wash-woman.</p>
<p>Never use soda to soften water, it rots the clothes in proportion to its strength; buy crude borax by the pound, and put in half an ounce for an ordinary washing; it whitens, and cleanses, and softens, wonderfully, and injures nothing. The women of Holland, whose washing is proverbial use borax.</p>
<p>Use a really good brand of <ingredient>soap</ingredient> well dried--not the soft, gelatinous, yellow bars, which melt away in a moment, and really stain rather than cleanse the clothes, and always destroy the hands.</p>
<p>Have the clothes soaked over night in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> rubbing all creased and soiled places with <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> and they will require only one washing, and that not a laborious one, before boiling. Boil quick, rinse thoroughly, wring through a first-rate <implement>clothes wringer,</implement> (the barbarism of wringing by hand, is now happily at an end) and bring them in, and fold them as soon as they are dry. Fine shirts, ruffles, and linen, and cambric under clothing, are much injured by being exposed an unnecessary length of time to frost, wind, or dust.</p>

<hd align="center">THE COWS.</hd>
<p>Attend very particularly to the food and drink of the cows; and see that they have clean pasture of timothy, or herds grass, and have pure, clean, water to drink. If cows are suffered to run where they can find such things as leaves, garlic, and weeds, they will often eat them, and drink stagnant water; all of which tend to give a bad flavor to butter.</p>
</section>
<formula class="farmgarden">
<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">THE MILK ROOM.</purpose>
The milk room is much cooler when situated on the north side of the house, where it is not exposed to the hot sun through the whole day; or the shade of large tall trees is very beneficial. The object should be to have it as cool as possible, without being damp. The room and utensils should be kept as clean and sweet, as hot and cold water and pure air, can make them. Close watchfulness of the milk is required; if it stands too long, it will make bad flavored butter, less of it, and will require more labor to churn and work it. Strain your <ingredient>milk</ingredient> into shallow pans; it should not stand over thirty-six hours; if your pans have no legs, that raise them a little from the shelves, place small blocks of marble or wood, under them, so that the air can circulate under them. When washing dairy pans, and pails always put <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in them first and wash thoroughly; add a little <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> if you prefer it.</p>

<p><purpose placement="heading" align="center">MAKING BUTTER.</purpose>
Cream should not be kept more than two days in summer, and if there is sufficient cream to churn daily, it is better to do so. Skim the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> before it becomes very sour; pass a silver spoon

handle around the edge of the pan, lift the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with a <implement>perforated skimmer,</implement> and put it immediately into the <implement>cream crock;</implement> stir the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> two or three times each day briskly until it is ready to churn, when usually it will come quickly. Churning should be done, during warm weather, early in the morning in a cool place; the <implement>dasher</implement> ought to be moved slowly and regularly at first, and then more brisk until the butter separates from the <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> when it is gathered, wet the bowl and ladle, first with a little <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and then put plenty of <ingredient>cold or ice water</ingredient> to them; pour out the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and take up the butter; drain off as much of the <ingredient>butter-milk,</ingredient> as possible, pressing the butter a moment gently with the ladle.</p>
<p>Scatter a handful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in the bowl before putting in the butter; then throw a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> upon the butter, and mix it in; drain off all the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and make indentations in the butter with the ladle, fill them with nice <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and set the bowl in a cool place. At evening, when the butter is hard, work it gently, without breaking the grain, and squeeze out all the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> that can be removed without too much pressure. <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> to the taste, and let it stand until morning, then finish it, making it into rolls, or packing it. When it is finished and becomes hard or set, every working over or changing from one vessel to another injures it, rendering it soft, and pasty, and breaking the grain. It will never again be as firm or nice in flavor, and will not keep sweet as long. If the butter is for packing, put it in the <implement>firkin</implement> as soon as possible, from the air. Pack close until nearly full, for room should be left to pour on enough nice <ingredient>brine</ingredient> to cover the butter. This is made by pouring <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> upon <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and when it is cold, straining it through a cloth. Pour enough of this <ingredient>brine</ingredient> upon the butter to cover it, say a quarter of an inch, or half an inch in thickness; this kept upon butter entirely excludes the air, and keeps it sweet and good as when first packed. If it is to be sent away, pour off the <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> saturate a cloth in it, lay it on the top, and cover it with a thick layer of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>

<p>PRESIDENT GRANT is very fond of scrambled eggs and fried ham; but this must be cut thin and crisply frizzled.</p>
<p>Louis Napoleon has an inordinate liking for chocolate. He has a cup of chocolate served him while in his bath-tub every morning; and during the war in Italy, before, during, and after the battle of Solferino--a period covering three days--he ate <emph rend="italic">nothing</emph> but common cake chocolate. He had a package of it in his holsters.</p>
<p>Victoria relishes boiled mutton caper sauce. Has a hearty meal of it every day at two, when she sits down with her children. Never eats any thing at state banquets, because she dines so heartily off mutton, at two, that she has no appetite left. Also very fond of a cup of tea. During one of her visits to the camp at Aldershott, she went and peeped in at the tent of a nameless young officer, and asked him if he had any tea. He handed her his caddy, and she went in and drew it herself.</p>
<p>Princess of Prussia--Victoria's eldest daughter--is, it is reported, so extremely fond of ice-cream that she has injured her health by over-indulgence in her favorite dish.</p>
<p>Eug&#233;nie, French empress, of all things relishes an omelet with onions. This is due to her Spanish taste, which often shows itself very strongly in sometimes not very admirable ways.</p>
<p>Patti <emph rend="italic">worships</emph> boiled macaroni, with tomato sauce. Rossini, the composer, first gave her the taste for this; being himself a superb cook, he often prepared it for her bird-like palate.</p>
<p>Louis XII., when he invaded Italy, made many cooks prisoners; many of their good dishes we still enjoy. Emperors may perish--the <emph rend="italic">fricass&#233;e</emph> will survive.</p>
<p>From the days of Leo X., we have the <emph rend="italic">fricandeau,</emph> that delicious dish of veal. Larded, spiced, and surrounded by vegetables,

<p>To this period of luxury we are indebted also for the introduction of forks. The Romans knew them not. Mankind required five thousand five hundred and some years to invent the <emph rend="italic">fricandeau</emph> and the use of forks.</p>
<p>Louis XIV. became very fastidious about his table, and Madame de Maintenon originated her celebrated cutlets, <emph rend="italic">(C&#244;telettes &#224; la Maintenon.)</emph> She steamed them first for an hour with mushrooms, shallots, parsley, and butter, then added pepper and salt, and small pieces of bacon, cut in the form of a heart; wrapped them in oiled letter-paper, and broiled them on a very slow fire, so that the paper absorbed all the fat; lastly was added a large spoonful of <emph rend="italic">velont&#233;e</emph> sauce, composed of the yolks of three eggs beaten to a cream, lemon-juice, and a minute portion of Spanish pepper. What a tender proof of loving solicitude! From that time also dates the invention of <emph rend="italic">liqueurs.</emph> Distillation and the alchemist's art were brought to Europe by the Crusaders. Brandy was not generally used before Louis XIV.'s time.</p>
<p>Under Louis XV., Madame de Pompadour invented the <emph rend="italic">"tables volantes,"</emph> (flying tables,) which descended and ascended from the kitchen, somewhat similar to the <implement>dumb-waiters</implement> of modern invention.</p>

For instance, the "stuffing" of a turkey, a work she has just accomplished, and which we regard marvelous--her mode is so different, I have asked her receipt for you, that you may introduce it in your next edition as the Partingtonian method. The "stuffing" is made of pounded <ingredient>bread-crumbs</ingredient> or <ingredient>cracker,</ingredient> <ingredient>sweet-marjoram,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> mixed as hard as the dough of hard gingerbread. This is for 
 
<pb n="359" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=jenn&#38;PageNum=373"/>
the cavity of the <emph rend="italic">crop</emph> alone, which may be extended by breaking off the <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and filling the skin thereof. This stuffing, with a rich <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> is delicious. The body of the turkey is seasoned with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> the amount according to the size of the turkey--half a tea-spoonful of each for a small one. The basting must be as described by you, minus the sausages. Now this, my dear Mrs. C., is a toothsome thing, as I could convince you, were you here to-morrow. Mrs. S. does not criticise--only wonders. She likes the book very much, and thinks it very valuable for new housekeepers--your specific and intelligent directions being, she regards, admirable, as I certainly do. I have never seen so much wholesome counsel given in a book of the kind--indeed, none that is possible to be made practicable. I think I shall be doing my daughter the best possible service by giving her the copy that came to us from the publishers as a Christmas present. I thank you for the copy you sent me. That Mrs. S. will not part with.</p>
<p>Yours ever truly,</p>
