<hd align="center" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>THE present volume is designed as a sequel to my book, entitled "Directions for cookery in all its Branches." Since the first appearance of that work, I have introduced into the new editions so many improvements and additional receipts that its size can no longer be conveniently increased. While obtaining fresh accessions of valuable knowledge on this and other subjects connected with the domestic improvement of my young countrywomen, I have been induced to note down, as they presented themselves, these new items of information. And I now offer them, arranged in due form, to that most efficient of all patrons, the public.</p>
<p>Families who possess the means and the inclination to keep an excellent table, and to entertain their guests in a handsome and liberal manner, will, most probably, find in this book and its predecessor all that may be wanted for such purposes. A large number of these new receipts are of French origin; obtained from French cooks, or from persons instructed by them. And I have endeavoured to 
 
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=10"/>

render the directions as intelligible and practicable as possible; so as to be easily understood, and easily followed. I have not thought it necessary to give their titles in French, as foreign designations can rarely be comprehended, or indeed accurately pronounced, except by those who are familiar with the language. Let these and the other receipts be fairly and faithfully tried, and I trust that few, if any, will cause disappointment in the result.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">SOUPS, ETC.</hd>
<recipe class1="soups" occasion="spring">
<p><purpose>SPRING SOUP.</purpose>--Unless your dinner hour is very late, the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> for this soup should be made the day before it is wanted, and set away in a stone pan, closely covered. To make the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> take a <ingredient>knuckle of veal,</ingredient> break the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> and cut it into several pieces. Allow a quart of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to each pound of <ingredient>veal.</ingredient> Put it into a <implement>soup-pot,</implement> with a set of <ingredient>calves-feet,</ingredient> and some bits of <ingredient>cold ham,</ingredient> cut off near the hock. If you have no <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> sprinkle in a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and a salt-spoon of <ingredient>cayenne.</ingredient> Place the pot over a <emph rend="italic">moderate</emph> fire, and let it simmer slowly (skimming it well) for several hours, till the <ingredient>veal</ingredient> is all to rags and the flesh of the <ingredient>calves-feet</ingredient> has dropped in, shreds from the <ingredient>bones.</ingredient> Then strain the soup; and if not wanted that day, set it away in a stone pan, as above mentioned.</p>
<p>Next day have ready-boiled two quarts or more of <ingredient>green peas,</ingredient> (they must on no account be old,) and a pint of the green tops cut off from <ingredient>asparagus</ingredient> boiled for the purpose. Pound a handful of raw <ingredient>spinach</ingredient> till you have extracted a teacup-full of the juice. Set the soup or <ingredient>stock</ingredient> over the fire; add the <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> <ingredient>asparagus,</ingredient> and <ingredient>spinach-juice,</ingredient> stirring them well in; also a quarter of a pound of fresh <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> divided into four bits, and rolled in <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Let the whole come to a boil; and then take it off and transfer it to a <implement>tureen.</implement> It will be found excellent.</p>
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=14"/>

<p>In boiling the <ingredient>peas</ingredient> for this soup, you may put with them half a dozen sprigs of <ingredient>green mint,</ingredient> to be afterwards taken out.</p>
<p>Late in the spring you may add to the other vegetables two <ingredient>cucumbers,</ingredient> pared and sliced, and the whitest part or <ingredient>heart of a lettuce,</ingredient> boiled together; then well-drained, and put into the soup with the <ingredient>peas</ingredient> and <ingredient>asparagus.</ingredient> It must be very thick with vegetables.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="soups" occasion="summer">
<p><purpose>SUMMER SOUP.</purpose>--Take a large <ingredient>neck of mutton,</ingredient> and hack it so as nearly to cut it apart, but not quite. Allow a small quart of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to each pound of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and sprinkle on a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a very little <ingredient>black pepper.</ingredient> Put it into a <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and boil it <emph rend="italic">slowly</emph> (skimming it well) till the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is reduced to rags. Then strain the liquid, return it to the <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and carefully remove all the fat from the surface. Have ready half a dozen small <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> sliced thin, two young <ingredient>onions</ingredient> sliced, a table-spoonful of <ingredient>sweet-marjoram leaves</ingredient> picked from the stalks, and a quart of shelled <ingredient>Lima beans.</ingredient> Put in the vegetables, and boil them in the soup till they are thoroughly done. You may add to them two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>green nasturtian seeds,</ingredient> either fresh or pickled. Put in also some little <ingredient>dumplings,</ingredient> (made of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient>) about ten minutes before the soup is done.</p>
<p><variation>Instead of <ingredient>Lima beans,</ingredient> you may divide a <ingredient>cauliflower</ingredient> or two <ingredient>broccolis</ingredient> into sprigs, and boil them in the soup with the other vegetables.</variation></p>
<p><variation>This soup may be made of a <ingredient>shoulder of mutton,</ingredient> cut into pieces and the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> cracked.</variation></p>
</recipe><recipe class1="soups" occasion="fall">
<p><purpose>AUTUMN SOUP.</purpose>--Begin this soup as early in the day as possible. Take six pounds of the <ingredient>lean of fine fresh beef;</ingredient> cut it into small pieces; sprinkle it with a tea-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> (not more); put it into a <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and 
 
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=15"/>

pour on six quarts of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> The <ingredient>hock of a cold ham</ingredient> will greatly improve it. Set it over a moderate fire, and let it boil slowly. After it comes to a boil skim it well. Have ready a quarter of a peck of <ingredient>ochras</ingredient> cut into very thin round slices, and a quarter of a peck of <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> cut into pieces; also a quart of shelled <ingredient>Lima beans.</ingredient> Season them with <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient> Put them in; and after the whole has boiled three hours <emph rend="italic">at least,</emph> take six ears of young <ingredient>Indian corn,</ingredient> and having grated off all the grain, add them to the soup and boil it an hour longer. Before you serve up the soup remove from it all the bits of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> which, if the soup is sufficiently cooked, will be reduced to shreds.</p>
<p>You may put in with the <ingredient>ochras</ingredient> and <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> one or two sliced <ingredient>onions.</ingredient> The soup, when done, should be as thick as a jelly.</p>
<p><ingredient>Ochras</ingredient> for soup may be kept all winter, by tying them separately to a line stretched high across the store-room.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="soups" occasion="winter">
<p><purpose>WINTER SOUP.</purpose>--The day before you make the soup, get a <ingredient>fore-leg or shin of beef.</ingredient> Have the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> sawed through in several places, and the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> notched or scored down to the <ingredient>bone.</ingredient> This will cause the juice or essence to come out more freely, when cooked. Rub it slightly with <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> cover it, and set it away. Next morning, early as possible, as soon as the fire is well made up, put the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> into a large <implement>soup-pot,</implement> allowing to each pound a small quart of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Then taste the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and if the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> that has been rubbed on the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is not sufficient, add a very little more. Throw in also a tea-spoonful of whole <ingredient>pepper-corns;</ingredient> and you may add half a dozen blades of <ingredient>mace.</ingredient> Let it simmer slowly till it comes to a boil; then skim it well. After it boils, you may quicken the fire. At nine o'clock put in a large head of <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> cut fine as for cold-slaw; a dozen <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> sliced; the leaves stripped from a bunch of <ingredient>sweet-marjoram;</ingredient> and 

<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=16"/>

the leaves of a sprig of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> minced fine. An hour afterwards, add six <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> and three <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> all cut into four or eight pieces. Also two <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> which will be better if previously roasted brown, and then sliced. Keep the soup boiling steadily, but not hard, unless the dinner hour is very early. For a late dinner, there will be time to boil it slowly all the while; and all soups are the better for long and slow boiling. See that it is well skimmed, so that, when done, there will be not a particle of fat or scum on the surface. At dinner-time take it up with a large ladle, and transfer it to a <implement>tureen.</implement> In doing so, carefully avoid the shreds of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone.</ingredient> Leave them all in the bottom of the pot, pressing them down with the ladle. A mass of shreds in the <implement>tureen</implement> or <implement>soup-plate</implement> looks slovenly and disgusting, and should never be seen at the table; also, they absorb too much of the liquid. Let the vegetables remain in the soup when it is served up, but pick out every shred of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> or <ingredient>bone</ingredient> that may be found in the <implement>tureen</implement> when ready to go to table.</p>
<p>In very cold weather, what is left of this soup will keep till the second day; when it must be simmered again over the fire, till it just comes to a boil. Put it away in a tin or stone vessel. The lead which is used in glazing earthen jars frequently communicates its poison to liquids that are kept in them.</p>
</recipe><recipe class1="soups">
<p><purpose>RABBIT SOUP.</purpose>--Begin this soup six hours before dinner. Cut up three large, but young and tender <ingredient>rabbits,</ingredient> or four small ones, (scoring the backs,) and dredge them with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Slice six mild <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> and season them with half a grated <ingredient>nutmeg;</ingredient> or more, if you like it. Put some fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into a hot frying pan, (you may substitute for the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> some <ingredient>cold roast-veal gravy</ingredient> that has been carefully cleared from the fat,) place it over the fire, and when it boils, put in the <ingredient>rabbits</ingredient> and <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=17"/>

and fry them a light brown. Then transfer the whole to a <implement>soup-pot;</implement> season it with a very small tea-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a tea-spoonful of <ingredient>whole pepper,</ingredient> a large tea-spoonful of <ingredient>sweet-marjoram leaves</ingredient> stripped from the stalks, and four or five blades of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> adding three large <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> in slices. Pour on, slowly, four quarts of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> from a kettle already boiling hard. Cover the <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and let it simmer slowly (skimming it well) till the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> of the <ingredient>rabbits</ingredient> is reduced to shreds, and drops from the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> which will not be in less than five hours, if boiled as gently as it ought. When quite done, strain the soup into a <implement>tureen.</implement> Have ready the grated <ingredient>yolks of six hard boiled eggs,</ingredient> and stir them into the soup immediately after it is strained, and while it is very hot. Add, also, some <ingredient>bread</ingredient> cut into dice or small squares, and fried brown in fresh <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Or substitute for the <ingredient>fried bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>buttered toast,</ingredient> with all the crust removed, and cut into very small bits or mouthfuls.</p>
<p><variation><purpose>Hare soup</purpose> may be made in this manner.</variation> <variation>It is also an excellent way of disposing of <purpose><alt synonym1="soup of old fowls">old fowls.</alt></purpose></variation> <variation>A similar <purpose><alt synonym1="venison soup">soup</alt></purpose> may be made of fresh-killed <ingredient>venison.</ingredient></variation></p>
<p><variation>For <ingredient>hare</ingredient> or <ingredient>venison</ingredient> soup, add, (after straining it,) about half an hour before you take it up, two glasses of <ingredient>sherry</ingredient> or <ingredient>Madeira,</ingredient> and a <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> sliced thin.</variation></p>
</recipe><recipe class1="soups">
<p><purpose>CHICKEN SOUP.</purpose>--Cut up two large fine <ingredient>fowls,</ingredient> as if carving them for the table, and wash the pieces in <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Take half a dozen thin slices of <ingredient>cold ham,</ingredient> and lay them in a <implement>soup-pot,</implement> mixed among the pieces of <ingredient>chicken.</ingredient> Season them with a very little <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> a little <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> and a few blades of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> but no salt, as the <ingredient>ham</ingredient> will make it salt enough. Add a head of <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> split and cut into long bits, a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> divided in two, and rolled in <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Pour on three quarts of <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Set the <implement>soup-pot</implement> over the fire, and let it boil rather slowly, 
 
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=18"/>

skimming it well. When it has boiled an hour, put in some small round <ingredient>dumplings,</ingredient> made of half a pound of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> mixed with a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> divide this dough into equal portions, and roll them in your hands into little balls about the size of a large hickory nut. The soup must boil till the flesh of the <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> is loose on the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> but not till it drops off. Stir in, at the last, the beaten <ingredient>yolks of three or four eggs;</ingredient> and let the soup remain about five minutes longer over the fire. Then take it up. Cut off from the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> the flesh of the <ingredient>fowls,</ingredient> and divide it into mouthfuls. Cut up the slices of <ingredient>ham</ingredient> in the same manner. Mince the <ingredient>livers</ingredient> and <ingredient>gizzards.</ingredient> Put the bits of <ingredient>fowl</ingredient> and <ingredient>ham</ingredient> in the bottom of a large <implement>tureen,</implement> and pour the soup upon it.</p>
<p>This soup will be found excellent, and may be made of large <ingredient>old fowls,</ingredient> that cannot be cooked in any other way. If they are so old that when the soup is finished they still continue tough, remove them entirely, and do not serve them up in it.</p>

<p><purpose>DUCK SOUP.</purpose>--Half roast a pair of fine large tame <ingredient>ducks;</ingredient> keeping them half an hour at the fire, and saving the <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> the fat of which must be carefully skimmed off. Then cut them up; season them with <ingredient>black pepper;</ingredient> and put them into a <implement>soup-pot</implement> with four or five small <ingredient>onions</ingredient> sliced thin, a small bunch of <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> a thin slice of <ingredient>cold ham</ingredient> cut into pieces, a grated <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yellow rind of a lemon</ingredient> pared thin, and cut into bits. Add the <ingredient>gravy of the ducks.</ingredient> Pour on, slowly, three quarts of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> from a kettle. Cover the <implement>soup-pot,</implement> and set it over a moderate fire. Simmer it slowly (skimming it well) for about four hours, or till the flesh of the <ingredient>ducks</ingredient> is dissolved into small shreds. When done, strain it through

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p><purpose>AN EXCELLENT WAY OF BOILING CABBAGE.</purpose>--Having trimmed the <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> and washed it well in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> (examining the leaves to see that no insects are lurking among them,) cut it almost into quarters, but do not divide it entirely down at the stem, which should be cut off just below the termination of the leaves. Let it lie an hour in a pan of <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Have ready a pot <emph rend="italic">full</emph> of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> seasoned with a small tea-spoonful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Put the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> into it, and let it boil for an hour and a half, skimming it occasionally. Then take it out; put it into a <implement>cullender</implement> to drain, and when all the <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> has drained off, set it under the <implement>hydrant.</implement> Let the <implement>hydrant</implement> run on it, till the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> has become perfectly cold all through. If you have no <implement>hydrant,</implement> set it under a pump, or keep pouring <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> on it from a pitcher. Then, having thrown out all the first <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and washed the pot, fill it again, and let the second <ingredient>water</ingredient> boil. During this time the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> under the <implement>hydrant</implement> will be growing cold. Then put it on again in the second <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and boil it two hours, or two and a half. Even the thickest part of the stalk must be perfectly tender all through. When thoroughly done, take up the <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> drain it well through the <implement>cullender,</implement> pressing it down with a broad ladle to squeeze out all the moisture; lay it in a deep dish, and cut it <emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> apart, dividing it into quarters. Lay some bits of fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> among the leaves, add a little <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> cover the dish, and send it to table hot.</p>
<p>This receipt for boiling <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> was obtained from a physician, and on trial has been found very superior to any other. <ingredient>Cabbage</ingredient> cooked in this manner loses its unpleasant

<p>This salad dressing was invented by the <attribution>Rev. Sydney Smith,</attribution> whose genius as a writer and a wit is well-known on both sides the Atlantic. If <emph rend="italic">exactly</emph> followed, it will be found very fine on trial; no peculiar flavour predominating, but excellent as a whole. The above directions are taken from a manuscript receipt given by Mr. Smith to an American gentleman then in London.</p>
<p>In preparing this, or any other salad-dressing, take care not to use that excessively pungent and deleterious combination of drugs which is now so frequently imposed upon the public, as <emph rend="italic">the best white wine vinegar.</emph> In reality, it has no vinous material about it, and it may be known by its violent and disagreeable sharpness, which overpowers and destroys the taste (and also the substance) of whatever it is mixed with.

Then squeeze or press down the point of the cone; straighten the sides; and flatten the top, so as to give it the shape of a hat crown. Next, cut off from the top a thick, round slice, and lay it aside for the lid, and another slice for the ornaments. With one hand make a hollow in the large mass of dough, and with the other shape out and smooth the sides, leaving enough for a crust at the bottom. In this manner, hollow it into the shape of a straight-sided pan, leaving the wall or crust so thick that it will stand alone. Then fill it with the <ingredient>bones of the poultry or game,</ingredient> and some <ingredient>crusts of bread</ingredient> to keep it in shape. The portion of dough reserved for the lid must then be moulded on the inverted bottom of a deep plate, previously buttered. The lid may be a little larger than the top of the pie.

Next loosen the flesh from the breast, and back, and body; and then from the thighs. It requires care and patience to do it nicely, and to avoid tearing or breaking the skin.

<p><purpose>RENNETS.</purpose>--Milk turned into a curd with wine, is by no means so good as that which is done with rennet-water alone. The curd and whey do not separate so completely: the curd is less firm, and the whey less clear; the latter being thick and white, instead of thin and greenish as it ought to be. Neither is it so light and wholesome as when turned with rennet.</p>
<p>Rennets of the best quality can be had at all seasons in Philadelphia market; particularly in the lower part, called the Jersey market. They are sold at twelve, eighteen, or twenty-five cents, according to their size, and will keep a year or two; but have most strength when fresh. You may prepare excellent rennets yourself at a very trifling expense, by previously bespeaking them of a veal butcher; a rennet being the <ingredient>stomach of a calf.</ingredient> Its form is a bag. As soon as you get the <ingredient>rennet,</ingredient> empty out all its contents, and wipe it very clean, inside and out; then rinse it with <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> but do not wash it much, as washing will weaken its power of turning milk into curd. When you have made it quite clean, lay the rennet in a broad pan, strew it over on both sides with plenty of <ingredient>fine salt;</ingredient> cover it, and let it rest five days. When you take it out of the pan, do not wipe or wash it, for it must be stretched and dried with the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on. For this purpose hold it open like a bag, and slip within it a long, thick, smooth rod, bent into the form of a large loop; 
 
<pb n="164" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=170"/>

wide at the top, and so narrow at the bottom as to meet together. Stretch the rennet tightly and smoothly over this bent rod, on which it will be double, and when you have brought the two ends of the rod together at the bottom, and tied them fast, the form will somewhat resemble that of a boy's kite. Hang it up in a dry place, and cut out a bit as you want it. A piece about two inches square will turn one quart of milk, a piece of four inches two quarts. Having first washed off all the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> in several cold waters, and wiped the bit of rennet dry; pour on it sufficient <ingredient><emph rend="italic">lukewarm</emph> water</ingredient> to cover it well. Let it stand several hours; then pour the rennet-water into the milk you intend for the curd, and set it in a warm place. When the curd is entirely formed, set the vessel on ice.</p>

In the morning, drain the <ingredient>citron</ingredient> from the <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> and wash every piece separately in the <ingredient>alum-water,</ingredient> which will green and clear it. After it has lain half an hour in the <ingredient>alum-water,</ingredient> drain the <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> and put it into a porcelain <implement>preserving-kettle,</implement> allowing to every four pounds of the <ingredient>citron</ingredient> a large half pint of clear fresh <ingredient>water.</ingredient> There must be <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover the <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> and keep it from burning.

Set the kettle over a clear fire, and boil it slowly, till the <ingredient>citron</ingredient> is tender enough to be easily pierced through with a large needle. If it seems to be boiling dry, add a little more <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> When all are quite tender, take out each piece separately with a fork. Spread them out on a large dish.

Cover the tops with white paper, dipped in brandy, and tie closely over each another covering of bladder, that has been previously soaked in <ingredient>water.</ingredient> The covers of lacquered tin, that belong to glass jars, seldom fit perfectly tight, and are not to be trusted without another covering over them.</p>
<p>This will be found a very fine sweetmeat.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy">
<p><purpose>TO BEAT EGGS.</purpose>--In making cakes it is of the utmost importance that the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> should be properly and sufficiently beaten; otherwise the cakes will most certainly be deficient in the peculiar lightness characterizing those that are made by good confectioners. Home-made cakes, if good in other respects, are too frequently (even when not absolutely heavy or streaked) hard, solid and tough. This often proceeds from too large a portion of flour, and too small an allowance of butter and <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> The richest cake that can be made (provided it is light and well baked) is less unwholesome than what are called plain cakes, if they are solid or leathery. Cakes cannot be crisp and light without a due proportion of the articles that are to make them so; and even then, the ingredients must be thoroughly stirred or beaten; and of course thoroughly baked afterwards.</p>
<p>Persons who do not know the right way, complain much of the fatigue of beating <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and therefore leave off too soon. There will be no fatigue, if they are beaten with the proper stroke, and with <emph rend="italic">wooden</emph> rods, and in a shallow, flat-bottomed <emph rend="italic">earthen</emph> pan. The coldness of a tin pan retards the lightness of the <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> For the same reason do not use a metal <implement>egg-beater.</implement> In beating them do not move your elbow, but keep it close to your side. Move only your hand at the wrist, and let the stroke be quick, short, and horizontal; putting the <implement>egg-beater</implement> always down to the bottom of the pan, which should therefore be shallow. Do not leave off as soon as you have got the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> into a foam; they are then only <emph rend="italic">beginning</emph> to be light. But persist till after the foaming has ceased, 
 
<pb n="194" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=200"/>

and the bubbles have all disappeared. Continue till the surface is smooth as a mirror, and the beaten <ingredient>egg</ingredient> as thick as a rich boiled custard; for till then it will not be really light. It is seldom necessary to beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> separately, if they are afterwards to be put together. The article will be quite as light, when cooked, if the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> are beaten together, and there will then be no danger of their going in streaks when baked. The justly-celebrated Mrs. Goodfellow, of Philadelphia, always taught her pupils to beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> together, even for sponge-cake; and lighter than hers no sponge-cake could possibly be.</p>
<p>When <ingredient>white of egg</ingredient> is to be used without any <ingredient>yolk,</ingredient> (as for lady-cake, maccaroons, meringues, icing, &#38;c.,) it should be beaten till it stands alone on the rods; not falling when held up.</p>
<p><implement>Hickory rods</implement> for egg-beating are to be had at the wooden-ware shops, or at the turner's. For stirring butter and sugar together, nothing is equal to a <implement>wooden spaddle.</implement> It should be about a foot long, and flattened at the end like that of a <implement>mush-stick,</implement> only broader. Spoons are very tedious and inconvenient either for beating <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> or stirring butter and sugar, and do not produce the proper lightness.</p>

<p><purpose>BOSTON CAKE.</purpose>--Put a pound of <ingredient>powdered white sugar</ingredient> into a deep pan, and cut up in it a pound of fresh <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Stir the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> together till perfectly light. Then add a powdered <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> a table-spoonful of powdered <ingredient>mace</ingredient> and <ingredient>cinnamon</ingredient> mixed together, and a large wine-glass of excellent <ingredient>brandy.</ingredient> If the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> is of bad quality it will give the cake a disagreeable taste. If very good, it will highly improve the flavour, and also add to the lightness of the cake. Sift into a pan a pound of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> In another pan beat six <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> till very thick and 
 
<pb n="195" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=201"/>

smooth. Stir them gradually into the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> alternately with the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and a pint of <ingredient>rich milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> a little of each at a time. Have ready a level tea-spoonful (not heaped) of <ingredient>pearlash,</ingredient> or <ingredient>sal-eratus,</ingredient> (or a full tea-spoonful of <ingredient>bi-carbonate of soda,</ingredient>) dissolved in as much <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> as will cover it. Add this at the last, and then give the whole a very hard stirring. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> a large square pan. Put in the mixture. Set it immediately into the oven, and bake it thoroughly. It requires very long baking. A thick square Boston cake will scarcely be done in less than three hours. At the end of the first hour, increase the heat of the oven, and also at the second. When cool, sift <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> over it, and cut it into squares.</p>
<p>If properly made, and well-baked, (following exactly the above directions,) this cake will be found excellent, and will seem fresh longer than any other; the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> keeping it soft.</p>
<p><ingredient>Milk</ingredient> turned sour is very good for Boston cake; as by stirring the dissolved <ingredient>pearlash</ingredient> or <ingredient>soda</ingredient> into the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> the acidity will be entirely removed, and the alkali rendered more effective in increasing the lightness of the cake. Still great care will be necessary in baking it.</p>
<p>The best confectioners make this cake every day without any failure.</p>

<p><purpose>TO ICE A LARGE CAKE.</purpose>--It requires practice to ice cakes smoothly. It is a good rule to allow a <emph rend="italic">large</emph> quarter of a pound of <ingredient>powdered loaf-sugar</ingredient> to the <ingredient>white of every egg.</ingredient> The <ingredient>whites of four eggs</ingredient> and a pound of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> will ice a large cake. Having strained the <ingredient>white of egg</ingredient> into a broad, shallow pan, beat it to a stiff froth with <implement>hickory rods</implement> or a large silver fork. It must be beaten till it stands alone. Have ready the <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> in a bowl beside you; add it, gradually, to the beaten white

of <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> a tea-spoonful at a time, and beat it very hard. Perhaps some additional <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> may be required to make the icing sufficiently thick. Flavour it by beating in at the last a few drops of <ingredient>oil of lemon,</ingredient> or a spoonful of fresh <ingredient>lemon or orange-juice,</ingredient> or a few drops of <ingredient>extract of vanilla,</ingredient> or <ingredient>extract of roses.</ingredient> <ingredient>Lemon-juice</ingredient> will make it more adhesive, so that it will stick on better. Turn bottom-upwards the empty pan in which the cake was baked, and place this pan on a large flat dish, or an old server. Dredge the cake all over with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> to take off the greasiness of the outside, which greasiness may otherwise prevent the <ingredient>icing</ingredient> from sticking well. Then wipe off the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with a clean towel. Take up the icing with a spoon, and begin by heaping a large quantity of it on the middle of the top of the cake. Then, with a broad-bladed knife, spread it down evenly and smoothly, till the top and sides are all covered with it of an equal thickness. Have beside you a bowl of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> into which dip the knife-blade, occasionally, as you go on spreading and smoothing the icing. Put it into a warm place to harden. When nearly dry, have ready sufficient icing to ornament or flower the cake. This must be done by means of a small <implement>syringe.</implement> By working and moving this <implement>syringe</implement> skilfully, the icing will fall from it so as to form borders, beadings, wreaths, and centre-pieces, according to your taste. If you cannot procure a <implement>syringe,</implement> a substitute may be formed by rolling or folding a piece of thick, smooth writing paper into a conical or sugar-loaf form. At the large end of this cone leave paper enough to turn down all round, so as to prevent the side opening, and the icing escaping. The pointed end must be neatly cut off with scissors, leaving a small round hole, through which the icing is to be pressed out when ornamenting the cake. The hole must be cut perfectly even; otherwise the icing will come out crooked and unmanageable. These paper 
 
<pb n="220" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=226"/>

cones, in skilful hands, may succeed tolerably; but they must be continually renewed, and are far less convenient than a <implement>syringe,</implement> which can be bought at a small cost, and is always ready for use. Where much icing is to be done, it is well to have a set of <implement>syringes</implement> with the points of different patterns.</p>
<p>To decorate cakes with ornamental icing, requires practice, skill, and taste. A person that has a good knowledge of drawing can generally do it very handsomely.</p>
<p>To colour it of a beautiful pink, tie up a little <ingredient>alkanet</ingredient> in a thin <implement>muslin bag,</implement> and let it infuse in the icing after it is made, squeezing the bag occasionally. When sufficiently coloured, take out the bag, and give the icing a hard stirring or beating before you put it on. Cover the cake all over with the pink icing, and then have ready some white icing for the border and other ornaments,--to be put on with the <implement>syringe.</implement></p>
<p>Icing may be made stiffer and more adhesive by mixing with it, gradually, a small portion of dissolved <ingredient>gum tragacanth.</ingredient> This solution is prepared by melting gum tragacanth in <ingredient><emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water,</ingredient> (if wanted for immediate use,) having first picked the gum quite clean. The proportion is half an ounce of the gum to half a pint of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> It is slow in dissolving.

A tin or <implement>stone-ware</implement> box will not answer at all for this purpose, being too cold. If you burn wood-fires, set the box with the cake into a <implement>plate-warmer,</implement> or place it on a tall skillet, so as to be out of the way of coals or ashes falling on it, should the sticks break on the fire.</p>

As soon as the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is all in, put on the lid closely, and set away the pot. It is well to put the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to infuse over night, if wanted for breakfast; and in the morning, if required for evening. But, when necessary, it may be done in a much shorter time. A little before the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is to go to table, lift off the upper half of the <implement>percolator,</implement> (the part that contains the strainers,) transfer the lid to the lower part; set the pot over the fire, and give it one boil up--not more.

A short boil is sufficient to take off all taste of rawness. Long boiling weakens <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> and frequently turns it sour.</p>
<p>The above method will, we are confident, be highly approved on trial.

<p><purpose>AN EASY WAY OF MAKING BUTTER IN WINTER.</purpose>--The following will be found an excellent method of making butter in cold weather for family use. We recommend its trial. Take, in the morning, the unskimmed <ingredient>milk</ingredient> of the preceding evening, (after it has stood all night in a <emph rend="italic">tin</emph> pan,) and set it over a furnace of hot coals, or in a stove; being careful not to disturb the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> that has risen to the surface. Let it remain over the fire till it simmers, and begins to bubble round the edges; but on no account let it come to a boil. Then take the pan carefully off, (without disturbing the cream) and carry it to a cool place, but not where it is cold enough to freeze. In the evening, take a spoon, and loosen the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> round the sides of the pan. If very rich it will be almost a solid cake. Slip off the sheet of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> into another and larger pan; letting as little <ingredient>milk</ingredient> go with it as possible. Cover it, and set it away. Repeat the process for several days, till you have thus collected a sufficiency of clotted <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to fill the pan. Then scald a wooden ladle, and beat the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> hard with it during ten minutes. You will then have excellent butter. Take it out of the pan; lay it on a flat dish; and with the ladle, squeeze and press it hard, till all the butter-milk is entirely extracted and drained off. Then wash the butter in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and work a very little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> into it. Set it away in a cool place for three hours. Then squeeze and press it again; also washing it a second time in <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Make it up into pats, and keep it in a cool place.</p>
<p>The unskimmed morning's <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> of course, may also be used for this purpose, after it has stood twelve hours. The simmering over the fire adds greatly to the quantity 
 
<pb n="250" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=256"/>

of <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> by throwing all the oily part of the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to the surface; but if allowed to boil, this oleaginous matter will again descend, and mix with the rest, so as not to be separated.</p>
<p>This is the usual method of making winter butter in the south of England; and it is very customary in the British provinces of America. Try it.</p>

There is no danger of any such accidents, if the newspaper is merely moistened, or damped throughout; without being so wet as to drip. After the glass has been well rubbed, with the damp paper, let it rest a minute. Then go over it with a fresh newspaper, (folded small in your hand,) till it looks clear and bright; which it will, almost immediately. Finish with a fresh piece of newspaper, thoroughly dry.</p>

This <ingredient>almond cream</ingredient> (which must not be confounded with another preparation called Amandine) is, when fresh, very soft and white, and resembles ice-cream in appearance.

Rub it well into your hands and all over them before you wash it off. We know, by experience, that this is the best of all preparation for keeping the hands in nice order. If used every day, it will effectually prevent the skin from chapping in cold weather; and will remove any roughness caused by incidental employments, or by putting the hands into salt water. We earnestly recommend it. Keep it closely covered. If you live where it can be easily procured, do not get more than one <implement>gallicup</implement> at a time, as <ingredient>almond cream</ingredient> is always best when freshly made.

<p><purpose>TO PREVENT A JUG OF MOLASSES FROM RUNNING OVER.</purpose>--A jug or bottle of molasses frequently causes inconvenience by working over at the top, after coming from the grocer's, and being set in a room or closet that is warmer than the place from which it was brought. To prevent this--as soon as you receive it, pour out a portion into another vessel; for instance, into 
 
<pb n="295" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=301"/>

a pitcher or bowl. Then set the jug of molasses into a deep pan or basin, and leave it <emph rend="italic">uncorked</emph> till next day. By that time, all danger from fermentation will have subsided. Then cork it tightly, and set it away. Keep always under the bottom of the jug an old plate, or a double piece of thick paper to receive any drippings that may run down the sides. Never bring molasses to table without a plate or saucer under the vessel that contains it.</p></formula>

<p>West India molasses is far more wholesome and nourishing than any other, and is decidedly the best for gingerbread, molasses-candy, indian-puddings, &#38;c. Sugar-house molasses, if used for those articles, will render them hard and tough.</p>

<p><purpose>TO EXTINGUISH A COAL FIRE.</purpose>--Many persons who burn anthracite coal in their chambers, have suffered great inconvenience from not knowing how to extinguish it before they go to bed. The process is very simple, and always successful. Lift off with the tongs any large coals that may lie on the top, and lay them on the iron hearth of the grate; they will make good cinders to burn next day in a close-stove or furnace. Then shut up the tongs, and with them make a hollow or deep cavity just in the centre of the fire, heaping up the coals like a hill on each side, and making the tongs go down to the bottom of the grate. If there are not many coals, you may do this with the <implement>poker.</implement> The fire will immediately begin to fade and deaden; and in less than ten minutes, it will be entirely out, without farther trouble; unless it has been very large, and then it may require a second stirring.</p>
<p>In the morning, let the grate be cleared <emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> of all the cinders and ashes, and swept out clean with a brush. Cover the bottom of the grate with a sort of flooring of small fresh <ingredient>coal,</ingredient> before you put in the kindlings; otherwise,

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>TO MAKE THREAD LACE LOOK ALWAYS NEW.</purpose>--Thread lace should never be sewed fast, or washed upon the article of which it forms the trimming.
 
<pb n="302" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=308"/>

It should be merely run on, or basted with short stitches; so as to draw out the thread easily, when the lace is taken off for washing. The trouble is nothing in comparison to the advantage. In the first place, thread lace, to look well and last long, should never be touched with starch. Starching thread lace injures the texture, (causing the threads to break,) and gives it a hard, stiff appearance. If sewed fast, and washed and done up with the muslin collar or pelerine, it shrinks and thickens up among the gathers, and partakes of the starch that has been used for the muslin; and, of course, can have no resemblance to new lace that has never been washed at all. Again, it will not last half so long, as if always taken off, and done up separately from the muslin.</p>
<p>Every lady should have at least two <implement>lace bottles,</implement> as it is not well to wind more than three or four yards of lace upon one bottle. They should be straight black bottles of the largest size, and it is well to buy them new for the purpose; otherwise something of their former contents may come out when boiling, and injure the lace. Also there may be remains of wax, rosin, or some other cement, lingering about the place where the cork was; and this will melt in the water, and cause the lace to look streaked. The bottles being perfectly clean, (inside and out,) cover them with thick, strong, new white linen, sewed on tightly and smoothly, with coarse thread. When not in use, keep them wrapped up in clean paper.</p>
<p>Having taken off the lace from the article on which it was basted, begin near the bottom of the bottle; tack one end of the lace with a needle and strong thread to the linen; and wind it smoothly round with the edge downward; and all the scollops smooth, so that none may be creased or curled inward. Wind the lace on the bottle in such a manner as to leave the scolloped or pattern-edge visible all round; and finish just below the neck of 
 
<pb n="303" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=309"/>

the bottle. Then tack down with the needle and thread the last or terminating end of the lace. Early in the evening put the bottle with the lace into a clean <emph rend="italic">earthen</emph> or <implement>white-ware</implement> vessel, filled with clear <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let it soak till bed-time. Then change the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and let it soak all night.</p>
<p>In the morning, fill a clean porcelain kettle, or a deep earthen <implement>pipkin,</implement> with a strong <ingredient>suds</ingredient> of clear <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> and the best <ingredient>white soap.</ingredient> Into this, put the bottle with the lace on it; having tied a twine string round the neck of the bottle so as to make it fast to the handles or the rim of the vessel, that it may be kept as steady as possible while boiling. It must on no account be boiled in a tin or iron vessel, as the lace will then certainly be discoloured. Set the vessel over hot coals or in a stove; and keep it boiling regularly till the lace looks quite white. If very dirty, it will be necessary to change the <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a clean fresh <ingredient>suds.</ingredient> It may boil from an hour to an hour and a half; but take it out as soon as it looks clean and white. Then turn up the bottle to drain off the <ingredient>suds,</ingredient> and set it (without rinsing) in the sun. Keep it in the sun till the lace dries on the bottle. When <emph rend="italic">quite</emph> dry, take it off; stretch or pull down each scollop separately with your thumb and finger; and then wind the lace evenly and smoothly on a <implement>ribbon-block</implement> of somewhat broader width. You can get <implement>ribbon-blocks</implement> at the stores where ribbons are sold, and you will find them very useful. Wrap the block with the lace on it in soft <emph rend="italic">brown</emph> paper, and put it away till you want it for use. If you have no <implement>ribbon-block,</implement> fold or roll up a piece of smooth clean paper, and roll the lace round it. Never wrap any thing in printed paper.</p>
<p>The above method of cleaning thread lace, (without rubbing, squeezing, rinsing, starching, or ironing,) as it is the most simple and easy, is also the most certain of 
 
<pb n="304" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=310"/>

success. In fact we can confidently assert that there is no other so good; and we only ask a trial of its efficacy; well-assured that every lady who has once had her lace washed in this manner will continue it; as it makes it look always new. Of course, it should be done on a clear bright day, and the hotter the sun the better. If you have more than one <implement>lace bottle</implement> to boil, they may be put into a brass or bell-metal wash-kettle, (previously made very clean,) but remember that no tin or iron must be used for this purpose. If the coating or lining of an enamelled or porcelain kettle is the least cracked or scaled off, do not boil the lace in it, or it will be stained with iron mould.</p>
<p>Thread lace done <emph rend="italic">exactly</emph> according to these directions, has the look, feel, transparency, and consistence of new lace that has never been washed at all; and may easily be mistaken for it. Drying in the <ingredient>soap-suds</ingredient> gives it just the right stiffness, and it will last much longer than if washed in the old manner with squeezing, rinsing, starching, clapping, and ironing.</p>
<p>Before your lace is sewed on the bottle, look over it, and see if it requires any mending. There is a lace-stitch done with <emph rend="italic">very fine</emph> thread, that, when neatly executed, renders a mended place imperceptible. It may be learned in a few minutes by seeing it done, but cannot be described intelligibly. Those who have had no opportunity of learning this stitch may mend lace very neatly by darning it with the finest possible thread; taking care not to make the darn too thick, or close, but imitating as nearly as possible the open texture of the lace. In quilling or setting on the lace, endeavour to conceal the darns under the pleats.</p>
<p>Cotton lace cannot be cleaned in the foregoing manner, as it is too soft and fuzzy, and shrinks up too much. It requires squeezing, starching, clapping, and ironing.</p>

Next, fold it evenly; roll it up in a thick clean towel; and let it rest for a quarter of an hour or more.</p>
<p>Spread a large clean <emph rend="italic">linen</emph> cloth on your clothes-line, and hang the veil (well spread out) upon the cloth.

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>PUTTING AWAY WOOLLENS.</purpose>--The introduction of furnaces, for the purpose of warming houses, is supposed to be one cause of the great increase of moths, cockroaches, and other insects that now, more than ever, infest our dwellings. For moths, particularly, the usual remedies of <ingredient>camphor,</ingredient> <ingredient>tobacco,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>cedar-shavings,</ingredient> &#38;c., seem no longer sufficiently powerful; perhaps because their odour so soon evaporates. Still it is well to try them when nothing better can be done; and they are sometimes successful. <ingredient>Camphor</ingredient> and <ingredient>tobacco-shreds</ingredient> will be found much more efficacious if (after interspersing them among the <ingredient>furs</ingredient> or <ingredient>woollens</ingredient>) each fur or woollen article is carefully and closely pinned up in <ingredient>newspapers;</ingredient> so closely as to leave no aperture or opening, however small. The printing-ink has a tendency to keep off moths and other small insects. The papers used for this purpose should be those that are printed with ink of a good quality, not liable to rub off, and soil the things enclosed. We highly recommend this mode of preserving furs and woollens.</p>
<p><variation>But the following method of putting away all the woollen, worsted, and fur articles of the house, will be found an <emph rend="italic">infallible</emph> preservative against moths; and the cost is trifling, in comparison with the security it affords of finding the things in good order when opened for use on the return of cold weather. Procure at a distiller's, or elsewhere, a tight empty <implement>hogshead</implement> that has held whisky. Have it well cleaned, (<emph rend="italic">without washing,</emph>) and see that it is quite dry. Let it be placed in some part of the house that is little used in the summer, where there is no damp, and where it can be shut up in entire darkness.</variation></p>
<p>After the carpets have been taken up, and well shaken 
 
<pb n="311" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=317"/>

and beaten, and the grease spots all removed, let them be folded and packed closely down in the <implement>cask,</implement> which can be reached by means of a step-ladder. Put in, also, the blankets; having first washed all that were not clean; also the woollen table-covers. If you have worsted or cloth curtains and cushion-covers, pack them in likewise, after they have been thoroughly freed from dust. Also, flannels, merinos, cloaks, coats, furs, and, in short, every thing that is liable to be attacked by the moths. It is well to rip the cloaks from the collars, and the skirts of pelisses from the bodies, before packing, as they can be folded more smoothly, and so as to occupy less space. Fold and pack all the articles closely, and arrange them to advantage, so as to fit in well, and fill up all hollows and vacancies evenly. If well-packed, one <implement>hogshead</implement> will generally hold all the woollen and fur articles belonging to a house of moderate size, and to a moderate-sized family. But if <emph rend="italic">one</emph> is not enough, it is easy to get another. When the <implement>cask</implement> is filled, nail the head on tightly, and let the whole remain undisturbed till the warm weather is over. If the house is shut up, and the family out of town in the summer, you may safely leave your woollens, &#38;c., put away in this manner. Choose a clear, dry day for unpacking them in the autumn; and, when open, expose them all separately to the air, till the odour of the whisky is gone off. If they have been put away clean, and free from dust, it will be found that the whisky-atmosphere has brightened their colours. As soon as the things are all out of the <implement>cask,</implement> head it up again <emph rend="italic">immediately,</emph> and keep it for the same use next summer. If more convenient, you may have the <implement>cask</implement> sawed in two before you pack it. In this case, you must get an extra head for one of the halves.</p>
<p>In putting away woollens for the season, always keep out a blanket for each bed, and some <implement>flannel</implement> for each

<p>TAKING CARE OF PICTURES.--An excellent way <purpose>to preserve an oil-picture from the injuries of damp, mould, and mildew,</purpose> is to take the precaution of covering the <emph rend="italic">back</emph> of the canvas (before nailing it on the straining frame) with a coating of common <ingredient>white lead paint;</ingredient> and when that is dry, give it a second coat. If you buy a picture that has been framed without this precaution, do not neglect having the back of it coated as above, before you hang it up.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>The simplest way of cleaning an oil-picture,</purpose> is to mix some <ingredient>whisky</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">very weak.</emph> If the mixture is too strong of the liquid, it may take off the paint, or otherwise injure it. Dip into the mixture a very soft and very clean sponge, which you must first ascertain to be perfectly free from sand, grit, or any extraneous object. A good way to soften and clean a sponge, is to boil it in several successive waters, till there is no longer any appearance of sand at the bottom of the vessel. Having carefully washed the picture with the sponge and <ingredient>whisky-water,</ingredient> dry it by going over it with a clean soft <emph rend="italic">silk</emph> handkerchief. This is all that can be safely attempted by 
 
<pb n="314" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=320"/>

any one who is not a regular picture cleaner. Therefore, if the picture is smoked or much soiled, it is best to send it to a person who makes picture-cleaning his profession. Many a good picture has been destroyed by injudicious cleaning.</p>
</formula>

<p>Till it has been made <emph rend="italic">perfectly clean,</emph> no picture should be re-varnished; otherwise the fresh varnish will work up the dirt, and make it look worse than ever. As long as a picture is the least wet (either with paint or varnish) it should be carefully guarded from dust; the smallest particles of which by drying into the surface will injure it irreparably. No sweeping or dusting should be permitted where there is a picture not <emph rend="italic">perfectly and thoroughly</emph> dry. If there is a fire in the room it should not be stirred, replenished, or touched in any way till the picture has been previously carried out, lest some of the flying ashes might stick to it.</p>
<p>When a picture is finished, it would always be well for the artist to inscribe on the back of the canvas the subject of the painting, the date of its completion, his own name and that of the person for whom it was painted. In short, a concise history of the picture, arranged somewhat like the title-page of a book. Had this excellent practice always prevailed, there would be no occasion for any doubts and controversies concerning the works of the old masters.</p>

<p>TRAVELLING BOXES.--As <implement>bandboxes</implement> are no longer visible among the baggage-articles of <emph rend="italic">ladies,</emph> the usual way of carrying bonnets, caps, muslins, &#38;c., is in tall square wooden boxes, covered with black canvas or leather, edged with strips of iron and brass nails, and furnished with a tray for small things. They are usually lined with paper or calico pasted all over the inside. This lining, however, is apt to peel off in places where most rubbed; and is then very troublesome; catching the corners of the tray so as to prevent its being lifted out. To obviate this inconvenience, when you bespeak the box, direct that the inside, instead of being lined with pasted paper or calico, shall be planed smooth, and either stained of some colour, or left the natural tint of the wood. It is best that the tray should have a <emph rend="italic">close</emph> bottom of strong linen. When there are only strips nailed across, (like open lattice-work,) the small articles laid upon them are always falling through.</p>
<p>A small <implement>bandbox</implement> can be easily carried <emph rend="italic">inside</emph> of a trunk or box, keeping it steady by filling in heavy articles closely round it. The best way of securing a <implement>bandbox</implement>-lid, is to have a hole made in the rim or top of the lid, and a corresponding hole in the side of the <implement>bandbox,</implement> near its cover. Through each of these holes pass a string of ribbon or ferret; securing one end by a large knot inside, and leaving the other end outside; so that you can tie them together in a bow-knot.

From this <ingredient>paper</ingredient> cut out the silk lining; allowing still more for turning in at the edges, on account of the silk ravelling. Then (having notched the edge of the lining all round) baste it on the inside of the brim, and try it on before the glass, previous to sewing it in permanently. See that it is perfectly smooth and even throughout. A white silk bonnet-lining should be of the most decided white, (a dead white, as it is called,) for if it has the least tinge of pearl, rose, blue or yellowish-white, it will be unbecoming to any face or complexion. Straw bonnets are frequently lined with white crape or tarletane.</p>

<p><purpose>TO HEM BOBBINET.</purpose>--In making a collar, pelerine, cape, scarf, or any article of <ingredient>bobbinet,</ingredient> you may hem it so as to prevent the usual inconvenience and disfigurement of the edges stretching out of shape after being washed, starched, and ironed. After turning down the hem, lay a <emph rend="italic">very small</emph> <ingredient>cotton cord</ingredient> into the upper or extreme edge of the hem, and with a fine needle and thread secure the cord by running it closely along with short

stitches. Having done this, lay a second small cord into the other edge, or the edge that is to be hemmed down. It is well worth the trouble of thus going twice round with a cord at each edge of the hem; which in consequence will remain ever firm and straight after the article has been washed.</p>
<p>When any part of a bobbinet article is cut bias, or rounded in a semicircle, it will be best, instead of hemming, to face the edge with a bias slip of the same material, having a covered cording sewed in; as in binding or facing the edge of a cape or pelerine. Without this precaution, the bias or rounded edge will lose all shape in being ironed. If new bobbinet is very stiff and full of creases, let it be damped and ironed before it is cut out. As bobbinet shrinks much in washing, every thing made of it should be allowed full large. It may be shrunk before cutting out, by dipping it into a pan or tub of <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> As soon as it is wet all through, take it out and squeeze it with your hands till it ceases entirely to drip. Then open, stretch, and pull it, till you get it all straight and even. Next, fold it up smoothly, and wrap it in a clean towel. It will be ready for ironing by the time an iron can be heated; first trying the iron on something very thin.</p>
<p>A bobbinet, or any clear muslin dress should have the hems and tucks drawn out before washing; renewing them after the dress is done up. The dress will never look well, if washed and clear-starched with the hem, &#38;c., remaining in.</p>

<p><purpose>DIRECTIONS FOR WORKING SLIPPERS.</purpose>--Half a yard of <ingredient>canvas</ingredient> is a full pattern for a large pair
 
<pb n="328" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=334"/>

of slippers. If the canvas is of extra width, three quarters of a yard will make two pair. It is well to get your shoemaker to cut out for you the size and form, in a piece of <ingredient>paper.</ingredient> They will look <emph rend="italic">immensely large</emph> before they are made up, but will not be found so afterwards.</p>
<p>Coloured engravings of slipper patterns are for sale in all the worsted and trimming stores. In making your selections, it is best to avoid those patterns that have white in them; as the white crewel will look soiled very soon, and give a dirty appearance to the whole slipper. You may, however, contrive to substitute for the white stitches the palest possible tints of pink, blue, or yellow.</p>
<p>To work one pair of slippers, you will require from fifteen to twenty skeins of <ingredient>crewel.</ingredient> In selecting the crewel, place beside you the pattern, that you may match the tints with it; choosing them so as to correspond precisely with those in the coloured engraving. It is best to go <emph rend="italic">exactly</emph> by the pattern. If varied according to your own fancy, they will rarely look as well as when done in precise conformity to the taste and judgment of the practised artist, who has designed the plate and its colouring. Generally speaking, you should have <emph rend="italic">at least</emph> from four to six shades of each colour; the darkest to be nearly black, the lightest nearly white; otherwise the effect will be dull and indistinct. Strong lights and shades are always of importance to brightness and beauty; even in worked slippers.</p>
<p>Wind the crewels, separately, in balls; and have a sufficient number of needles, so as to appropriate a needle to every shade. The needles must be large and <implement>blunt</implement>-pointed. Keep beside you, while working, something in which to stick the needles you are not using at the moment. A very simple and convenient thing for this purpose, is an empty <implement>gallicup,</implement> with a blank piece of 
 
<pb n="329" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=335"/>

canvas stretched flat, and tied tightly over the top. Stick the needles into this canvas; it is better than a pincushion.</p>
<p>Slippers (like all other worsted work) should be done in a frame, the canvas stretched tightly; and tacked firmly in, with strong thread. Keep the pattern beside you all the time you are working; and follow every stitch precisely. Do the central part first; next the heel part; and then fill up with groundwork all the vacant space within the outline. The usual way is to work them in common cross-stitch; but if done in tent-stitch or queen-stitch, the slippers will be more elastic, much softer, and will take a smaller quantity of crewel. When you have finished working them, have the slippers made up by a very good shoemaker. They will last a long time.</p>
<p><variation>Instead of canvas, you may work slippers on fine <ingredient>broad-cloth,</ingredient> such as is used for gentlemen's coats. Cloth slippers require no filling up with groundwork; having only a cluster of flowers in the centre, and a small running-pattern round the heel. You must baste upon the cloth a bit of <ingredient>canvas,</ingredient> a little larger than the space to be occupied by the flowers. Work the flowers upon this; taking every stitch quite through both the canvas and the cloth beneath it. When done, pull out the threads of the canvas from under the stitches, (they can be drawn out very easily,) and the flowers will remain in their proper form upon the cloth. This method of working slippers saves time, trouble, and crewel; yet they will be found less durable than if worked entirely on canvas, and with the whole ground filled up by crewel-stitches; cloth wearing out much sooner than worked canvas.</variation></p>
<p>When preparing to work slippers, do not have them previously cut out, as it will cause the canvas or cloth to stretch all round, and will spoil their shape; besides being very troublesome to keep straight and even while working.

<p><purpose>TO WORK MERINO IN CROSS-STITCH.</purpose>--If you determine to work <ingredient>merino</ingredient> in cross-stitch, in the common manner of worsted work, have ready a <ingredient>pattern</ingredient> accurately drawn and coloured, so as to represent the place and tint of every stitch; and keep it before you to look at.

On this canvas work the sprigs; carefully taking up with every stitch the merino beneath, as well as the canvas above it. Avoid drawing your hand too tight. When done, pull out, thread by thread, the canvas from under the needle-work; so as to leave the sprig resting on the merino only. This you will find a much more easy process than it appears on description. Have a number of needles, one for every different shade, and thread them all in advance. A <implement>tumbler</implement> or <implement>gallicup</implement> with a piece of canvas stretched tightly, and tied down over the top, is a very convenient thing to have beside you to stick your threaded needles in, when working worsted.</p>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>TO BRAID MERINO DRESSES OR CLOAKS FOR CHILDREN.</purpose>--Patterns for braiding should be as continuous as possible, so as to avoid frequent cutting off and fastening on of the braid. These patterns should
 
<pb n="331" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=337"/>

have nothing in them that stops short; all the parts following and entwining, so as to connect with each other.</p>
<p>For braiding, the dress must be cut out first, and the breadths sewed together, so that the border may run smoothly and regularly along, without any breaks or ill-joined places. Wind your <ingredient>braid</ingredient> upon cards or corks, and reserve a sufficiency for raveling to sew on the rest with; which is far better than to sew it on with silk thread, as, of course, the raveling matches the colour so exactly as to render the stitches imperceptible. The braid reserved for raveling should be cut into the usual length of needle-fulls; then ravelled, and put into long thread-papers.</p>
<p>Having drawn the pattern on a strip of stiff <ingredient>white paper,</ingredient> prick it all along, according to its form or outline, with large, close pin-holes. Then lay or baste it on the <ingredient>merino.</ingredient> Take some <ingredient>pounce,</ingredient> (<ingredient>gum-sandarac</ingredient> finely powdered and sifted,) and with your finger rub it along the pricked outline of the paper-pattern. On removing the <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> you will find that the pounce-powder, going through the pin-holes, will have traced the pattern in small dots on the merino. This will be a guide in sewing on the braid, which should be run on, with short, close stitches. A double row of braid, the inner or right-hand row a <emph rend="italic">much darker</emph> shade than the first, has a raised or relieved look, which is very pretty; particularly when the second row is of the same colour as the merino or ground, but of an infinitely darker shade.</p>
<p>If you cannot match the merino with a braid exactly similar, select, always, one of a darker rather than a lighter shade. A light-coloured merino looks very well with a braiding of the same colour, but of a shade <emph rend="italic">considerably</emph> darker. Gray, fawn-colour, or scarlet merino appears to advantage braided with black; so, also, does light blue or pale lilac. Salmon-colour looks well with

<p><purpose>DIRECTIONS FOR EMBROIDERING MERINO.</purpose>--Merino dresses are usually worked in small sprigs, representing a little flower or bud, with two or three green leaves. Blue, lilac, or purple flowers have generally a more tasteful effect for this purpose than red or yellow ones. They will be sufficiently brightened by a shaded yellow spot in the centre. A beautiful sprig may be formed entirely of leaves, some of them comprising different tints of green, and others of brown. Three green leaves, with two brown ones at the bottom of the sprig, look exceedingly well on a gray merino; also, on a scarlet, crimson, or cherry-coloured ground. Mourning-gray should have black sprigs only. Gold-coloured flowers, if properly shaded, look well on purple, dark brown, or 
 
<pb n="333" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=339"/>

dark slate-coloured merino; but blue or lilac will look better still. Blue and brown harmonize well; also very light blue and very dark purple. Pink flowers look best on a dark olive ground. Blue and red should never come together in a dress. The effect of all sprigs, spots, or stars will be greatly improved by working, on the <emph rend="italic">right hand</emph> of each, a shadow of a colour similar to the <ingredient>merino,</ingredient> but of a <emph rend="italic">much darker</emph> shade. This dark shade along the right-hand side will give the sprig a relieved or raised appearance; and, if well done, will make it look almost as if you could take it up with your fingers. Executed by a skilful embroidress, or by one who is a proficient in drawing, this mode of producing a shadow, that seems to come from behind the sprig, will be found extremely beautiful. We are surprised that is not more generally known and practised.</p>
<p>Previous to working a dress, it is well to have the breadths of the skirts measured, and cut apart. The remainder, of course, is to be reserved for the body, sleeves, and pelerine; but do not have these parts fitted and cut out before embroidering. Though by that means you may save the trouble of doing a few unnecessary sprigs, you will lose more than you will gain; for the pieces, if cut out, will stretch out of shape, and ravel at the edges, so that it will be very difficult to put them <emph rend="italic">well</emph> together when wanted. Also, if previously cut out into their respective shapes, the pieces cannot well be worked in a frame, which is always the best way of doing embroidery.</p>
<p>You may work the dress with either <ingredient>soft-twisted silk,</ingredient> (not too fine,) or with <ingredient>Berlin wool</ingredient> or <ingredient>crewel.</ingredient> If worked with silk, it cannot possibly be washed to look well. <emph rend="italic">Floss</emph> silk should never be used for this or any other embroidery, as, though it fills up well, and looks beautifully at first, it almost immediately wears rough and fuzzy. Embroidery-stitch is far more elegant than cross-stitch, 
 
<pb n="334" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=340"/>

having none of its stiffness, hardness, and ungracefulness; and being, besides, more easy, expeditious, and manageable; and capable of a far greater diversity of forms.</p>
<p>Prepare on a <implement>pasteboard</implement> drawing-card, an exact pattern of the sprig, drawn and coloured precisely as it is to be worked; and you may put a dark back-ground behind one side of the sprig, of exactly the same tint as the merino. Mark the distances of the sprigs by measuring their places on the merino with a pair of compasses, (often called dividers,) or by means of a piece of card. Designate the place of each sprig by a dot with a red or white <implement>chalk pencil;</implement> the dot being the centre of the sprig. Rub, on a saucer, some <ingredient>water-colour paint</ingredient> of any colour that will show plainly on the merino, (which should first be stretched in a frame.) If you cannot get a frame, or prefer working on your hand, baste, under the place occupied by each sprig, a small circular bit of stiff <ingredient>writing-paper;</ingredient> and be careful, while working, not to catch up the <ingredient>paper</ingredient> with the stitches of your needle. When done, remove the <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> and the sprigs will look smooth and even. If you attempt to work it merely on your hand, with no <ingredient>paper</ingredient> beneath, it is impossible to prevent its puckering and drawing up.</p>
<p>Fine embroidery must be worked with extremely close stitches in rows or ridges. Every other stitch should be short, and every other one long. In every row, the alternate long and short stitches should fit in, by extending a little beyond those of the neighbouring row, so as to blend well. If you have no knowledge of drawing, get your pattern-sprig done by some person that draws well, and that is familiar with the effect of lights and shades.</p>
<p>If your dress is to have a belt of the same, you may work a long strip of merino for that purpose; the pattern being so arranged that the flowers will form a close row 
 
<pb n="335" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=341"/>

or straight wreath. Allow this strip of merino full wide, so that there may be an ample sufficiency for turning in at the edges. Sleeve-bands, also, may be worked in this way.</p>
<p>A two-yard-square of merino, embroidered in coloured flowers, and trimmed with a deep fringe, makes a beautiful shawl. On a dark brown or purple merino, flowers entirely of shaded blue, with light brown leaves and stalks interspersed among the green ones, will have a beautiful effect; very superior to the common tasteless and gaudy calico-style of introducing flowers of all colours--red, blue, and yellow. An olive merino shawl may have pink flowers entirely; a slate, or dark gray, or a purple will look well with rich gold-coloured flowers. In all flower-borders, the introduction of brown leaves among the green will be a decided improvement. If the merino is <emph rend="italic">light</emph> brown, or light gray, or <emph rend="italic">pale</emph> olive, the flowers may be scarlet, cherry-colour, or crimson. For a black merino, the embroidery should be of shaded gray.</p>
<p>Keep beside you, while working, a number of needles threaded with all the different shades of <ingredient>silk,</ingredient> and stuck in a flat pin-cushion, or something similar, so as to be always ready for use.</p>

<p><purpose>DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING A TABOURET.</purpose>--A tabouret is a square stool, tall enough for a grown person to sit on, and about the usual height of a chair.

Instead of having the <ingredient>lid</ingredient> or <ingredient>cover-piece</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">exactly</emph> at the top, it should be placed below it, four or five inches down the inside, so as to leave a vacant space between itself and the upper edges of the box; to the sides of which it must be well secured, either with <ingredient>glue,</ingredient> or with small headless <ingredient>tack-nails.</ingredient> The wooden bottom of the box must be placed two or three inches up, so as to leave a space at each end of the lower corners for concealed <implement>castors,</implement> that will cause the tabouret to be moved easily on the carpet.</p>
<p>The carpenter's part of the work being thus accomplished, the remainder of the tabouret can be easily completed by the ladies of the family, and at far less cost than if done by an upholsterer. We have seen beautiful tabourets made in this manner, and looking as if made entirely at a shop.</p>
<p>Get about seven or eight yards of strong, broad, very stout <ingredient>webbing,</ingredient> such as is used by saddlers or trunk-makers. You may either procure it of <emph rend="italic">them,</emph> or at one of the large fringe stores.

Afterwards, cover this cushion with <ingredient>damask,</ingredient> <ingredient>cloth,</ingredient> <ingredient>velvet,</ingredient> or some other handsome and durable article, and bind the edges all round. Next cover the four sides of the exterior of the box with the same material as the outside covering of the cushion; stretching it on very tightly and smoothly, and securing it to the wood with small tack-nails. While one person is driving in the nails, another must hold the box fast, and stretch and smooth the covering. When this has been neatly accomplished, nail on the cushion to the top edge of the box, above the webbing; hammering the tacks into the binding. Finish by tacking a handsome <ingredient>fringe</ingredient> all round the cushion, so as to conceal the binding. If you cannot get a fringe <emph rend="italic">exactly</emph> the colour of the outside cover, choose one that is a good contrast,--either much darker or much lighter. A light blue tabouret may have purple, brown, black, or deep orange-coloured fringe. One of crimson or scarlet may have a fringe of black, dark green, or gold-colour. For a green tabouret, the fringe may be black, purple, or lilac. A brown or purple tabouret may have a light blue or gold-coloured fringe. A gray one may be fringed with dark brown, dark green, or purple. Light blue may be fringed with a very dark blue; light green with a very dark green; pink with crimson; light brown with a very dark brown; and bright scarlet with <emph rend="italic">very deep</emph> crimson.

<p>THE SUMMER HEARTH.--Summer <implement>blowers,</implement> of handsomely ornamented iron, are now much used to conceal the empty coal-grates, during the season of warm weather. Like chimney-boards, they render the room very close, by entirely excluding the fresh air that may enter from the chimney. Certainly, in a bed-chamber, it is best that the fire-place should always be left entirely open. A frame made to fit in exactly, and having open slats, like a venetian door, is a good screen for a summer-hearth. These screens are best when divided down the middle, like a pair of venetian shutters; one or both of which may be left open at night, if in a sleeping room. To sleep in a room from whence all external air is entirely excluded, cannot be otherwise than prejudicial to health; and rarely fails, sooner or later, to undermine the constitution. Many people accustom themselves to sleep with the window-sash farthest from the bed a little open all the year round, (except when the rain or snow comes in that direction;) and in consequence of having acquired this salutary habit, these persons rarely take cold from any exposure to a draught of air. On this subject, the author can adduce the evidence of her personal experience.</p>
<p>Another good chimney-screen is a maple or walnut-wood frame, filled up with open wire-work, painted green like a wire <implement>fender,</implement> and fitting exactly into the fire-place. 
 
<pb n="342" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=348"/>

These frames should have two brass knobs near the top, for lifting them in and out. Chimney-boards, of course, can only be put into open fire-places, where wood is burnt in cold weather. On the hearth of a vacant <implement>Franklin stove</implement> it is usual to keep a large jar of flowers, which should be renewed every day or two.</p>
<p>Where there is no <implement>summer-blower,</implement> it is usual to decorate the empty grate with cut paper. This may be done in a very pretty manner by obtaining a sufficient quantity of coloured, glossy writing-paper, of such tints as will harmonize best with each other. For instance, green and lilac; green and light pink; light blue and dark brown; blue and buff, or cream-colour; purple and yellow; two shades of green--one very dark, the other very light; or two shades of blue--one much lighter than the other. Cut this paper, lengthways, into long, straight strips; in breadth, about three or four inches. Fold these slips lengthways, and evenly; and, while doubled, cut their edges with sharp scissors into a fringe. Then wreathe these double fringes thickly and closely round the bars of the grate, securing them with pins. On each bar there should be two wreaths, each of a different colour or shade. Twist or wrap these two wreaths together, so as to conceal the iron entirely; beginning the first twist or fringe from the left hand, and crossing or entwining it with one of another shade or colour commencing from the right. If well arranged, this mode of decorating an empty grate has an excellent effect. The bars should previously be well cleaned, and the back and whole interior of the grate completely blacked. Tissue-paper is too soft and thin for wreathing the bars of grates. Coloured writing-paper will be found much better; or, indeed, any nice paper that is thick and smooth, and of the same colour on both sides.</p>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>TISSUE-PAPER HEARTH CURTAINS.</purpose>--There is an infinite variety of patterns for <ingredient>tissue-paper</ingredient> drapery to conceal empty coal-grates. The most simple is to take a sufficient number of long sheets of this <ingredient>paper;</ingredient> fold each sheet, lengthways, in four or six; and with scissors cut through the edges of the folds, so as to form scollops or points when opened out; leaving at the bottom of each sheet a space to be cut into a deep fringe. Having opened out the sheets, have ready <ingredient>part of the handle or stick of an old broom,</ingredient> cut to fit the length of the aperture or slit left open at the back of the grate for the draught. This stick must be covered with <implement>baize</implement> or <ingredient>cloth</ingredient> sewed on tightly. Sew to this covering the long streamers of cut <ingredient>tissue-paper,</ingredient> gathering them at the top so that they may hang down full and double. Then lay the stick nicely in the aperture at the top of the grate-back; fasten it securely, and let the drapery fall over the outside of the bars, so as to conceal them.</p>
<p>The following is a very handsome way of arranging hearth curtains. Have ready a sufficient number of long sheets of <ingredient>tissue-paper.</ingredient> Some of them may be white, others of a delicate pink. They are to be cut out in a handsome open-work pattern. You may take your pattern from muslin-work, flowered ribbon, furniture chintz, wall-paper, or table-covers. The more open it is the better. To render it accurate, first draw the outline on <ingredient>stiff paper,</ingredient> and then cut out that <ingredient>paper</ingredient> accordingly. Lay this cut out model upon a sheet of the <ingredient>pink tissue-paper</ingredient> spread out on a smooth common table, and kept down by weights at each corner. With a pencil, go round the model, and trace its outline upon the <ingredient>tissue-paper.</ingredient> Then with a sharp <implement>penknife</implement> or scissors, cut it out with great care and nicety. If you use a <implement>penknife,</implement> keep the <ingredient>tissue-paper</ingredient> stretched out smoothly upon the table, all the time you are doing it.</p>
 
<pb n="344" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=350"/>

<p>Next, take two more sheets of the <ingredient>pink paper,</ingredient> and cut the upper part of each sheet into the form of curtain-falls; festooned at the top, and descending long and low at the side. Ornament them with a handsome cut pattern, and scollop the edges.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>white tissue-paper</ingredient> is not to be cut or decorated with an open pattern or flowering. It is to form a lining for the pink, through the open work of which the white is to appear. The form or arrangement of this <ingredient>white paper</ingredient> is to fit or correspond with that of the pink, only that the white must be allowed two or three inches deeper at the edge, that it may project out beyond the pink. These projecting white edges are to be cut into a fringe. Additional fringe must be made of <ingredient>white tissue-paper,</ingredient> and twisted together so as to represent cords; the cords to be finished with tassels made of rolls of <ingredient>white paper fringe,</ingredient> fastened to the cords very neatly by sewing them on with a needle and <ingredient>thread.</ingredient> Observe that none of the <emph rend="italic">white</emph> paper is to be cut out in flower patterns, or any sort of open work. It is only to furnish lining, fringe, cords, and tassels for the pink. Observe, also, that the fringed edge of this white lining is to appear beyond the scolloped edge of the pink outside.</p>
<p>When all is ready, arrange it handsomely in the fire-place, so as entirely to conceal the whole of the grate. It must be fixed at the top by sewing it to a <ingredient>covered piece of broom-handle,</ingredient> made to fit the draught aperture. The two long straight pieces of <ingredient>pink paper,</ingredient> with their white lining underneath, are to go on first. Then put up the <ingredient>festoons</ingredient> with their falls, having their white lining beneath, with its fringe appearing beyond the pink scollops. Then put on, at proper distances, the <ingredient>white cords</ingredient> and <ingredient>tassels.</ingredient> The effect, when complete, will represent at the back, closed pink curtains, with their white lining appearing through the cut-out flower pattern; over them, 
 
<pb n="345" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=351"/>

two festoons and falls of pink lined with white, opening in front with their white fringe, and white cords and tassels. In these festoons and falls, the cut-out flowers of the <ingredient>pink paper</ingredient> outside, show the <ingredient>white paper</ingredient> lining beneath. If well executed, these hearth curtains will (as we have seen) have a most beautiful effect. The pattern or flowering of the cut work is displayed to great advantage by the white lining. In one parlour you may have hearth curtains of pink and white; in the other of green and white, or blue and white.</p>
<p>Hearth curtains of <ingredient>tissue-paper</ingredient> may be fixed to the front ledge or slab that goes along the top of the grate, provided this ledge is wide enough. Leave, uncut, at the top of the sheets of <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> a plain piece to fit the ledge. To keep down this <ingredient>paper</ingredient> upon the ledge, prepare three heavy weights (for instance <ingredient>smooth stones</ingredient>) covered with thick <ingredient>silk</ingredient> or <ingredient>satin,</ingredient> and decorated with large bows of <ingredient>ribbon</ingredient> of the same colour. In this way, by keeping it down with weights on the top, we have seen a very handsome drapery of cut out <ingredient>tissue-paper</ingredient> entirely concealing a <implement>Franklin stove.</implement></p>

<p><purpose>MARKING THE KEYS OF A PIANO.</purpose>--Beginners on the piano (children especially) sometimes find much difficulty in learning the affinity between the keys and the notes. After acquiring the gamut theoretically, it is frequently a long time before they can apply it practically to the keys of the instrument, so as at once to find the right key on looking at the corresponding note. The process may be much accelerated (and indeed made perfectly easy) by some grown person marking on the keys the letters that designate the notes. By the following simple method this can be done without any injury or defacement of the ivory. Take a sheet of thick smooth <ingredient>writing-paper,</ingredient> and cut out of it as many little square 
 
<pb n="346" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=352"/>

pieces as there are white keys on the piano. Paste these <ingredient>papers</ingredient> on the ivory; and when <emph rend="italic">perfectly</emph> dry, mark on each with <ingredient>common <emph rend="italic">blue</emph> ink</ingredient> the letter belonging to that key. It will be best to do this in Roman capitals. If the natural keys are thus distinctly designated, the learner will find little difficulty from the flats and sharps, or black keys, being left unmarked.</p>
<p>The learner will thus in a very short time become familiar with the correspondence of the keys of the piano and the notes in the music book; and will soon be at no loss in finding them. It is well, however, not to remove the marks in less than a month or two. Then loosen the <ingredient>papers</ingredient> by wetting them with a little <ingredient>water;</ingredient> take them off, and wipe the keys first with a wet and then with a dry cloth. Blue ink of the common sort will leave no trace upon the ivory; but good black ink might probably leave a slight stain, unless the <ingredient>paper</ingredient> was very thick. Therefore do not use it.</p>
<p>The learner having thus become thoroughly acquainted with the keys while they were lettered, will not find the least difficulty in remembering them after the marks are taken off.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose>TO USE A PAPER-KNIFE.</purpose>--In using a <implement>paper-knife</implement> to cut open the leaves of a new book, keep your left hand firmly pressed down upon the open page, while you hold the knife in your right. This will prevent the edges of the leaves from cutting rough and jagged. Cut open the tops of the leaves before you run the knife up the side-edges, and cut with a short, quick, hard stroke. The most serviceable <implement>paper-knives</implement> are of ivory, and without a handle; the handles being very apt to break.</p>

slip of fine smooth paper, write your name upon that, and paste it on nicely. If you put your name on one of the fly-leaves, it may be torn out; and if written on the corner of the title-page, that corner may be snipped off, should the book fall into the hands of a dishonest person.</p>

<p>HOUSEHOLD TOOLS.--Much inconvenience and considerable expense would be saved, if it was the universal custom to keep in every house a few tools, for the purpose of performing at home what are called small jobs; instead of being always obliged to send for a mechanic, and pay him for executing little things that might be very well done by a man or boy belonging to the family; provided that the proper instruments were at hand. The cost of these articles is very trifling, and the advantages of having them always in the house (particularly in the country) are beyond all price. In a small private family it may not be necessary to keep more than a few of these things; but that few are almost indispensable to comfort. For instance, there should be an axe, a saw, a claw-hammer, a mallet, a screw-driver, a <implement>bed-screw,</implement> a <implement>gimlet,</implement> one or two <implement>jack-knives,</implement> a pair of large scissors or shears, and a <implement>trowel.</implement> If there were two <implement>gimlets,</implement> and two screw-drivers, (large and small,) it would be better still. Likewise, an assortment of hooks, and of nails of different sizes, from large spikes down to small tacks; not forgetting a supply of brass-headed nails, some large and some small. Screws, also, will be found very convenient. The nails and screws should be kept in a wooden box, with divisions or partitions to separate the various sorts; for it is very troublesome to select them when all mixed together.</p>
<p>No house should be without glue, chalk, putty, paint, cord, twine, and wrapping-paper of different sorts. And 
 
<pb n="348" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=354"/>

care should be taken that the supply is not suffered to run out, lest the deficiency might cause delay and inconvenience at a time when most wanted.</p>
<p>It is well to have, in the lower part of the house, a deep closet appropriated entirely to tools and things of equal utility, for performing at once such little repairs as convenience may require, without the delay or expense of sending for an artisan. This closet may have one large, broad shelf; and that not more than three feet above the floor. Beneath the shelf may be a deep drawer, divided in two. This drawer may contain cakes of glue; pieces of chalk; hanks of manilla-grass cord; and balls of twine, of different size and thickness. At the sides of the closet may be small shelves for glue-pots, paste-pots, and brushes; pots for black, white, green, and red paint; cans of painting-oil, &#38;c. On the wall above the large shelf, let the tools be suspended, or laid across nails or hooks of proper size to support them. This is much better than to keep them all in a box, where they may be injured by rubbing against each other, and the hand may be hurt by feeling among them to find the one that is wanted. When hung up against the closet-wall, each tool may be seen at a glance. We have been shown an excellent and simple contrivance for designating the exact places of these things. On the wall, directly under the nails that support the tools, is drawn, with a small brush dipped in black paint or ink, an outline representation of the tool or instrument appropriated to that particular place. For instance, under each saw is sketched the outline of the saw; under each <implement>gimlet</implement> is a sketch of the <implement>gimlet;</implement> under the screw-drivers are slight drawings of the screw-drivers. So that when any tool is brought back after being taken away for use, the exact spot to which it belongs may be seen in a moment by its representation on the wall; and all confusion in putting them up, or finding 
 
<pb n="349" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=355"/>

them again, is thus prevented. We highly recommend this plan.</p>
<p>Wrapping-paper may be piled on the floor beneath the large shelf. It can be bought very low, by the ream, at the wholesale paper stores; and every house should be supplied with it in several varieties. For instance, coarse brown paper for common things. That denominated ironmongers' paper, being strong, thick, and in large sheets, is useful for enclosing heavy articles. Nankeen-paper is best for putting up nice parcels, such as books, or things of fine quality that are to be sent to a distance. What is called shoe-paper (each ream generally containing a variety of colours, red, blue, buff, &#38;c.) is also very useful for wrapping small articles, as, though soft, it is not brittle. This paper is very cheap, the usual price seldom exceeding 56 cents per ream, (twenty quires.)</p>
<p>Old waste newspapers are unfit for wrapping any articles that can be soiled by the printing-ink rubbing off upon them. But they may be used for packing china, glass, brass, tin, &#38;c. Also for lighting fires, singeing poultry, and cleaning mirrors or windows. Waste written-paper is of little use, except for allumettes or lamp-lighters. It is well to keep a large jar or bag to receive scraps of waste paper, as it sells for a cent a pound, and these cents may be given to poor children.</p>
<p>We have seen persons, when preparing for a journey, or putting up things to send away, "at their wits' end" for want of a sheet of good wrapping-paper; a string of twine; a few nails; or a little paint to mark a box. We have seen a door standing ajar during a whole week, (and in cold weather too,) for want of a screw-driver to fix a disordered lock, the locksmith not coming when he was sent for.</p>
<p>It seems scarcely credible that any respectable house should be without a hammer; yet we have known genteel 
 
<pb n="350" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=356"/>

families, whose sole dependence for that indispensable article was on borrowing it of their neighbours. And when the hammer was obtained, there were, perhaps, no nails in the house; at least none of the requisite size.</p>
<p>The attention of boys should be early directed to the use of common tools. And if there were tools at hand, there are few American boys that would not take pleasure in learning to use them. By seeing carpenters, locksmiths, bell-hangers, &#38;c., at work, they may soon learn to be passably expert in those arts; and a smart and observant boy will soon acquire considerable amateur proficiency in them. Many useful jobs can be done by servant-men, if there are proper tools in the house.</p>

<section class1="etiquette">
<p>LETTERS.--For letter-writing, always use good paper; it should be fine, smooth, white, and sufficiently thick not to let the writing show through on the other side. Very good letter-paper can seldom be purchased at less than twenty-five cents per quire. That which is lower in price is inferior in quality. If you cannot trust yourself to write straightly without some guide, have printed ruled lines to slip beneath the page; for a letter does not look well if written on paper that is already ruled with pale blue ink. If you write a small hand, your lines should be closer together than if your writing is large. It is well to have several sorts of ruled lines; they are to be bought at any stationer's for a few cents a page.</p>
<p>If you are writing to a relative, or to an intimate friend, and have much to say, and expect to fill the sheet, begin near the top of the first page. But if your letter is to be a short one, commence lower down, several inches from the top. If a <emph rend="italic">very</emph> short letter, of only a few lines, begin but a little above the middle of the page.</p>
 
<pb n="351" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=357"/>

<p>Write the date near the right-hand side, and place it about a line higher than the two or three words of greeting or accosting with which letters usually commence. Begin the first sentence a little below these words, and farther towards the right than the lines that are to follow it. It is well, in dating <emph rend="italic">every</emph> letter, to give always your exact residence,--not only the town, but the street also, and the number of your house. If your correspondent has had but one notification of your present place of abode, the number, and even the street may have been forgotten; the letter containing it may not be at hand as a reference; and the reply may, in consequence, be misdirected; or directed in so vague a manner that it may never reach you. We have known much trouble, inconvenience, and indeed loss, ensue from not specifying, in the date of <emph rend="italic">each</emph> letter, the exact dwelling-place of the writer. But if it is always designated at the top of <emph rend="italic">every one,</emph> a reference to any of your letters will furnish the proper address. It is customary to date letters at the top, and notes at the bottom. If your letter is so long as to fill more than one sheet, number the pages.</p>
<p>As important words are frequently lost by being torn off with the seal in opening a letter, leave always, in the third or last page, two blank spaces where the seal is to come. These spaces should be left rather too large than too small. You can write in short lines between them. If you cannot otherwise ascertain where the sealing is likely to be, fold your sheet into the form of a letter before you begin to write it; and then, with the point of a pin, (or something similar,) trace, as faintly as possible, two circles, one on the turn-over, the other on the corresponding part of the paper that comes beneath it. These faint circles, when you are writing the last page, will show you where the seal is to go, and what space you are to leave for it. In opening a letter, it is best to 
 
<pb n="352" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=358"/>

cut round the seal; rather than to break it, and <emph rend="italic">tear</emph> the letter open.</p>
<p>In folding a letter let the breadth (from right to left) far exceed the height. A letter the least verging towards squareness looks very awkward. It is well to use a folding-stick (or ivory <implement>paper-knife</implement>) to press along the edges of the folds, and make them smooth and even. Take care in folding a letter to make <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the creases <emph rend="italic">exactly straight</emph> and even. If one is looser than another, or if there is the slightest widening out or narrowing in towards the edge of the turn-over, the letter will have a crooked, unsightly appearance. You may direct it before sealing; slipping your ruled paper under the back of the letter, that you may run no risk of writing the direction crooked. Begin the address rather nearer to the bottom than the top of the folded letter. Write the name of the person to whom you send it about the middle, and very clearly and distinctly. Then give the number and street on the next line a little nearer to the right. Then the town in <emph rend="italic">large</emph> letters, and extending almost close to the extreme right. Just under the town, add the abbreviation of the name of the state--as, Pa. for Pennsylvania, N. Y. for New York. But if the letter is to go to New York <emph rend="italic">city,</emph> put the words New York in full, written large. Much confusion is caused by this state and its metropolis having both the same name. It has been well suggested that the name of the state might be changed to Ontario--a beautiful change.</p>
<p>If the letter is to go to a provincial town, put the name of the county in which that town is situated, immediately over the designation of the state. We believe that throughout the union there are more than fifty towns called Washington. If your letter is for the <emph rend="italic">city</emph> of Washington, direct for Washington, D. C.--these initials implying the District of Columbia.</p>
 
<pb n="353" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=359"/>

<p>Another reason for the propriety of designating the state is, that many of our towns are called after places in Europe: and it has chanced (though not very often) that letters not explicitly and fully directed, have found their way into the mail-bags of packet vessels, and been carried across the Atlantic. We know an instance of a gentleman who directed an important letter simply to Boston, without any indication of the state of <alt synonym1="Massachusetts;">Massachusets;</alt> and the letter went from Philadelphia to the small town of Boston in Lincolnshire, England. In writing <emph rend="italic">from</emph> Europe, it is well always to finish the direction with the words United States of North America.</p>
<p>If you send the letter by a private opportunity, it will be sufficient to introduce close to the lower edge of the left-hand corner on the back, simply the name of the gentleman who takes it, written small. It is now considered old fashioned to insert on the back of such a letter, "Politeness of Mr. Smith," "Favoured by Mr. Jones," "Honoured by Mr. Brown." If to cross the sea, write the name of the vessel on the left hand corner of the outside.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake in a word, it will be better to draw your pen through the error, so as to render it entirely illegible, and then interline the correction, rather than attempt scratching out the mistake with a <implement>penknife,</implement> and afterwards trying to write another word in the identical place; a thing that is rarely, if ever, done well.</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, nearly on a line with your signature, (which should be close to the right side,) it is usual to put, near the extremity of the <emph rend="italic">left</emph> side of the page, the name of the person to whom the letter is addressed. Write your signature rather larger than your usual hand; and put a dot or period after your name.</p>
<p>In writing a ceremonious and very respectful note, or in addressing a person with whom you are not very 
 
<pb n="354" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=360"/>

intimate, enclose it in an envelope, and put the direction <emph rend="italic">on the cover only.</emph> It is now customary always to enclose in envelopes invitations to parties; visiting cards sent to strangers; cards left previous to a marriage; and farewell cards on leaving the place. On the latter it is usual to put the initials <emph rend="italic">t. t. l.</emph> (to take leave,) or <emph rend="italic">p. p. c.</emph> (<emph rend="italic">pour prendre cong&#233;,</emph> which has the same signification.) We have also seen <emph rend="italic">p. d. a.</emph> (<emph rend="italic">pour dire adieu,</emph> to bid adieu.) For a note, always use a very small seal. There are varieties of beautiful little wafers for notes; also of beautiful note-paper. It is not necessary in addressing an intimate friend to follow, particularly, any of these conventional observances.</p>
<p>For sealing letters no light is so convenient as a <implement>wax taper.</implement> A lamp or candle may smoke and blacken the wax. To seal well, your wax should be of the finest quality. Good red wax is generally the best, and its colour should be of a brilliant scarlet. Inferior red wax consumes very fast; and always, when melted, looks purplish or brownish. When going to melt sealing-wax, rest your elbow on the table to keep your hand steady. Take the stick of wax between your thumb and finger, and hold it a little above the light, so that it barely touches the point of the flame. Then insert a little of the melted wax <emph rend="italic">under</emph> the turn-over part of the letter, just where the seal is to come. This will make it more secure than if the sole dependence was on the outside seal. Or instead of this little touch of wax, you may slip under the turnover a small wafer, either white or of the same colour as the wax. Take the stick of wax, hold it over the flame just so as to touch the tip; next turn it round till the end of the stick is equally softened on every side. Then apply it to your letter, beginning on the outer edge of the place you intend for the seal; and moving the wax round in a circle, which must gradually diminish till it 
 
<pb n="355" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=361"/>

terminates in the centre. Put the seal exactly into the middle of the soft wax, and press  it down hard, but do not screw it round. Then withdraw it suddenly. Do not use motto seals unless writing to a member of your own family, or to an intimate friend. For common use, (and particularly for letters of business, or in addressing strangers,) a plain seal with the initials of your name will be best.</p>
<p>We subjoin the usual abbreviations of the states, &#38;c.:--</p>
<p>Maine, <emph rend="italic">Me.</emph> New Hampshire, <emph rend="italic">N. H.</emph> Vermont, <emph rend="italic">Vt.</emph> Massachusetts, <emph rend="italic">Mass.</emph> Rhode Island, <emph rend="italic">R.

<p>The name of the town to which the letter is to go, should always be superscribed in full. If a country town or village, it will be necessary to designate the county in which it is situated, as there are so many provincial towns of the same name. Finish with the designation of the state under the whole, close to the right-hand corner.</p>
<p>In directing to a clergyman, put <emph rend="italic">Rev.</emph> (Reverend) before his name. To an officer, immediately after his name, and on the same line with it, put <emph rend="italic">U. S.

member of Congress, precede his name with <emph rend="italic">Hon.</emph> (Honourable.)</p>
<p>In putting up packets to send away, either tie them round and across with red tape (sealing them also) or seal them without tying. Twine or cord may cut through the paper, and is better omitted. Never put up any thing in newspaper. Beside the danger of soiling the articles inside, it looks mean and disrespectful. Keep yourself provided with different sorts of wrapping-paper. A large parcel should have more than one seal, and the seal may be rather larger than for a letter.</p>

<section class1="generalnonfood">
<p>CROSSING THE SEA.--The most usual voyage made by American ladies is across the Atlantic; and the time chosen for that voyage is generally in the spring or autumn. A winter passage is seldom attempted by ladies; and few that have tried it once are willing to undertake it a second time. To those who are preparing to traverse the ocean that separates us from Europe, we hope the following hints may not be unacceptable.</p>
<p>We earnestly recommend that every lady who can afford to pay the additional price, should engage, at an early period, a state-room exclusively to herself; unless, indeed, she can share it with a near relation. She will find the money well spent in securing the privacy and comfort of an apartment into which no one has a right to intrude; besides the additional space she will thus obtain for such articles as she would like to have with her in her room. No one who has not been at sea can imagine the perpetual and mutual annoyance of being confined to the small limits of a state-room with a stranger; each incommoding the other all the time, and each feeling herself under the continual <emph rend="italic">surveillance</emph> of her companion; both expected to make incessant sacrifices to the convenience 
 
<pb n="357" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=363"/>

of each other, and perhaps only one of them having a disposition to submit to these sacrifices; in which case she that is the most amiable is always the sufferer. We believe it to be the rule in packet-ships that the first applicant for a passage is allowed the privilege of being the last to have a stranger put into her apartment. And if the passengers are not numerous, the fortunate first applicant may in this manner have a whole state-room without the extra charge. But by offering this additional price on taking her passage, she can <emph rend="italic">always</emph> secure the exclusive possession of an entire state-room.</p>
<p>If you have an apartment exclusively to yourself, the place of the second bed can be filled with boxes, books, &#38;c., for which you would not otherwise have room. But as no ship state-room is large enough to contain <emph rend="italic">much</emph> baggage, you should make your arrangements to wear during the voyage such articles of outside dress as will least require washing. Therefore, let all light-coloured or white dresses be packed away in the trunks that are to remain below, and not to be opened till the close of the voyage.</p>
<p>As ladies can have no washing done at sea, it will be well to begin with such dresses as can be worn all the passage. French silks are not good sea dresses, (even when black,) for the salt-air shrivels, spots, and turns them rusty. Dark-coloured india silks, or dark mousselines de laine, or merinoes, are much better. Dark chintzes, with no white in the figure, are convenient for common wear, at sea as well as on shore.</p>
<p>Muslin or bobbinet collars, to be worn in the ever-damp sea-air, should have no other trimming than an edging sewed on plain; as quilled or pleated frills lose their stiffening immediately. Silk neck-kerchiefs, or little shawls for the neck, will be found very convenient as substitutes for collars; and, if of white silk, they are extremely 
 
<pb n="358" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=364"/>

becoming. Or you may wear a broad, thick white ribbon, shaped with three diminishing pleats, to fit in closely the back of the neck, and crossed in front. Quilled or fluted cap-borders soon become limp and formless with the damp; so also do gauze or <emph rend="italic">glac&#233;</emph> ribbons. Sea-caps should have borders either simply gathered or laid on plain; and their ribbons should be mantua, lutestring, or soft satin. A cap lined all through with silk of a pretty colour, will be very convenient at sea, as it not only assists in keeping the damp air from the head, but conceals the hair effectually; and there are rough days when the motion of the ship renders it impossible to arrange the hair nicely. A silk or madras handkerchief, pinned up into a sort of small turban, is sometimes worn at sea, instead of caps. They are very convenient, but only becoming to pretty ladies.</p>
<p>It is colder at sea than on shore; and even in summer, the atmosphere of the Atlantic is liable to be chilled for several days by the vicinity of floating icebergs,--even when these icebergs are not seen. Therefore, be careful at any season, to have in your state-room a sufficiency of warm clothing. A spring-passage is generally colder than an autumn one; and even in May it is sometimes found necessary, when on the open ocean, to dress as if it were winter. <implement>Flannel,</implement> of course, is indispensable; so, also, is a large thick woollen shawl, and a second shawl of lighter texture for mild weather. A very convenient outside sea-dress is the garment or coat that is sometimes called a mandarine. It should be made of very dark India silk, which is soft, strong, and not liable to stain or spot like the silks of Europe. This dress should be very long and wide; wadded and lined all through; and made with large, loose sleeves, large sleeve-holes, and a wrapper-body, confined at the waist by a broad ribbon run into a casing, and tied in front. A mandarine can be 
 
<pb n="359" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=365"/>

put on over another dress without rumpling it; and is far better than a cloak, as it is warmer and more compact, sits closer, and is not so liable to be blown about by the wind. At sea, there are always days when a mandarine will be found very comfortable to wear, even in the cabin.</p>
<p>No dress intended to be worn on a voyage should fasten <emph rend="italic">behind,</emph> as it is not always that a lady can procure the assistance of another person to do this for her. Gowns, (or coat-dresses, as they are frequently called,) such as fasten in front, are the best habits for sea; and there is now a well-known way of making wrappers that is both handsome and convenient, and universally becoming. Fortunately; corsets are now exploded; and as they are no longer worn on shore, of course no one would be so absurd as to endure them at sea. Jackets of <implement>flannel,</implement> lined silk, thick cotton, or jean, made without whalebones, and to fasten in front, are best suited to a voyage. A <implement>flannel</implement> gown and a dark double-wrapper are indispensable in case of sickness. Your upper petticoat should be of dark linen, worsted, or silk. If you have no mandarine, take with you, by all means, a wadded silk petticoat, and a pair of slightly-wadded silk inside-sleeves, to be tied in beneath your gown-sleeves in chilly weather. For this purpose, have four tapes sewed to the top of each sleeve, at equal distances, and four corresponding tapes sewed to the inside of each arm-hole of your gowns.</p>
<p>The best sea-stockings are those of substantial, <emph rend="italic">unbleached</emph> cotton. No others are so comfortable. Dark satin-ribbed cotton stockings are also good; so are the black raw silk, such as are shaggy inside. Take with you some <emph rend="italic">very thick</emph> gray yarn stockings, to put on when your feet are cold in bed, and to draw on, occasionally, over your shoes and other stockings. Gaiter-boots, and boots lined with fur, are very comfortable when once on; 
 
<pb n="360" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=366"/>

but at sea, there is often some trouble in lacing or buttoning them. Shoes worn on ship-board should be thin-soled and roomy, so that you may walk the deck easier, and keep your feet better when the vessel rolls. Shoes of wadded silk are very pleasant at sea; so are Indian moccasins, or carpet moccasins lined with wool. Take with you two or three pairs of woolly sheep-skin soles, such as are coated on the under side with india-<implement>rubber</implement> varnish. They are warm, dry, and water-proof; can be slipped into your shoes or taken out, as occasion may require; and either for sea or shore, are far superior to the cork soles also in use.</p>
<p>A sea-bonnet should have a deep, close front, and a cape or ruffle at the back of the neck. The complexion is always liable to be injured by the salt air, the glare of the sun, and the bleak wind. A quilted close bonnet of dark silk or satin, lined with pink, blue, or lemon-colour, may be made to look very pretty. Cane or whalebone being very apt to break in the wind, it is best to run wired-satin piping-cord into the cases of a sea-bonnet, and round the edge. This will stiffen it sufficiently; and being very elastic, will keep it in shape without danger of breaking. These bonnets should, by all means, have a large wadded cape attached to them. At sea, it is important to keep the back of the neck always covered, for its exposure to the air may produce rheumatic pains in the head, shoulders, and face. Even in the cabin, and at all times when on ship-board, (except in decidedly warm weather,) it is prudent to wear a handkerchief of silk, cashmere, or velvet, tied or pinned round the neck, with a corner covering it closely behind.</p>
<p>Provide yourself, also, with a pair or two of warm gloves. On days when fire is most needed, it is most difficult to have it in the cabin of a ship. If the wind is strong, it impedes the draught of the stove, and fills the 
 
<pb n="361" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=367"/>

cabin with the smoke that is beaten down the chimney. And if the vessel rolls much, (as she always will in rough weather,) there is danger of the fire falling about the floor; and to prevent accidents from this cause, it is deemed safest to extinguish it entirely, or else not to kindle it at all. The passengers must depend chiefly on their clothing for warmth enough to make them tolerably comfortable,--particularly if they cross the ocean early in the spring or late in the autumn. But, as we before observed, a spring-passage is always the coldest. In the autumn, there is no danger of meeting with icebergs. Also, the ocean-water still retains a portion of the warmth communicated to it by the summer sun; while, in the spring, it remains a long while chilled from the cold of the preceding winter.</p>
<p>As dressing on ship-board is always more or less troublesome and inconvenient, on account of the motion of the vessel, and must generally be done in a sitting posture, it is well to make one dressing suffice for the day.</p>
<p>When packing to go on board, select such articles as are indispensable for use during the voyage, and put them all into one trunk, which must not be too large to keep in your state-room. You will find drawers there, in which you can place your caps, collars, handkerchiefs, and other light articles. Have a strong linen clothes-bag, with a drawing-string at the top, to hang up on one of the pegs or hooks in your apartment. The remainder of your baggage must be put below, in the place appropriated to stowing away the trunks of the passengers, with the understanding that they are to remain there all the voyage.</p>
<p>However pleasant you may find it to stay on deck, it is best, as soon as you get on board, to go to your state-room, and make your arrangements there, lest you should be rendered incapable of doing so by the approach of sea- 
 
<pb n="362" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=368"/>

sickness; an event that may usually be expected within an hour after the vessel gets under-way, if she sails from New York or Boston, or any port in the vicinity of the ocean. Take out of your trunk your night-clothes, your easiest slippers, and whatever articles you may require for immediate use; and place them where they can be directly accessible.</p>
<p>Some few ladies, as well as gentlemen, cross the ocean without being in the least troubled with sea-sickness; and very many only suffer from it during the first two or three days, and are then perfectly well during the remainder of the passage, however stormy it may be. If you should incline to be sick, it will be nearly useless to struggle against it the first day or two. You may try as a preventive, or as an early remedy when the first symptoms come upon you, a lump of loaf-sugar placed in the bottom of a wine-glass, with just as much brandy poured on as will be sufficient to dissolve it, so that it can be eaten with a tea-spoon. If taken in time, this frequently succeeds; and it rarely fails in the short sickness that is sometimes felt in excursions down in the bay of New York; or in Boston harbour, when the water is rough; or in going round Point Judith; or in a trip by sea to any of the coast bathing-places.</p>
<p>If you find your sickness increasing, give up to it for a day or two; and you will afterwards feel much the better for it. For the first two days you need take no nourishment but chicken-water. Avoid lemonade, oranges, all other acids, and every sort of warm drink. Be careful, while you are sick, not to taste any thing that you may like to eat afterwards, as it will give you a disgust to it during the remainder of the voyage. For the same reason, it is well not to use cologne-water, or any very fine perfume during your sickness. Liquid camphor, sprinkled over the bed and floor, will be found 
 
<pb n="363" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=369"/>

more refreshing and purifying to the atmosphere than any thing else that you can take with you.</p>
<p>The third day (if not before) you ought to make every possible exertion to go on deck, as you will be losing strength by remaining in bed; and as long as you keep your head in a recumbent posture, you will not become accustomed to the motion of the vessel. Also, on the third day, endeavour to eat a small portion of solid, relishing food--such as a piece of broiled ham, or the lean of salt beef, with a slice of dry toast. We have known what is called the tone of the stomach restored after sea-sickness by a little of the sailors' salt beef and biscuit. Something of this sort is always more effective than light or delicate food.</p>
<p>It will be well before you embark, to provide yourself with a box of that excellent medicine known as Lady Webster's (or Lady Crespigny's) pills. They are called by both names; probably because both these ladies patronized them in England. You may take one every night <emph rend="italic">immediately after</emph> supper. In Philadelphia they are made according to the best recipe by J. C. Turnpenny, druggist, corner of Spruce and Tenth streets.</p>
<p>You may find a clay-ball for the removal of grease spots very useful to keep in your room; as, when the ship is rolling, greasy substances are frequently spilt on dresses.</p>
<p>Take with you and keep always in your apartment, a life-preserver, in case of being wrecked in sight of land; and it may really save your life by buoying you up, and floating you to the shore. It is said that a man's hat, laid brim downwards, and tied up in a shawl or pocket-handkerchief, and then fastened round the waist, will keep a person above water long enough to prevent drowning, if not far from the beach. The ladies of New York and Boston, and of other cities on the sea-board, 
 
<pb n="364" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=370"/>

have it in their power to learn, without danger or difficulty, the art of swimming; by subscribing to the salt-water baths, and visiting them daily during the summer.</p>
<p>Nothing will make a sea-voyage seem shorter or less monotonous, than to be well provided with occupation--such as amusing and interesting books, and a due portion of needle-work or knitting. By all means take with you one or more blank-books for the purpose of noting down whatever you may wish to remember. If you can keep a regular journal, so much the better. Also, the first day that you are able to write after getting to sea, commence on a <emph rend="italic">large</emph> sheet of paper, a letter to one of your relations or friends, having previously folded and directed it. Write but a few lines at first; and every day add a little more to it, giving the fresh dates. It will always be ready (requiring only a wafer to seal it) in case you should have an opportunity of sending it by any vessel you may chance to meet, on her way to the land you have left. If no such chance offers during the voyage, this diary-letter will at least be ready to transmit with those you write home directly after arriving at your destined post. And your friends will be glad to have this concise transcript of your sea-life.</p>

with butter and molasses. We subjoin a receipt for pumpkin mush, an excellent and wholesome breakfast dish.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p><purpose>PUMPKIN MUSH.</purpose>--Pour into a clean pot, two quarts or more of good <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and set it over the fire. Have ready some <ingredient>pumpkin</ingredient> stewed very soft and dry; mashed smooth, and pressed in a <implement>cullender</implement> till all the liquid has drained off. Then measure a large pint of the stewed <ingredient>pumpkin;</ingredient> mix with it a piece of fresh <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and a teaspoonful of ground <ingredient>ginger.</ingredient> Stir it gradually into the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> as soon as it has come to a boil. Add, by degrees, a large pint or more of <ingredient>indian-meal,</ingredient> a little at a time, stirring it in, very hard, with the <implement>mush-stick.</implement> If you find the mush too thin, as you proceed, add, in equal portions, more <ingredient>pumpkin</ingredient> and more <ingredient>indian-meal,</ingredient> till it becomes so thick you can scarcely stir it round. After it is all thoroughly mixed, and has boiled well, it will be greatly improved by diminishing the fire a little, or hanging the pot higher up, so as to let it simmer an hour or more. Mush can scarcely be cooked too much. Eat it warm with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> or with <ingredient>rich milk.</ingredient> It is very good at luncheon in cold weather.</p></recipe>
<p>After boiling small hominy, drain off the water, and leave the dish uncovered. If covered up, the condensation of the steam will render the hominy thin and washy.</p>

<p>TEA PARTIES.--Have black tea, green tea, and coffee. Immediately after the first cups are sent in, let fresh tea be put into the pots, that the second cups may not be weaker than the first. With the cream and sugar,

send round a small pot of boiling water to weaken the tea of those who do not like it strong; or for the convenience of ladies who drink only milk and water, and who otherwise may cause interruption and delay by sending out for it. When tea is handed round, it is not well to have hot cakes with it; or any thing that is buttered, or any sort of greasy relishes. Such things are frequently injurious to the gloves and dresses of the ladies, and can well be dispensed with on these occasions. It is sufficient to send round a <implement>waiter</implement> with large cakes of the <emph rend="italic">best</emph> sort, ready sliced but the slices not taken apart. There should be an almond sponge-cake for those who are unwilling to eat cakes made with butter.</p>
<p>Immediately on tea being over, let the servants go round to all the company with <implement>waiters</implement> having pitchers of cold water and glasses, to prevent the inconvenience of ladies sending out for glasses of water.</p>
<p>In less than an hour after tea, lemonade should be brought in, accompanied by baskets of small mixed cakes, (maccaroons, kisses, &#38;c.,) which it is no longer customary to send in with the tea. Afterwards, let the blanc-mange, jellies, sweetmeats, ice-creams, wines, liquors, &#38;c., be handed round. Next, (after an hour's interval,) the terrapin, oysters, and chicken salad, &#38;c. These are sometimes accompanied by ale, porter, or cider; sometimes by champagne. At the close of the evening, it is usual to send round a large plum-cake.</p>
<p>If the plan is to have a regular supper table, it is not necessary to send in any refreshments through the evening, except lemonade and little cakes.</p>
<p>When the company is not very numerous, and is to sit round a tea-table, waffles or other hot articles may there be introduced. Take care to set a tea-table that will certainly be large enough to <alt synonym1="accommodate">accomodate</alt> all the guests without crowding them.</p>

<p>OYSTER SUPPERS.--It is customary at oyster suppers to have a great portion of the oysters roasted in the shell and brought in on large dishes "hot and hot." Near every two chairs should be placed a small bucket to receive the shells. An oyster knife, and a clean coarse towel must be laid beside every plate, for the purpose of opening the oysters; an office that is usually performed by the gentlemen. The oysters should all be of the largest and best kind. Besides those that are roasted, there should be other dishes of them, fried, stewed, and pickled. Also, oysters in pies or patties;--cold-slaw; beets; pickles; and celery; bread in the form of rolls; and butter made up into handsome basket or pine-apple shapes. Ale and porter are frequently introduced at oyster suppers.</p>

<p align="center">A TREATISE<lb/>ON THE<lb/>PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MORAL MANAGEMENT<lb/>OF<lb/>INFANCY.</p>
<p align="center">BY ANDREW COMBE, M. D.<lb/>AUTHOR OF A "POPULAR TREATISE ON PHYSIOLOGY," &#38;C. </p>
<p align="center">WITH<lb/>NOTES AND ADDITIONS,<lb/>BY JOHN BELL, M. D.</p>
<p align="center">In 1 Vol. 12mo.</p>
<p>"The work ought to be in the hands not only of every physician, but should also find a conspicuous place in every family library, and its pages be carefully studied by every one who is or who anticipates to be a parent. Were the precepts and principles it inculcates to be fully carried out by every mother, in the management of her offspring, not merely would their health and comfort be more effectually insured, during infancy, but even in after life they would escape the many infirmities, sufferings, and diseases, the seeds of which are sown in the nursery, when the system there pursued is, as too generally happens, one in direct opposition to the physiological laws of the infantile organism."--<emph rend="italic">American Medical Journal.</emph></p>
<p>"This work is one of the best practical physiological works which has emanated from the  press. Such a work has long been wanted--one to guide the mother safely and surely through the changes of childhood, without violating any of Nature's laws. This treatise embraces a view of infant mortality--the sources of disease in infancy--the delicate constitution of the infant at birth--the food for the child--on the regimen of mother or nurse--artificial nursing and weaning--cleanliness, exercise, sleep, teething, &#38;c. &#38;c. We cannot do a better service to our readers than by earnestly commending this book to their particular attention--there are so many mistakes from ignorance--so many children annually sacrificed to imprudence and want of knowledge--so many predispositions laid for future disease, that it becomes a matter of serious consideration to mothers, whether the evils to which we have adverted cannot be avoided; <emph rend="italic">and as we are satisfied that they may and can,</emph> we hesitate not to assert that all who neglect to obtain this available knowledge are culpable and indeed criminal in a high moral degree."--<emph rend="italic">Sentinel.</emph></p>
<p>"This volume is admirably calculated to give practical information upon some of the most important subjects connected with the mission of 
 
<pb n="advertisement" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=lady&#38;PageNum=414"/>

our race: hence it commends itself to mothers and those intrusted with early infancy. The notes, &#38;c., by the American Editor, give additional value to the work, and make it, indeed, generally suited to this country and climate."--<emph rend="italic">U. S. Gazette.</emph></p>
<p>"A work of much importance. The amount of human life which might be saved by imparting to parents a knowledge of the physiological management of infancy is incalculably great, while the moral treatment of the same tender age, properly understood, would prevent an immense amount of crime and its consequent miseries. The names of Dr. Combe and Dr. Bell afford ample guarantee to the public that this treatise is free from the too common fault of empiricism, and that parents may implicitly trust to its practical directions respecting regimen, &#38;c."--<emph rend="italic">Messenger.</emph></p>
<p>"It abounds with judicious views and practical good sense, and should be attentively read by every parent."--<emph rend="italic">N. Y. Commercial.</emph></p>
<p>"The quantity of information contained in this volume is very great, and its medical and moral appliance to promote the welfare of children displays the sagacity of the observer and the skill of the physician."--<emph rend="italic">Lit. Gazette.</emph></p>
