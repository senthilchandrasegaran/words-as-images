The husband earns, the wife dispenses; are not her duties as important as his?</p><p>If this truth were acknowledged and acted upon, by giving the Science of Domestic Economy a prominent place in Seminaries for Female Education, we should soon witness great improvements in household management.</p><p>There are encouraging signs of reform;--some of the most esteemed among our lady writers have devoted their talents to the illustration of these home duties; the cookery books of Mrs. Child, Miss Leslie, Miss Beecher, and others, have done much for the cause of Domestic Economy. Still it appeared to me that a &quot;new book&quot; on this science, combining features not hitherto included in any work of the kind, was needed. Some of these new features are the following:</p><p>In this work the true relations of food to health are set forth, and <pb n="iv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=4"/> the importance of 
<emph rend="italic">good</emph> cookery to the latter clearly explained. See 'Introductory,&quot; commencing at page vii, and also &quot;Rudiments of Cookery,&quot; pages 67-8.</p><p>&quot;Preparations of Food for the Sick&quot; have been carefully attended to, and many new and excellent receipts introduced.</p><p>&quot;Cookery for Children&quot; is an entirely new feature in a work of this kind, and of much importance.</p><p>A greater variety of receipts, for preparing 
<emph rend="italic">Fish, Vegetables and Soups,</emph> is given here, than can be found in any other book of the kind; these preparations, having reference to the large and increasing class of persons in our country who abstain from flesh meats during Lent, will be found excellent; and useful also to all families during the hot season.</p><p>As our Republic is made up from the people of all lands, so we have gathered the best receipts from the Domestic Economy of the different nations of the Old World; emigrants from each country will, in this &quot;New Book of Cookery,&quot; find the method of preparing their favorite dishes.</p><p>The prominent features are, however, American; my own experience and studies gave some peculiar advantages in understanding &quot;household good;&quot;--and then I have been favored by ladies, famed for their excellent housekeeping, with large collections of original receipts, which these ladies had tested in their own families. I feel, therefore, confident that this &quot;New Book&quot; will be approved.</p><p>It has been my aim to give all directions in a concise, straight-forward manner, and so vary the receipts and modes, that every American household may model its management, to advantage, from the instructions.</p><p>A glance at the copious Index will give some idea of the variety of information the volume contains.</p><p align="right">S.J.H.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Philadelphia, July 1st, 1852.</emph></p><p size="smaller" id="n1"><ref target="n1">*</ref>The publishers intend to issue another work, now in preparation by Mrs. Hale, which will complete this system of Domestic Economy.

<div type="introduction"> <pb n="introduction" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=7"/><hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger" placement="heading">INTRODUCTORY.</hd><p align="center" size="larger">THE PHILOSOPHY OF COOKERY.</p><p>MISS SEDGWICK has asserted, in some of her useful books, that &quot;the more intelligent a woman becomes, other things being equal, the more judiciously she will manage her domestic concerns.&quot; And we add, that the more knowledge a woman possesses of the great principles of morals, philosophy and human happiness, the more importance she will attach to her station, and to the name of a &quot; good housekeeper.&quot;<ref target="n2">*</ref> It is only the frivolous, and those who have been superficially educated, or only instructed in showy accomplishments, who despise and neglect the ordinary duties of life as beneath their notice. Such persons have not sufficient clearness of reason to see that &quot;Domestic Economy&quot; includes every thing which is calculated to make people love home and feel happy there.</p><p>One of the first duties of woman in domestic life is to understand the quality of provisions and the preparation of wholesome food.</p><p>The powers of the mind, as well as those of the body, are greatly dependent on what we eat and drink. The stomach must be in health, or the brain cannot act with its utmost vigor and clearness, nor can there be strength of muscle to perform the purposes of the will.</p><p>But further, woman, to be qualified for the duty which Nature has assigned her, that of promoting the health, happiness and improvement of her species, must understand the natural laws of the human constitution, and the causes which often render the efforts she makes to please the appetite of those she loves, the greatest injury which could be inflicted upon them. Often has the affectionate wife caused her husband a sleepless night and severe distress, which, had an enemy inflicted, she would scarcely have forgiven--because she has prepared for him food which did not agree with his constitution or habits.</p><p size="smaller" id="n2">*The term<emph rend="italic">housekeeper</emph>, in this book, is used in its American signification, the same as &quot;Mistress of the family,&quot; or &quot;Lady of the house.&quot;</p> <pb n="viii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=8"/><p>And many a tender mother has, by pampering and inciting the appetites of her young sons, laid the foundation of their future course of selfishness and profligacy.</p><p>If the true principles of preparing food were understood, these errors would not be committed, for the housekeeper would then feel sure that the best food was that which best nourished and kept the whole system in healthy action; and that such food would be best relished, because, whenever the health is injured, the appetite is impaired or vitiated. She would no longer allow those kinds of food, which reason and experience show are bad for the constitution, to appear at her table.</p><p>We have, therefore, sought to embody, from realiable sources,<ref target="n3">*</ref> the philosophy of Cookery, and here give to those who consult our &quot;New Book&quot; such prominent facts as will help them in their researches after the true way of 
<emph rend="italic">living well</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">being well while we live.</emph></p><p>Modern discovery has proved that the stomach can create nothing; that it can no more furnish us with flesh out of food, in which, when swallowed, the elements of flesh are wanting, than the cook can send us up roast beef without the beef to roast. There was no doubt as to the cook and the beef, but the puzzle about the stomach came of our not knowing what matters various sorts of food really did contain; from our not observing the effects of particular kinds of food when eaten without anything else for some time, and from our not knowing the entire uses of food. But within the last few years measures and scales have told us these things with just the same certainty as they set out the suet and raisins, currants, flour, spices, and sugar, of a plum-pudding, and in a quite popular explanation it may be said that we need food that as we breathe it may warm us, and to renew our bodies as they are wasted by labor. Each purpose needs a different kind of food. The best for the renewal of our strength is slow to furnish heat; the best to give us heat will produce no strength. But this does not tell the whole need for the two kinds of food. Our frames are wasted by labor and exercise; at every move some portion of our bodies is dissipated in the form either of gas or water; at every breath a portion of our blood is swallowed, it may be said, by one of the elements of the air, oxygen; and of strength-giving food alone it is scarce possible to eat enough to feed at once the waste of our bodies, and this hungry oxygen. With this oxygen our life is in some sort a continual battle; we must either supply it with especial food, or it will prey upon ourselves;--body wasted by starvation is simply eaten up by oxygen. It likes fat best, so the fat goes first; then the lean, then the brain; and if from so much waste, death did not result, the sinews and very bones would be lost in oxygen.</p>
<ednote>The following note appears at the bottom of page x.</ednote><p size="smaller" id="n3">*I have followed chiefly the system of Dr. Andrew Combe on &quot;Diet and Health,&quot; corroborated by the authority of Baron Leibeg in his &quot;Familiar Letters&quot; and &quot;Animal Chemistry.&quot;</p><p>The more oxygen we breathe the more need we have to eat. <pb n="ix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=9"/> Every one knows that cold air gives a keen appetite. Those who in town must tickle their palates with spices and pickles to get up some faint liking for a meal, by the sea, or on a hill-side, are hungry every hour of the day, and the languid appetite of summer and crowded rooms, springs into vigor with the piercing cold and open air of winter. The reason of this hungriness of frosty air is simply that our lungs hold more of it than they do of hot air, and so we get more oxygen, a fact that any one can prove, by holding a little balloon half filled with air near the fire, it will soon swell up, showing that hot air needs more room than cold.</p><p>But the oxygen does not use up our food and frames without doing us good service; as it devours it warms us. The fire in the grate is oxygen devouring carbon, and wherever oxygen seizes upon carbon, whether in the shape of coals in a stove or fat in our bodies, the result of the struggle (if we may be allowed the phrase) is heat.</p><p>In all parts of the world, at the Equator and the Poles, amidst eternal ice and under a perpendicular sun, in the parched desert and on the fresh moist fields of temperate zones, the human blood is at the same heat; it neither boils nor freezes, and yet the body in cold air parts with its heat, and just as we can keep an earthenware bottle filled with boiling water, hot, by wrapping it in flannel, can we keep our bodies warm by covering them closely up in clothes. Furs, shawls, and horse-cloths have no warmth in themselves, they but keep in the natural warmth of the body. Every traveler knows that starting without breakfast, or neglecting to dine on the road, he feels more than usually chilly; the effect is very much the same as if he sat to his meals on the same cold day in a room without a fire; the internal fuel, the food, which is the oil to feed life's warming lamp, is wanting. On this account, a starving man is far sooner frozen to death than one with food in his wallet. The unfed body rapidly cools down to the temperature of the atmosphere, just as the grate cools when the fire has gone out. Bodily heat is not produced in any one portion of the body, but in every atom of it. In a single minute about twenty-five pounds of blood are sent flowing through the lungs, there the whole mass meets the air, sucks in its oxygen, and speeding on carries to every portion of the frame the power which may be said to light up every atom of flesh, nerve, and bone, and to keep the flame throughout the body ever burning with the fresh warmth of life.</p><p>In accordance with these facts we find men all over the world acting instinctively. In a cold climate, either by necessity or choice, we exert ourselves, quicken the blood's speed, breathe rapidly, take in oxygen largely; in short, fan the flame which quick-returning hunger makes us feed. Even the least civilized follow correctly the natural law; the fruit so largely eaten by the native inhabitants of the tropics contains in every 100 ozs. not more than 12 of direct heat-producing elements, whilst the blubber and oil of the Esquimaux have in every 100 ozs. somewhere about 80 ozs. of such elements. Nor is it possible without injurious effects to live in opposition to this instinct, <pb n="x" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=10"/> which science has shown to be in strict accordance with the intention of nature.</p><p>So far therefore we have evidence that good may come of method in cookery.<ref target="n4">*</ref> Plum-pudding is no dish for the dog-days, but its suet blunts the keen tooth of winter. Nor is it a mere sentimental sympathy that makes the wish to give the poor a good Christmas dinner. Scant fare makes cold more bitter. Those who, poorly clad, must face the wintry wind unfed, shiver doubly in the blast. The internal fire sinks for want of fuel, and the external air drinks up the little warmth the slow consuming system gives.</p><p>Milk, when a little rennet is poured into it, becomes curd and whey. The curd, chemists call animal 
<emph rend="italic">casein.</emph></p><p>When the water in which the meal of peas, beans, or lentils has been steeped for some time, is warmed, and a little acid is poured into it, it also gives a curd, called 
<emph rend="italic">vegetable casein,</emph>which is precisely the same as the curd of the milk, and contains, like it, all the ingredients of the blood.</p><p>There is, then no difficulty in understanding how one may live on peas, beans, &amp;c., just as on milk or meat.</p><p>When the white of egg is poured into boiling water, it becomes firm; the substance so formed is called animal albumen, and is identical with the albumen of the blood.</p><p>When vegetables are pounded in a mortar, the fresh juice expressed, lets fall a sediment which grass gives out largely, and which is also to be had from all kinds of grain. This deposit is the same as the fibrin or lean of flesh. When the remaining clear piece is boiled, a thick jelly-like substance is formed. Cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and asparagus are especially rich in this coagulating substance, which is the same thing as white of egg or animal albumen. It is called, therefore, vegetable albumen, and is, in common with the white of egg, identical with the albumen of blood, which with the fibrin, whether animal or vegetable, is the source of every portion of the human body.</p><p>We see, therefore, that the cattle have in peas and beans as casein, in corn and grass as fibrin, in sundry vegetables as albumen, the very materials of their flesh; and that, whether we live upon grain or pulse, beef or mutton, milk or eggs, we are in fact eating flesh; in meat, diet ready made; in the case of the others, diet containing the fit ingredients of preparation. Nor are we left in the least shadow of doubt that albumen, of whatever kind, is sufficient to produce flesh, for not only do we find every ingredient of flesh contained in it, but we can turn the flesh and fibrin of the blood back to albumen.<ref target="n4">*</ref></p>
<ednote>The following footnote appears in two sections; the first section appears at the bottom of page x and the second section appears at the bottom of page xi.</ednote><p size="smaller" id="n4">*&quot;The intelligent and experienced mother or nurse chooses for the child,&quot; says Leibig, &quot;with attention to the laws of nature; she gives him chiefly milk and farinaceous food, always adding fruits to the latter; she prefers the flesh of adult animals, which are rich in bone earth, to that of young animals, and always accompanies it with garden vegetables; she gives the child especially bones to gnaw, and excludes from its diet veal, fish, and potatoes; to the excitable child of weak digestive powers, she gives, in its farinacceous food, infusion <pb n="xi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=11"/> of malt and uses milk sugar, the respiratory matter prepared by nature herself for the respiratory process, in preference to cane sugar; and she allows him the unlimited use of salt.&quot;</p><p>But besides the flesh-making ingredients, namely, the albumen and fibrin, we have shown that it is needful the blood should have food for oxygen; this also is contained in milk, grain, pulse, vegetables and meat. In the meat as fat, which more or less the juices of the meat and even the lean contain, in the pulse, grain, potatoes, as starch, in the vegetables, as sugar of various kinds, and in milk, as sugar of milk.</p><p>At first sight, few things seem less alike than starch and sugar, but modern discovery had proved that our saliva--the natural moisture of the mouth (which in its froth, as it is swallowed with every mouthful of food, always contains air) has power, when mixed with moistened starch at the heat of the stomach, to turn the starch into sugar; and again we find that butter and fat contain the same ingredients as starch and sugar, but with this difference, that ten ounces of fat will feed as much oxygen as twenty-four ounces of starch. Grains, vegetables, milk, and meats differ from each other, and amongst themselves in their quantities of flesh-producing and oxygen-feeding substances; but whether the oxygen feeders be in the form of sugar or fat, we can tell exactly how much starch they amount to, and the following list taken from Baron Leibig's Familiar Letters on Chemistry, in this way shows the relative value of the several kinds of food in flesh-producing, and oxygen-feeding, or warmth-giving ingredients.</p><list><item align="right" size="smaller">Flesh Producing.

To begin with the earliest making of dishes, we find that cows' milk has less of oxygen-feeding ingredients in a given measure than human milk; a child would, therefore, grow thin upon it unless a little sugar were added; wheat flour has, on the other hand, so much an excess of oxygen feeding-power as would fatten a child unhealthily, and it should therefore have cows' milk added to reduce the fattening power.</p><p>The same sort of procedure applies in greater or less degree to all dishes. Veal and hare stand lowest in their list for their oxygen-feeding qualities, and, on this account, should be eaten with potatoes or rice, which stand highest, and with bacon and jelly which furnish in their fat and sugar the carbon wanting in the flesh. With the above table before us, and keeping in mind the facts already detailed, it is clear that cookery should supply us with a mixed diet of animal and vegetable food, and should aim so to mix as to give us for every ounce of the flesh-making ingredients in our food, four ounces of oxygen-feeding ingredients. It is clear, also, that the most nourishing or strength-giving of all foods are fresh red meats, they are flesh ready made, and contain, besides, the iron which gives its red color to the blood, being short of which the blood lacks vitality, and wanting which it dies.</p><p>To preserve in dressing the full nourishment of meats, and their properties of digestiveness, forms a most important part of the art of cooking; for these ends the object to be kept in mind is to retain as much as possible the juices of the meat, whether roast or boiled. This, in the case of boiling meat is best done by placing it at once in briskly boiling water; the albumen on the surface and to some depth, is immediately coagulated, and thus forms a kind of covering which neither allows the water to get into the meat, nor the meat juice into the water. The water should then be kept just under boiling until the meat be thoroughly done, which it will be when every part has been heated to about 165 degrees, the temperature at which the coloring matter of the blood coagulates or fixes; at 133 degrees the albumen sets, but the blood does not, and therefore the meat is red and raw.</p><p>The same rules apply to roasting: the meat should first be brought near enough a bright fire to brown the outside, and then should be allowed to roast slowly.</p>
<ednote>The following footnote appears at the bottom of page xii in the original text.</ednote><p id="n5" size="smaller">*&quot;Among all the arts known to man,&quot; says Leibig, &quot;there is none which enjoys a juster appreciation, and the products of which are more universally admired, than that which is concerned in the preparation of our food.</p><p>Belonging to this question of waste and nourishment it is to be noted, that the almost everywhere-agreed-upon notion that soup, which sets into strong jelly, must be the most nutritious, is altogether a mistake. <pb n="xii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=13"/> The soup sets because it contains the gelatine or glue of the sinews, flesh, and bones: but on this imagined richness alone it has, by recent experiments, been proved that no animal can live. The jelly of bones boiled into soup, can furnish only jelly for our bones; the jelly of sinew or calf's feet can form only sinew; neither flesh nor its juices set into a jelly. It is only by long boiling we obtain a soup that sets, but in a much less time we get all the nourishing properties that meat yields in soups which are no doubt useful in cases of recovery from illness when the portions of the system in which it occurs have been wasted, but in other cases, though easily enough digested, jelly is unwholesome, for it loads the blood with not only useless but disturbing products. Nor does jelly stand alone. Neither can we live on meat which has been cleared of fat, long boiled, and has had all the juice pressed out of it; a dog so fed, lost in forth-three days a fourth of his weight; in fifty-five days he bore all the appearance of starvation, and yet such meat has all the muscular fibre in it. In the same way, animals fed on pure casein, albumen, fibrin of vegetables, starch, sugar, or fat, died, with every appearance of death by hunger.</p><p>Further experiment showed that these worse than useless foods were entirely without certain matters which are always to be found in the blood, namely, phosphoric acid, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, oxide of iron,<ref target="n6">*</ref> and common salt (in certain of these we may mention, by way of parenthesis, that veal is especially deficient, and hence its difficulty of digestion and poor nutrient properties.) These salts of the blood, as they are termed in chemistry, are to be found in the several wheys and juices of meat, milk, pulse, and grain. Here then was the proof complete, that such food, to support life, must contain the several ingredients of the blood, and that the stomach cannot make, nor the body do without the least of them.</p><p>It is an established truth in physiology, that man is omnivorous--that is, constituted to eat almost every kind of food which, separately, nourishes other animals. His teeth are formed to masticate and his stomach to digest flesh, fish, and all farinaceous and vegetable substances--he can eat and digest these even in a raw state; but it is necessary to perfect them for his nourishment in the most healthy manner, that they be prepared by cooking--that is, softened by the action of fire and water.</p>
<ednote>The following footnote appears at the bottom of page xiii in the original text.</ednote><p size="smaller" id="n6">*Some determined advocates of the vegetable system maintain, that the teeth and stomach of the monkey correspond, in structure, very closely with that of man, yet it lives on fruits--therefore, if man followed nature, he would live on fruits and vegetables. But though the anatomical likeness between man and monkeys is striking, yet it is not complete; the difference may be and doubtless is precisely that which makes a difference of diet necessary to nourish and develope their dissimilar natures. Those who should live as the monkeys do would most closely resemble them.</p><p>In strict accordance with this philosophy, which makes a portion of animal food necessary to develop and sustain the human constitution, <pb n="xiv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=14"/> in its most perfect state of physical, intellectual and moral strength and beauty, we know that now in every country, where a mixed diet is habitually used, as in the temperate climates, there the greatest improvement of the race is to be found, and the greatest energy of character. It is that portion of the human family, who have the means of obtaining this food at least once a day, who now hold dominion over the earth. Forty thousand of the beef-fed British govern and control ninety millions of the rice-eating natives of India.</p><p>In every nation on earth the 
<emph rend="italic">rulers,</emph> the men of power, whether princes or priests, almost invariably use a portion of animal food. The people are often compelled, either from poverty or policy, to abstain.--Whenever the time shall arrive that every 
<emph rend="italic">peasant</emph> in Europe is able to &quot;put his pullet in the pot, of a Sunday,&quot; a great improvement will have taken place in his character and condition; when he can have a portion of animal food, properly cooked, once each day, he will soon become a 
<emph rend="italic">man.</emph></p><p>In our own country, the beneficial effects of a generous diet, in developing and sustaining the energies of a whole nation, are clearly evident. The severe and unremitting labors of every kind, which were requisite to subdue and obtain dominion of a wilderness world, could not have been done by a half-starved, suffering people. A larger quantity and better quality and better quality of food are necessary here than would have supplied men in the old countries, where less action of body and mind are permitted.</p><p>Still, there is great danger of excess in all indulgences of the appetite; even when a present benefit may be obtained, this danger should never be forgotten. The tendency in our country has been to excess in animal food. The advocates of the vegetable diet system had good cause for denouncing this excess, and the indiscriminate use of flesh. It was, and now is, frequently given to young children--infants beforerhey have teeth,--a sin against nature, which often costs the life of the poor little sufferer; it is eaten too freely by the sedentary and delicate; and to make it worse still, it is eaten, often in a half-cooked state, and swallowed without sufficient chewing. All these things are wrong, and ought to be reformed.</p><p>I hope this &quot;New Book of Cookery&quot; will have some effect in enlightening public opinion on the proper kinds of food, and on the best manner of preparing it.</p><p>It is generally admitted that the French excel in the economy of their cooking. By studying the appropriate flavors for every dish, they contrive to dress all the broken pieces of meats, and make a variety of dishes from vegetables at a small expense.</p><p>Next to the knowledge of the differences in the human constitution, and the nature of the food proper for man, this study of flavors and art of re-cooking to advantage is to be prized by the good housekeeper. Every family who has a garden spot should cultivate those vegetables and herbs which are requisite for seasoning-horse-radish, onions, <pb n="xv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=15"/> celery, mustard, capsicum, (red-pepper,) sage, summer savory, mint, &amp;c. &amp;c. are easily raised. These, if rightly prepared, will be sufficient for all common culinary purposes, and a little care and study will enable the housekeeper to flavor her meats, gravies, and vegetables in the best manner.</p><p>Bear in mind that in preparing food, three things are to be united, the promotion of health, the study of economy, and the gratification of taste.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Times of taking Food.</emph>--Nature has no fixed particular hours for eating. When the mode of life is uniform, it is of great importance to adopt fixed hours; when it is irregular, we ought to be guided by the real wants of the system as dictated by appetite.</p><p>A strong laboring man, engaged in hard work, will require food oftener and in larger quantities than an indolent or sedentary man.</p><p>As a general rule, about five hours should elapse between one meal and another--longer, if the mode of life be indolent; shorter, if it be very active.</p><p>When dinner is delayed seven or eight hours after breakfast, some slight refreshment should be taken between.</p><p>Young persons when growing fast, require more food and at shorter intervals than those do who have attained maturity.</p><p>Children under seven years of age, usually need food every three hours: a piece of bread will be a healthy lunch, and a child seldom eats bread to excess.</p><p>Those persons who eat a late supper should not take breakfast till one or two hours after rising. Those who dine late, and eat nothing afterwards, require breakfast soon after rising.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Proper quantity of Food.</emph>--As a general fact, those who can obtain sufficient food, eat much more than is required for their sustenance.</p><p>Children should never be fed or tempted to eat when appetite is satisfied; and grown persons should also be careful of eating beyond that point.</p><p>The indigestion so much complained of, and which causes so many disorders and sufferings in the human system, is a wise provision of nature, to prevent the repletion which would otherwise ensue, when too much food is taken.</p><p>The power of digestion is limited to the amount of gastric juice the stomach is capable of providing: exercise in the open air, promotes the secretion of the gastric juice.</p><p>It is a good and safe rule to proportion our meals to the amount of exercise we have taken; if that exercise has been in the open air, there is less danger of excess. The delicate lady, who scarcely walks abroad, should live very sparingly, or she will be troubled with nervousness, headache, and all the horrors of indigestion.</p></div>

If they are not kept well tinned also, the taste as well as the color of the soup will be liable to be affected by the iron; and if the soup-kettle be made of copper and the tinning not quite perfect, every thing cooked in it will be in a greater or less degree poisonous as every thing which is sweet, salt, or sour, extracts verdigris from copper.</p><p>Soup must never be suffered to stand in any vessel of tin, or copper, or iron, to get cold; but always must be poured off, while hot, into a shallow, well-glazed earthenware pan, and be stirred about, every five minutes, till it is nearly cold, otherwise, the liquor will become sour.</p><p>Lean, juicy, fresh-killed meat, is best for soup: stale meat will make it ill-flavored; and fat meat is very wasteful. An economical cook will save, as ingredients for soup, the liquor <pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=18"/> in which meat has been boiled; for example, leg of pork liquor may be easily made into peas' soup; and calf's head liquor, and knuckle, be made the base or stock of white soup. The trimmings of undressed meat and game will be useful to enrich soups; and the bones of dressed or undressed meat assist to make a good stock. Ham gives fine flavor, as well as the bone of a dressed ham, taking care to allow for its saltness.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Soft water</emph> should 
<emph rend="italic">always</emph> be used for making soup, unless it be of 
<emph rend="italic">green</emph> peas, in which case 
<emph rend="italic">hard water</emph> better preserves its color; and it is a good general rule to apportion a quart of water to a pound of meat, that is to say, 
<emph rend="italic">flesh</emph> without bone; but rich soups may have a smaller quantity of water.</p><p>Meat for soup should never be drowned at first in water, but put into the kettle with a very small quantity and a piece of butter, merely to keep the meat from burning until the juices are extracted; by which means of stewing the gravy will be drawn from it before the remainder of the water is added. A single pound will thus afford better and richer soup than treble the quantity saturated with cold water.</p><p>The water in the soup-kettle, when first put on, should not be allowed to boil for at least half an hour; else the water will not penetrate, but harden the meat, and keep in the impurities which, in slow heating, will rise as scum. Long and slow boiling, for at least four or six hours, is necessary to extract the strength from meat; but the pot should never be off the boil from the time it commences. The fat should be taken off as it rises. If, however, as is generally thought desirable, the soup should be prepared the day before it is wanted, the fat can be removed when cold, in a cake; and the soup attains more consistence without losing the flavor; but it need not be seasoned till wanted, and then slowly heated till boiling.</p><p>When put away to cool, the soup should be poured into a freshly scalded, and thoroughly dried 
<emph rend="italic">earthen pan;</emph> and, when to be kept for some days, occasionally simmered for a few minutes over the fire, to prevent its becoming mouldy; in re-warming soup be careful not to pour in the sediment.</p><p>All vegetables, bread-raspings, or barley, for plain common soups, when merely intended to thicken and flavor the soup, should be put in as soon as the pot is skimmed; but if the vegetables are to be served in the soup, none, with the exception of onions, should be put down to stew at the same time as the meat, and the different sorts should be put down at different <pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=19"/> times. 
<emph rend="italic">Onions,</emph> whether whole, or sliced and fried, at once; 
<emph rend="italic">pot-herbs, carrots,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">celery,</emph> three hours afterwards; and 
<emph rend="italic">turnips</emph> and others of a delicate kind, only about an hour before the soup is ready.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Spices</emph> should be put whole into soups; allspice is one of the best, though it is not so highly esteemed as it deserves.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Seville orange-juice</emph> has a finer and milder acid than lemon-juice; but both should be used with caution.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sweet herbs,</emph> for soups or broths, consist of knotted 
<emph rend="italic">marjoram, thyme,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">parsley,</emph>--a sprig of each tied together. 
<emph rend="italic">Tarragon</emph> is also used in soups.</p><p>The older and drier onions are, the stronger their flavor; in dry seasons, also, they are very strong: the quantity should be proportioned accordingly.</p><p>Although celery may generally be obtained for soup throughout the year, it may be useful to know, that dried celery-seed is an excellent substitute. It is so strongly flavored, that a dram of whole seed will enrich half a gallon of soup as much as will two heads of celery.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Mushrooms</emph> are much used, and when they cannot be obtained fresh, mushroom ketchup will answer the purpose, but it should be used very sparingly, as nothing is more difficult to remove than the over-flavoring of ketchup.</p><p>A piece of butter, in proportion to the liquid, mixed with flour, and added to the soup, when boiling, will enrich and thicken it. Arrow-root, or the farina or flour of potato, is far better for the thickening of soups than wheaten flour.</p><p>The finer flavoring articles, as ketchup, spices, wines, juice, &amp;c., should not be added till the soup is nearly done.</p><p>A good proportion of wine is, a gill to three pints of soup, this is as much as can be used without the vinous flavor predominating, which is never the case in well made soups. Wine should be added late in the making, as it evaporates very quickly in boiling.</p><p>Be cautious of 
<emph rend="italic">over-seasoning</emph> soups, with pepper, salt, spices, or herbs; for it is a fault that can seldom be remedied: any provision over-salted is spoiled. A tea-spoonful of sugar is a good addition in flavoring soups.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Vermicelli</emph> is added to soups in the proportion of a quarter of a pound for a tureen of soup for eight persons: it should be broken, then blanched in cold water, and is better if stewed in broth before it is put into the soup.</p> <pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=20"/><p>If soups are too weak do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate; but if strong, cover the soup-kettle close. If they want flavor, most of the prepared sauces will give it to meat-soups, and anchovy with walnut ketchup and soy, will add to those of fish, but must be used sparingly.</p><p>If 
<emph rend="italic">coloring</emph> be wanted, a piece of bread toasted as brown as possible--but not blackened--and put into soup to simmer for a short time before its going to be served, will generally be found sufficient. Burnt onions will materially assist in giving a fine brown color to soup, and also improve the flavor, or burnt sugar, the usual browning may be used.</p><p>To clarify soup, put into it, when first set on, the whites of 1 or 2 eggs beaten to a stiff froth; skim the pot constantly, and the liquor will be clear when strained. Soak the napkin in cold water before you strain hot soup through it, as the cold will harden the fat and only allow the clear soup to pass through. Clarifying destroys somewhat of the savor of the soup, which ought, therefore, to be more highly seasoned.</p><p>It is very usual to put force-meat balls, of various sorts, into many different soups, for the purpose of improving their flavor and appearance.</p><p>There is sometimes great prejudice against the use of particular sorts of seasoning and spices. 
<emph rend="italic">Garlic</emph> is amongst these; and many a dish is deprived of its finest flavor for want of a moderate use of it.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Tomatoes</emph> would also be found a great improvement in many kinds of soup. If onions are too strong, boil a turnip with them, and it will render them mild.</p><p>In stirring soup, do it always with a wooden spoon.</p><p>By a 
<emph rend="italic">tureen of soup</emph> is generally meant 3 quarts.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Soup-Herb Powder, or Vegetable Relish,</emph> is an excellent article to keep on hand; it may always be used when fresh herbs cannot be had. Make it in the following manner. Take 
<emph rend="italic">dried parsely--winter savory--sweet marjoram--lemon-thyme </emph>of each 
<emph rend="italic">two ounces; lemon peel, </emph>cut very thin and dried--and 
<emph rend="italic">sweet basil, one ounce</emph> each. Dry these ingredients in a warm (not hot) oven, or by the fire, till you can pound them fine in a mortar, and pass the powder through a hair-sieve. Put this powder in a clean dry bottle, and keep it closely corked. The fragrance will be retained many months. It is an economical and delicious flavoring.</p> <pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=21"/><hd align="center">STOCK.</hd>

An earthen pipkin or jar of this form, if of a long and narrow make, widening a little in the centre, is perhaps one of the best vessels for soups, and universally used by foreign cooks, who insist &quot;that it renders the gravy more clear and limpid, and extracts more savor from the meat, than when made in tin or copper.&quot;</p>

</illustration><p>THE cook should be well acquainted with the signs of freshness and good condition in fish, as many of them are most unwholesome articles of food when stale, or out of season. The eyes should be bright, the gills of a fine clear red, the body stiff, the flesh firm, yet elastic to the touch, and the smell not disagreeable. When all these marks are reversed, and the eyes are sunken, the gills very dark in hue, the flesh itself flabby and of offensive odor, it is bad, and should be avoided. The chloride of soda, will, it is true, restore it to a tolerably eatable state,<ref target="n7">*</ref> if it be not very much over-kept, but it will never resemble in quality fish that is fresh from the water.</p>
<illustration><caption>Small Fish Kettle, called a Mackerel Kettle.</caption><description>An illustration of an oval pot with a handle on the side and the lid.</description>
</illustration><p>A good turbot is thick, and full fleshed, and the under side is of a pale cream color or yellowish white; when this is of a bluish tint, and the fish is thin and soft, it should be rejected.</p><p size="smaller" id="n7">*We have known this applied very successfully to salmon, which from some hours keeping in sultry weather, had acquired a slight degree of taint of which no trace remained after it was dressed.</p> <pb n="29" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=45"/><p>The best salmon and codfish are known by a small head, very thick shoulders, and a small tail; the scales of the former should be bright, and its flesh of a fine red color: to be eaten in perfection, it should be dressed as soon as it is caught, before the curd (or white substance which lies between the flakes of flesh) has melted and rendered the fish oily. In that state it is really 
<emph rend="italic">crimp</emph>, but continues so only for a very few hours.</p><p>The flesh of cod fish should be white and clear before it is boiled, whiter still after it is boiled, and firm though tender, sweet and mild in flavor, and separated easily into large flakes. Many persons consider it rather improved than otherwise by having a little salt rubbed along the inside of the back bone, and letting it lie from 24 to 48 hours before it is dressed. It is sometimes served crimp like salmon, and must then be sliced as soon as it is dead, or within the shortest possible time afterwards.</p><p>Herrings, mackerel, and whitings, lose their freshness so rapidly, that unless newly caught they are quite uneatable. The herring may, it is said, be deprived of the strong rank smell which it emits when broiled or fried, by stripping off the skin, under which lies the oil that causes the disagreeable odor. The whiting is a peculiarly pure flavored and delicate fish, and acceptable generally to invalids from being very light of digestion.</p><p>Eels should be alive and brisk in movement when they are purchased, but the &quot;horrid barbarity,&quot; as it is truly designated, of skinning and dividing them while they are so, is without excuse, as they are easily destroyed &quot;by piercing the spinal marrow close to the back part of the skull with a sharp pointed knife or skewer. If this be done in the right place all motion will instantly cease.&quot; We quote Dr. Kitchener's assertion on this subject; but we know that the mode of destruction which he recommends is commonly practised by the London fishmongers. Boiling water also will immediately cause vitality to cease, and is perhaps the most humane and ready method of destroying the fish.</p><p>Lobsters, pawns, and shrimps, are very stiff when freshly boiled, and the tails turn strongly inwards; when these relax, and the fish are soft and watery, they are stale; and the smell will detect their being so instantly even if no other symptoms of it be remarked. If bought alive, lobsters should be chosen by their weight and &quot;liveliness.&quot; The hen lobster is preferred <pb n="30" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=46"/> for sauce and soups, on account of the coral; but the flesh of the male is generally considered of finer flavor for eating. The vivacity of their leaps will show when prawns and shrimps are fresh from the sea.</p><p>Oysters should close forcibly on the knife when they are opened; if the shells are apart ever so little they are losing their condition, and when they remain far open the fish are dead, and fit only to be thrown away. Small plump natives are very preferable to the larger and coarser kinds.</p><p>Preparatory to the dressing, the fish should be carefully gutted, and afterwards cleaned thoroughly by the cook, from all appearances of blood, particularly scraping the blood that lodges about the back bone, and cutting the fish open for some distance below the vent. If, however, the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done, for common cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &amp;c., from the bone, a very disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but fishmongers generally wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavor. It should, in fact, be handled as little as possible, and never left in the water a moment after it is washed. In washing it, the best way is to hold the fish firmly by the head with your left hand, and scrape off the scales or slime; wash it once in clean cold water, and either dry it with a towel or hang it up and leave it to drain.</p><p>Some kinds, as whiting, bass, cod, and haddock, eat firmer if salt be put into their gills, and they be hung up a few hours before dressing.</p><p>Fish are either boiled, fried, or broiled. Salt may be added to the water in which all kinds of fish are boiled; and the flavor of sea-fish is much improved by boiling it in sea-water. Fish should boil gently, or rather simmer after it has once boiled up, and the water should be constantly skimmed.</p><p>Instead of dissolving salt in the water in which fish are to be boiled, some cooks prefer to steep the fish in salt and water from 5 to 10 minutes, before putting it in the kettle to cook: the necessity of using salt in boiling fish is thus avoided; less scum rises, so that the lid has not to be taken off so often to skim it, and the fish comes to table not only nicer, but with a better appearance.</p><p>Almost all cookery books direct that fish should be put into as much or more water as will cover them, this is also a very <pb n="31" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=47"/> bad way: if the fish be a little more than half covered with water, and gradually brought to boil, then well covered down with your sauce-pan lid, and boiled gently till done, it will eat much richer, have a finer flavor, and be more firm than if cooked the old way, or rather drowned in water, which only soddens fish, and takes away the fine firmness so much prized.</p><p>To render boiled fish firm, put a small bit of saltpetre with the salt in the water in which it is boiled; 1/4 oz. will be sufficient for a gallon.</p><p>To determine when fish is sufficiently boiled, draw it up upon the fish-plate, and if the thickest part of the fish can be easily divided from the bone with a knife, the fish will be done, and should be at once taken from the water, or it will lose its flavor and firmness.</p><p>By most cooks it is considered better to put all fish on in boiling than cold water.</p><p>An oval pan is best adapted to frying fish. Olive oil is best to fry in, but dripping or lard is commonly used. It should boil before the fish is put in it, and be kept gently boiling until the fish is of a yellowish brown color, when it should be taken out and drained.</p><p>To broil fish, have a clear but not fierce fire. Dry the fish in a cloth, season it with pepper and salt, and flour it; then put it on a gridiron, having first rubbed the heated bars with suet, otherwise the fish will stick to them and be broken: it should be often turned in broiling.</p><p>In the dressing of flat fish as 
<emph rend="italic">cutlets</emph>, the fillets should be lifted from the bones, and the spine which runs through the centre of the round sorts should be extracted.</p><p>The 
<emph rend="italic">stewing of fish,</emph> and dressing it in fillets and cutlets, requires considerably more care in the cookery, as well as cost in the ingredients, than either of the previous modes; and as a preliminary to the operation, a gravy should be got ready, to be made in the following manner:--Take out all the bones, cut off the heads and tails, and, if this should not be sufficient, add an eel, or any small common fish; stew them with an onion, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs; strain it, and thicken it to the consistence of cream, flavoring with a slight addition of wine or any other sauce. The French employ the commonest sorts of their wine as a 
<emph rend="italic">marinade,</emph> or sauce, both for the boiling and stewing of fish.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Marinade</emph>--is commonly used in France for the purpose of <pb n="32" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=48"/> boiling fish, which imbibes from it a more pleasant flavor than it naturally possesses, and has been so generally adopted by English professed cooks that we here insert the receipt:--Cut up 2 carrots, 3 onions, 6 shalots, a single clove of garlic, and put them into a stew-pan with a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, and a bundle of sweet herbs; fry the whole for a few minutes, then add, very gradually, 2 bottles of any light wine or of cider. Put in a handful of salt, 2 dozen of peppercorns, the same quantity of allspice, and a couple of cloves. Simmer the whole together for 1 1/2 hour, strain the liquor, and put it by for use.</p><p>This marinade, if carefully strained after the fish has been taken out, will serve several times for the same purpose, adding a little water each time. Fish dressed in it should simmer very gently, or rather stew than boil, as it affords to mackerel, fresh herrings, perch, roach, and any of the small river fish, the advantage of dissolving, or so thoroughly softening their bones, as to render them more agreeable in eating. For large fish, they should be cut into steaks before being marinaded. Instead of the wine or cider, a quart of table-beer, a glass of soy, 1 of essence of anchovies, and 1 of ketchup, may be used; or a pint of vinegar and these sauces, fennel, chives, thyme, and bay-leaves, may be added with the wine, cider, &amp;c. Or, choose a kettle that will suit the size of the fish, into which put two parts water, 1 of light (not sweet) white wine, a good piece of butter, some stewed onions and carrots, pepper, salt, 2 or 3 cloves, and a good bunch of sweet herbs; simmer 15 minutes, let it become cold, then boil the fish therein. Serve with anchovy-sauce and a squeeze of lemon.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fresh-water Fish</emph> are equally nutritious with those of the sea; they are much lighter as food, and therefore easier of digestion; they are, however, more watery, and it is requisite to use salt, in order to extract the watery particles. Every sort of fresh-water fish, ought, therefore, as soon as killed and cleaned, to have salt well rubbed inside and outside, and should be allowed so to remain for some time before it is cooked, when it should be well washed out with pure spring water, and wiped thoroughly dry with a clean cloth.</p><p>If bred in ponds, it often acquires a muddy smell and taste; to take off which, soaking in strong salt and water, or, if of a size to bear it, scalding in the same, will have the proper effect.</p> <pb n="33" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=49"/><p><emph rend="italic">To Preserve Fish Fresh.</emph>--Boil 3 quarts of water and a pint of vinegar, in which, when boiling, put the fish, and scald it for 2 minutes. Then hang up the fish in a cool place, and it will keep for 2 or 3 days, and dress as well as if fresh caught.</p><p>If the fish should happen to freeze they should be placed in cold water without salt, for an hour or so, to thaw them.</p><p>Fish is usually garnished with horse-radish, sliced lemon, or fried parsley; and the roe, melt, and liver. When served up it should not be covered.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fish-kettles</emph> [See cuts at the head of this chapter,] have always a perforated false bottom, with handles affixed, called a fish-strainer, so that it is very easy to take up fish when done, without breaking it; when dished up, it must be slid off this strainer on to a fish-plate, which fits the dish you serve it up in, on which fish-plate a nice clean white napkin is sometimes put to lay the fish on, to absorb all the moisture.</p><p>Some people do not approve of a napkin to lay fish on; in which case, of course, you must only slide the fish off the strainer on to the fish-plate, which you put into a dish that it fits, and serve it up.</p><p>Should it so happen, that the fish is done before it is wanted, or that the family is not ready to sit down, the best way will be to wrap a wet napkin round the fish, and placing it very carefully on the tin strainer, suspend it in the fish-kettle, over so much of the boiling water as will keep it hot, but not touch it. It will thus be kept ready to serve up when wanted; but it will not be near so nice as if it had been sent up to table the moment it was cooked.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Melted butter</emph> to be served with the fish, should be made thicker than when intended for any other purpose, as it is usually thinned at table by one or other of the sauces taken with fish.</p>

Many persons can bear testimony to the truth of Dr. Kitchener's remark, that &quot;elaborate culinary processes are frequently necessary in order to prepare food for the digestive organs.&quot; It may be truly said that many persons ruin their health by over-indulgence in food rendered indigestible by being badly cooked.</p><p>It is our intention to endeavor to correct the prejudice in favor of a family joint--by showing, that it is not only very often improperly cooked, but that the same quantity of meat, if dressed in different ways, still retaining a certain degree of simplicity, will be more pleasant to the palate, more healthful, and quite as economical, if brought to the table, as two or three dishes instead of one.</p><p>In French cookery, those substances which are not intended to be broiled or roasted, are usually stewed for several hours at a temperature below the boiling-point; by which means the most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, are more or less reduced to a state of pulp, and admirably adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the common cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are usually put at once into a large quantity of water, and submitted, <pb n="67" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=83"/> without care or attention, to the boiling temperature: the consequence of which is, that most animal substances, when taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the natural state.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Diet and Digestion.</emph>--From Dr. Beaumont's Tables it appears that the following articles are converted into chyle,

<emph rend="italic">boiling,</emph> or rather 
<emph rend="italic">stewing</emph>, which ought always to be performed over a slow fire. There is, in fact, no error so common among all English and American cooks as that of boiling <ingredient>meat</ingredient> over a strong fire, which renders large joints <ingredient>hard</ingredient> and partly tasteless; while, if simmered during nearly double the time, with less than half the quantity of fuel and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and never allowed to &quot;boil up,&quot; the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> without being too much done, will be found both pliant to the tooth and <ingredient>savory</ingredient> to the palate.</p> <pb n="68" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=84"/><p>For instance. The most common and almost universal dish throughout France, is a large piece of plainly-boiled fresh <ingredient>beef</ingredient> from which the soup--or 
<emph rend="italic">&quot;potage,&quot;</emph> as it is there called--has been partly made, and which is separately served up as 
<emph rend="italic">&quot;bouilli,&quot;</emph> accompanied by strong <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> and minced vegetables, or <ingredient>stewed cabbage.</ingredient> Now this, as constantly dressed in the French mode, is ever delicate both in fibre and flavor; while, in the American manner of boiling it, it is almost always <ingredient>hard</ingredient> and insipid. The reason of which, as explained by that celebrated cook, Car&#234;me, who superintended the kitchen of His Majesty George IV., is this:--&quot;The <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> instead of being put down to boil, as in the English method, is in France put in the pot with the usual quantity of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and placed at the corner of the fireplace, where, slowly becoming hot, the heat gradually swells the muscular fibres of the <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> dissolving the gelatinous substances therein contained, and disengaging that portion which chemists term 'osmazome,' and which imparts savor to the flesh--thus both rendering the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> tender and palatable, and the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> relishing and nutritive; whilst, on the contrary, if the pot be inconsiderately put upon too quick a fire, the boiling is precipitated, the fibre coagulates and hardens, the ozmazome is hindered from disengaging itself, and thus nothing is obtained but a piece of tough <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and a <ingredient>broth</ingredient> without taste or succulence.&quot;</p><p><ingredient>Meat</ingredient> loses by cooking, from one-fifth to one-third of its whole weight. More is lost by roasting than by boiling <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> In calculating for a family, one pound per day for each individual is a general allowance for dinner.</p><p><ingredient>Meat</ingredient> that is not to be cut till cold must be well done, particularly in summer.</p><p>The use of skewers in joints should be avoided as much as possible, as they let out the <ingredient>gravy;</ingredient> twine will answer better, often.</p><p>In every branch of cookery much must be left to the discretion of the cook, and knowledge of the family's taste; particularly in force-<ingredient>meats</ingredient> and seasonings.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Suet.</ingredient></emph>--When <ingredient>sirloins of beef,</ingredient> or <ingredient>loins of veal</ingredient> or <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> are brought in, part of the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify. Chopped fine and mixed with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> if tied down in a jar, it will keep 10 days or a fortnight. If there be more <ingredient>suet</ingredient> than will be used while fresh, throw it into <ingredient>pickle,</ingredient> made in the proportion of one-quarter pound of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to a quart of cold <pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=85"/> <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and it will be as good afterwards for any use, when soaked a little.</p><p>To remove the taint of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> wash it several times in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> then put it into plenty of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> into which throw several pieces of red-hot <ingredient>charcoal.</ingredient> If you fear <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will not keep till the time it is wanted, par-roast or par-boil it, that is, partly cook it; it will then keep two days longer, when it may be dressed as usual, but in rather less time.</p><p>When <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is frozen, it should be brought into the kitchen and laid at some distance from the fire, early in the morning; or soak the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> two or three hours before it is used: putting it near the fire, or into <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> till thawed, should be avoided.</p><p><ingredient>Meats</ingredient> become tenderer and more digestible, as well as better flavored, by hanging. In summer, two days is enough for <ingredient>lamb</ingredient> and <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> and from three to four for <ingredient>beef</ingredient> and <ingredient>mutton.</ingredient> In cold weather, the latter may be kept for double that time.</p><p><ingredient>Legs</ingredient> and shoulders should be hung 
<emph rend="italic">knuckle downwards.</emph></p><p>An effectual way of excluding the fly is by using a wire <ingredient>meat</ingredient>-safe, or by covering the joints with a long loose gauze or some thin cloth, and hanging them from the ceiling of an airy room. <ingredient>Pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> should be sprinkled on the parts likely to be attacked by the fly, but should be washed off before the joint is put to the fire.</p><p>A larder should always be placed on the north side of the house; the window may be closed with canvass, but wire is preferable. There should be a thorough draft of air through the room.</p><p>Articles that are likely to spoil should not be kept in or laid upon wood.</p><p>Warm, moist weather is the worst for keeping <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> the south wind is very unfavorable, and lightning very destructive; so that after their occurrence, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> should be especially examined.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Boiling.</emph>--This is the most simple of all processes of cooking. Regularity and attention to time are the main secrets.</p><p>Much less heat is requisite to keep liquids boiling in copper and iron saucepans than in those made of tin.</p><p>There is frequently a great waste of fuel in cooking, which arises from making liquids boil fast, when they only require to be kept slowly boiling. Count Rumford, (the inventor of <pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=86"/> the Rumford stove,) states, that more than half the fuel used in kitchens is wasted in the above manner.</p><p>It is a sad waste to put fuel under a boiling pot. There is a degree of heat in <ingredient>water</ingredient> called the boiling-point; and all the <ingredient>coals</ingredient> or wood in the world cannot make <ingredient>water</ingredient> hotter in an open vessel; 
<emph rend="italic">it can but boil.</emph> By this waste, the cook not only loses time, but spoils the cookery.</p><p>The average time for boiling fresh <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is from eighteen to twenty minutes for every pound: thus, a joint weighing six pounds will require from one hour and three quarters to two hours boiling. <ingredient>Salted meat</ingredient> requires rather more boiling and <ingredient>water;</ingredient> fresh-killed <ingredient>meat</ingredient> longer time: and all <ingredient>meats</ingredient> longer in cold than warm weather. It is, however, better to be guided, for time, by the thickness of the joint, than by its weight.</p><p>Dried or salted <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and <ingredient>meats</ingredient> require soaking in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> before boiling.</p><p><ingredient>Meat</ingredient> and poultry will lose their flavor and firmness, if left in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> after they are done; as will also <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> which will break to pieces.</p><p>The <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> or poultry has been boiled should be saved: this pot-liquor, as it is called, may be made into soup.</p><p>Slow boiling is very important for all <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> to ensure their tenderness; fast boiling always makes them <ingredient>hard</ingredient> and tough, less plump, and of darker color, than when they are boiled gradually.</p><p>Skimming the pot will alone ensure the good color and sweetness of the <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will aid in throwing up the scum: <ingredient>milk</ingredient> put into the pot does good in few cases only; and wrapping in a cloth is unnecessary, if the scum be carefully removed.</p><p>The lid of the saucepan should only be removed for skimming; and, before taking off the lid, be careful to blow from it any dust or blacks from the fire or chimney.</p><p>The joint should always be covered with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> above this quantity, the less <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the more <ingredient>savory</ingredient> will be the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p><p>In some few instances, however, it may be necessary to boil the articles in a much larger quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient>: a quart of <ingredient>water</ingredient> is mostly a good proportion to a pound of <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p><p>If <ingredient>meat</ingredient> be put into <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> it should be heated gradually, so as not to cause it to boil in less than 40 minutes; if it boil <pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=87"/> much sooner, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will shrink and be hardened, and not so freely throw up the scum.</p><p>Four skewers, or a plate, inside downwards, should be laid on the bottom of the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-pan, especially for large joints and puddings; so that they be equally done, and escape burning, or adhering to the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-pan.</p><p>When a pot boils, remove it nearly off the fire, but let the lid remain on; a very little heat will then keep up the boiling.</p><p>The time of boiling should be reckoned from the time bubbles begin to rise on the surface of the liquid; as the boiling continues, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> will evaporate, and in some cases it may be requisite to fill up the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-pan with <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient></p><p>Vegetables and <ingredient>meat</ingredient> are sometimes 
<emph rend="italic">steamed:</emph> that is, they are put into vessels resembling cullenders, and being placed over <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> the steam from it rises through the holes of the vessel, and then through the vegetables and <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> which are thus as effectually boiled as if they were put into the <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient></p><p><emph rend="italic">Roasting.</emph>--The success of every branch of cookery depends upon the good management of the kitchen fire: roasting, especially, requires a brisk, clear, and steady fire; if made up close to the bars of the grate.</p><p>The spit being wiped clean, the joint to be roasted should be carefully spitted even, and tied tight; and if it will not turn round well, balance skewers, with leaden <ingredient>heads,</ingredient> should be used; for, if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> be not evenly spitted, it will probably be burned on one side, and not done on the other. Avoid running the spit through the prime parts of joints.

<p><purpose rend="italic">To choose <ingredient>Pork.</ingredient></purpose> --This <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is so proverbially, and we believe even 
<emph rend="italic">dangerously</emph> unwholesome when ill fed, or in any degree diseased, that its quality should be closely examined before it is purchased. When not home-fatted, it should be bought, if possible, of some respectable farmer, or miller, unless the butcher who supplies it can be perfectly relied on. Both the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> and lean should be very <ingredient>white,</ingredient> and the latter finely grained; the <ingredient>rind</ingredient> should be thin, smooth, and cool to the touch; if it be clammy, the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> is stale, and should be at once rejected; it ought also to be scrupulously avoided when the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> instead of being quite clear of all blemish, is full of small kernels, which are indicative of disease.</p><p>The manner of cutting up the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> varies in different counties, and also according to the purposes for which it is intended. The <ingredient>legs</ingredient> are either made into <ingredient>hams,</ingredient> or slightly salted <pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=154"/> for a few days and boiled; they are also sometimes roasted when the <ingredient>pork</ingredient> is not large nor coarse, with a <ingredient>savory forcemeat</ingredient> inserted between the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> and flesh of the knuckle.</p><p>The part of the shoulder called the hand, is also occasionally pickled in the same way as <ingredient>hams</ingredient> and <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> or it may be salted and boiled, but it is too sinewy for roasting.

The salt should be rubbed in evenly; first, half the quantity of salt, and, after a day or two, the remainder. The meat should be turned every day, kept covered with the pickle, and rubbed daily, if wanted soon. The brine will serve for more than one parcel of meat, if it be boiled up, skimmed, and used cold.</p><p>In salting beef, the brisket and flat ribs should be jointed, so as to let in the salt, which should also be rubbed well into each piece; the meat should then be put down tightly in the salt-bin, the prime pieces at the bottom, and covered with salt; the coarse pieces being at the top, to be used first.</p><p>Bay-salt gives a sweeter flavor than any other kind. Sugar makes the meat mellow and rich, and is sometimes used to rub meat before salting. Saltpetre hardens meat, so that it is rarely used but to make it red. In frosty weather, warm the salt to ensure its penetrating the meat.</p><p>Remember, that unless meat be quite fresh, it cannot be <pb n="152" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=168"/> kept by salting. Neither will salt recover stale meat; for, if it be in the least tainted before it is put into the pickle, it will be entirely spoiled in one hot day.</p><p>In frosty weather, take care the meat is not frozen, and warm the salt in a frying-pan. The extremes of heat and cold are equally unfavorable for the process of salting. In the former the meat changes before the salt can affect it: in the latter, it is so hardened, and its juices are so congealed, that the salt cannot penetrate it.</p><p>If you wish it red, rub it first with saltpetre, in the proportion of half an ounce, and the like quantity of moist sugar, to a pound of common salt.</p><p>In summer, canvas covers should be placed over salting-tubs to admit air and exclude flies, which are more destructive to salt than fresh meat.</p><p>As our book is designed for

Let them stay in 5 or 6 minutes; then hang them up in a cool place. When drained, pepper and salt the inside well. By this method the most delicate birds may be preserved.

</illustration><p>THE difference between good and bad cookery can scarcely be more strikingly shown than in the manner in which sauces are prepared and served. {Illustration} If well made, appropriate to the dishes they accompany, and sent to table with them as hot as possible, they not only give a heightened relish to a dinner, but they prove that both skill and taste have been exerted in its arrangements. When coarsely and care<emph rend="italic">less</emph>ly prepared, on the contrary, as they too often are, they greatly discredit the cook, and are anything but acceptable to the eaters. Melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> the most common of all--the &quot;<emph rend="italic">one <ingredient>sauce</ingredient></emph>&quot; of England and America, which excites the raillery of foreigners--is frequently found to be such an intolerable compound, either oiled or lumpy, or composed principally of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> that it says but little for the state of cookery amongst us. We trust that the receipts in the present chapter are so clearly given, that if strictly followed they will materially assist the learner in preparing tolerably palatable sauces at the least. The cut at the commencement of the chapter <pb n="192" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=208"/> exhibits the vessel called a &quot;bain marie,&quot; in which <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-pans are placed when it is necessary to keep their contents hot without allowing them to boil: it is extremely useful when dinners are delayed after they are ready to serve.</p>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>SALAD.--The <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> and vegetables for a salad cannot be too freshly gathered; they should be carefully cleared from insects and washed with scrupulous nicety; they are better when not prepared until near the time of sending them to table, and should not be sauced until the instant before they are served. Tender lettuces, of which the outer leaves should be stripped away, <ingredient>mustard</ingredient> and cress, young <ingredient>radishes,</ingredient> and occasionally <ingredient>chives</ingredient> or small <ingredient>green onions</ingredient> (when the taste of a party is in favor of these last) are the usual ingredients of summer salads. Half grown <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> sliced thin, and mixed with them, are a favorite addition with many persons. In England it is customary to cut the lettuces extremely fine; the French, who object to the 
<emph rend="italic">flavor of the knife,</emph> which they fancy this mode imparts, break them small instead. Young <ingredient>celery</ingredient> alone, sliced and dressed with a rich salad mixture is excellent: it is still in some families served thus always with <ingredient>roast fowls.</ingredient></p><p><ingredient>Beet-root,</ingredient> baked or boiled, blanched endive, small salad-<ingredient>herbs</ingredient> which are easily raised at any time of the year, <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> and hardy lettuces, with any ready-dressed vegetable, will supply salads through the winter. <ingredient>Cucumber vinegar</ingredient> is an agreeable addition to these.</p><p>In 
<emph rend="italic">summer salads</emph> the mixture must not be poured upon the <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> or vegetables used in the salad, but be left at the bottom, <pb n="248" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=264"/> to be stirred up when wanted, as thus preserving the crispness of the <ingredient>lettuce.</ingredient></p><p>In 
<emph rend="italic">winter salads,</emph> however, the reverse of this proceeding must be adopted, as thus: the salad of endive, <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>beet,</ingredient> and other roots being cut ready for dressing, then pour the mixture upon the ingredients, and stir them well up, so that every portion may receive its benefit.</p><p>In doing this, it should likewise be recollected that the spoon and fork should always be of wood, and of sufficient size to stir up the vegetables in large quantities.<ref target="n14">*</ref></p>

A little <ingredient>isinglass,</ingredient> half an ounce to a quart of <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> may be used to secure the firmness, particularly in summer. In peeling <ingredient>lemons,</ingredient> care should be taken not to cut below the color, as by so doing a great deal of the flavor of the essential <ingredient>oil</ingredient> is lost, and the <ingredient>white</ingredient> part gives a disagreeable flavor.

In some seasons, the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> is so much richer than in others, that this effect takes place almost before one is aware of it; but the drop which adheres to the skimmer, when it is held up, will show the state it has reached.</p><p>7. Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers for <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> as they will convert the color of <ingredient>red fruit</ingredient> into a dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor.</p><p>8. When cheap jams or <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> are required, make them at once with <ingredient>loaf sugar,</ingredient> but use that which is 
<emph rend="italic">well refined</emph> always, for <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> in general; it is a false economy to purchase an inferior kind, as there is great waste from it in the quantity of scum which it throws up.</p><p>9. Pans of copper or bell-metal are the proper utensils for preserving <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>: when used, they must be scoured bright with sand. Tinned pans turn and destroy the color of the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> that is put into them.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic">PRELIMINARY REMARKS.</purpose> --In making cakes, it is indispensably necessary that all the ingredients should be heated before they are mixed; for this purpose every thing should be prepared an hour before the time it is wanted, and placed near the fire, or upon a stove--the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> thoroughly dried and warmed; the <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> <ingredient>carraway-seed,</ingredient> and anything else required, heated in the same way; <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans or <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> which will give them the requisite degree of temperature. Without these precautions, cakes will be heavy; and the best materials, with the greatest pains, will fail to produce the desired results.</p><p>The following observations should also be strictly attended to:--</p><p><ingredient>Currants</ingredient> should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp, they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are to be used, a dust of dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the cakes to be lighter.</p><p><ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> should be very long beaten, <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> apart, and always strained.</p><p><ingredient>Sugar</ingredient> should be pounded in a mortar, or rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn sieve.</p> <pb n="353" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=369"/><p><ingredient>Lemon-peel</ingredient> should be pared very thin, and, with a little <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> beaten in a marble mortar to a <ingredient>paste;</ingredient> and then mixed with a little <ingredient>wine</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> so as to divide easily among the other ingredients. The pans should be of earthenware; nor should <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> or batter and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> be beaten in tins, as the coldness of the metal will prevent them from becoming light.</p><p>Use no <ingredient>flour</ingredient> but the best superfine; for if the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> be of inferior quality, the cakes will be heavy, ill-colored, and unfit to eat; but if a little <ingredient>potato-flour</ingredient> be added, it will improve their lightness. Cakes are frequently rendered <ingredient>hard,</ingredient> heavy and uneatable, by misplaced economy in <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or for want of a due <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> in <ingredient>spice</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient></p><p>After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated.</p><p>Unless you are provided with proper utensils as well as materials, the difficulty of making cakes will be so great as in most instances to be a failure. Accuracy in proportioning the ingredients is also indispensable; and therefore scales, weights, and measures, down to the smallest quantity, are of the utmost importance.</p><p>When <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is used, a cake should stand for some time to rise, before it is put in the oven.</p><p>All stiff cakes should be beaten with the hand; but pound and similar cakes should be beaten with a whisk or spoon.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic">Of Baking Cake.</purpose> --The goodness of a cake depends almost wholly on careful baking. The oven for large cakes should be pretty quick, or the batter will not rise; <ingredient>paper</ingredient> should be put over the top to prevent their scorching. To judge whether a cake be ready, plunge into the middle a clean knife; draw it out instantly, when, if the blade be sticky, the cake is not done, and should be returned to the oven; if the blade be clean, the cake is ready.</p><p>Great attention should be paid to the different degrees of the heat of the oven for baking cakes: it should be, at first, of a sound heat, when, after it has been well cleaned out, such articles may be baked as require a hot oven; then, such as are directed to be baked in a moderately heated oven; and lastly, those in a slack or cooling oven.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic"><ingredient>Flour.</ingredient></purpose> --The first requisite for 
<emph rend="italic">good <ingredient>bread</ingredient></emph> is that the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> or meal be good. <ingredient>Wheat</ingredient> is always better for being washed; if it be at all injured by smut, it is not fit for food unless it be thoroughly washed. In the country this is easily done.</p><p>Put the grain in a clean tub, a bushel at a time; fill the tub with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and stir the whole up from the bottom, briskly, with your hand, or a stick. Pour off the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and fill it with clean till the <ingredient>water</ingredient> ceases to be colored or dirty. Two or three waters usually are sufficient. Finish the washing quickly as possible, so as not to soak the grain; then spread it thinly on a large, strong sheet, (it is best to keep a coarse unbleached sheet solely for this purpose, if you wash your grain,) laid on clean boards in the sun, or where the sun and air can be freely admitted. Stir the grain with your hand every two or three hours; it will dry in a day, if the weather be fair.</p><p>Fresh-ground <ingredient>flour</ingredient> makes the best and sweetest <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> If you live in the vicinity of a mill, never have more than one or two bushels ground into <ingredient>flour</ingredient> at a time.</p><p>A bushel of good, clear <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> will make 56 pounds of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> beside the bran and middlings.</p><p>If you purchase <ingredient>flour</ingredient> by the barrel or sack, be careful to ascertain that it is good and pure. In Europe, <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is often adulterated, that is, mixed with other substances, to swell its <pb n="375" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=391"/> bulk and weight. 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Whiting,</ingredient> ground stones, and <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> and <ingredient>plaster of Paris,</ingredient></emph> are the ingredients chiefly used. To be sure, none of these things are absolutely poisonous; but they are injurious, and no one wants them in <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> In our country we think such deceptions are seldom attempted, still it may be well to know how to detect the least bad matter in <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p><p>To discover 
<emph rend="italic"><ingredient>whiting,</ingredient></emph> dip the ends of the fore-finger and thumb into <ingredient>sweet oil,</ingredient> and take up a small quantity of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> between them. If it be pure, you may freely rub the fingers together for any length of time, it will not become sticky, and the substance will turn nearly black; if <ingredient>whiting</ingredient> be mixed with the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> a few times rubbing turns it into putty, but its color is very little changed.</p><p>To detect stone dust or <ingredient>plaster of Paris</ingredient>--drop the juice of lemon or a little sharp <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> on a small quantity of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> if adulterated, an immediate effervescence takes place; if pure, it will remain at rest. Another quick, and pretty sure method of trial is to squeeze tightly for a minute a handful of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>--if it be pure, when the hand is opened, the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> will remain in a lump, and the grains or wrinkles of the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> of the hand will be visible; but if it contain foreign substance, it will crumble almost immediately.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic">Making <ingredient>Bread.</ingredient></purpose> --To make the proper quantity for a small family, take 10 quarts of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> put it into a kneading trough, or well-glazed earthen pan, large enough to hold double the quantity of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Make a deep round hole in the centre of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and pour into it half a pint of <ingredient>brewer's yeast,</ingredient> or the thick sediment from home-brewed <ingredient>beer</ingredient>--the last, if good, is to be preferred. In either case the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> must be mixed with a pint of <ingredient>milk-warm water,</ingredient> and well stirred before it is poured in. Then with a spoon stir into this liquid, gradually, so much of the surrounding <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as will make it like thin batter; sprinkle this over with dry <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> till it is covered entirely. Then cover the trough or pan with a warm cloth, and set it by the fire in winter, and where the sun is shining in summer. This process is called &quot;setting the sponge.&quot; The object is to give strength and character to the ferment by communicating the quality of 
<emph rend="italic">leaven</emph>to a small portion of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> which will then be easily extended to the whole. 
<emph rend="italic">Setting sponge</emph> is a measure of wise precaution--for if the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> does not rise and ferment in the middle of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> it shows that the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> <pb n="376" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=392"/> is not good; the batter can then be removed, without wasting much of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and another sponge set with better <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient></p><p>Let the sponge stand till the batter has swelled and risen so as to form cracks in the covering of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> then scatter over it a table-spoonful of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> and begin to form the mass into dough, by pouring in, by degrees, as much <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> as is necessary to mix with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">Ten quarts of <ingredient>flour</ingredient></emph> will require about 
<emph rend="italic">two quarts of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></emph> It will be well to prepare rather more; <ingredient>soft water</ingredient> is much the best; it should in summer be warm as <ingredient>new milk;</ingredient> during winter, it ought to be somewhat warmer, as <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is a cold, heavy substance.</p><p>Add the <ingredient>water</ingredient> by degrees to the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mix them with your hand, till the whole mass is incorporated; it must then be worked most thoroughly, moulded over and over, and kneaded with your clenched hands, till it becomes so perfectly smooth and light, as well as stiff, that not a particle will adhere to your hands. Remember that you cannot have good <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> light and <ingredient>white,</ingredient> unless you give the dough a thorough kneading. Then make the dough into a lump in the middle of the trough or pan, and dust it over with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to prevent its adhering to the vessel. Cover it with a warm cloth, and in the winter the vessel should be placed near the fire. It now undergoes a further fermentation, which is shown by its swelling and rising; this, if the ferment was well formed, will be at its height in an hour--somewhat less in very warm weather. It ought to be taken at its height, before it begins to fall.</p><p>Divide the dough into four equal portions; mould on your <ingredient>paste</ingredient>-board, and form them into loaves; put these on well-<ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed tin or earthen plates, and place them immediately in the oven.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic">Of the Oven.</purpose> --A brick oven, heated with wood, is far superior to any other for baking <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> as well as for most other purposes, being much more easy to regulate, as well as more economical, than an iron one.</p><p>If the brick oven be a good one, it will heat sufficiently in an hour. Kindle the fire with some quick burning material; then fill it up with <ingredient>hard</ingredient> wood, split fine and dried; let the wood burn down, stir the <ingredient>coals</ingredient> evenly over the bottom of the oven, and let them lie till they are like embers. When the oven is sufficiently hot, the bricks at the arch and sides will be clear from any color of smoke. Sweep out the oven: <pb n="377" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=393"/> throw in a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the bottom; if it turns black at once, do not put in the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> but let it stand a few moments and cool.</p><p>It is a good rule to put the fire in the oven when the dough is made up--the latter will rise, and the former heat in about the same time.</p><p>When the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is in the oven it must be kept closed, except it is opened for a moment to see how the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> appears. If the oven is properly heated, loaves of the size named, will be done 1 1/2 or 2 hours. They will weigh 3 1/2 lbs. nearly, per loaf.</p><p>When loaves are done, place them on a clean shelf in a cool pantry. If the crust should be scorched, or the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> too much baked, the loaves, when taken from the oven, may be wrapped in a clean coarse towel, which has been slightly damped. Keep a light cloth over all the loaves. When one has been cut, it should be kept in a tight box to prevent its drying.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Obs.--Three things must be exactly right</emph> in order to have good <ingredient>bread</ingredient>--the quality of the <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> the lightness or fermentation of the dough; and the heat of the oven. No precise rules can be given to ascertain these points. It requires observation, reflection, and a quick, nice judgement, to decide when all are right.</p>

A good mode of roasting is in an earthen basin, placed in an oven with the door open, the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to be frequently stirred with a spoon.

But still people will, at times, be sick and, for these, particular care in preparing food is necessary. Many receipts, suitable for invalids, are scattered through this volume, but we have here brought together such as are more particularly intended for the sick. These preparations, requiring great nicety and exactness, should rarely be left to a domestic.</p><p>One of the loveliest accomplishments of a lady is to understand how to make the invalid in her family comfortable. Food prepared by the kind hand of a wife, mother, sister, friend, has a sweeter relish than the mere ingredients can give, and a restorative power which money cannot purchase. These receipts will enable the watchful attendant to vary the food, as choice or symptoms may render expedient. <ingredient>Jellies</ingredient> and <ingredient>meat</ingredient> broths, together with the various kinds of <ingredient>farina</ingredient>ceous food, are the lightest on the stomach, as well as, generally, the most nutritious for an invalid. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> preparations are useful when <pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=426"/> the <ingredient>lungs</ingredient> are weak.

<recipe class1="medhealth"><p>SOME preparations of <purpose>food proper for the young</purpose> have been given in the course of this work; nevertheless, we are sure a chapter on this important subject, so generally neglected in cookery books, will be welcomed by the judicious.</p><p>It is of great consequence to fix the times of taking food, as well as to regulate the quantity given to a child. The mother should, personally, attend to these arrangements; it is her province.</p><p>There is great danger that an infant, under 3 years of age, will be over-fed, if it be left to the discretion of the nurse. These persons, generally, to stop the screaming of a child, whether it proceed from pain, or crossness, or repletion (as it often does)--they give it something to eat--often that which is very injurious, to tempt the appetite; if it will only eat and stop crying, they do not care for the future inconvenience which this habit of indulgence may bring on the child and its mother.</p><p>Arrange, as early as possible, the regular times of giving food to your children, according to their age and constitution. Young infants require food every 2 hours when awake; after 3 months old, they may go 3 hours--then cautiously lengthen the time, as the child can <ingredient>bear</ingredient> it. But remember that all temperaments are not alike. Some of the same age may require more food than others. One rule, however, will apply to all <pb n="422" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=438"/> --never give a child food to amuse and keep it quiet when it is not hungry, or to reward it for being good. You may as rationally hope to extinguish a fire by pouring on <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> as to cure a peevish temper or curb a violent one by pampering the appetite for luxuries in diet; and all the traits of goodness you thus seek to foster will, in the end, prove as deceptive as the mirage of green fields and cool lakes to the traveller in the hot sands of the desert.</p><p>&quot;My children have very peculiar constitutions,&quot; said an anxious mother--&quot;they are so subject to fevers! If they take the least cold, or even have a fall, they are sure to be attacked by fever.&quot; The family lived high, and those young children had a seat at the table, and were helped to the best and richest of everything. And their luncheon was cake and confectionary.</p><p>It was suggested to the mother that if she would adopt a different diet for those children, give them <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>milk</ingredient> morning and evening, and a plain dinner of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and vegetables, their liability to fevers would be much lessened.</p><p>&quot;My children do not love <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and won't touch plain food&quot;--was the answer, with a sort of triumphant smile, as though this cramming of her children with good things till the blood of the poor little creatures was almost in a state of inflammation, was a high credit to her good housekeeping.</p><p>But do not err on the other hand; and for fear your child should be over-fed, allow it insufficient nourishment. There is not in our country much reason to fear that such will be the case; the danger is, usually, on the side of excess; still we must not forget that the effects from a system of slow starvation are, if not so suddenly fatal as that of repletion, more terrible, because it reduces the intellectual as well as the physical nature of man, till he is hardly equal to the brutes.</p><p>In many parts of civilized and Christian Europe, the mass of the people suffer from being over-worked and under-fed; few may die of absolute starvation, but their term of life is much shortened, and their moral and intellectual powers dwarfed or prostrated.</p><p>&quot;Under an impoverished diet,&quot; says Dr. Combe, &quot;the moral and intellectual capacity is deteriorated as certainly as the bodily&quot;--and he adverts to the work-house and charitable institution system of weak soups and low vegetable diet, and to the known facts that children brought up on such fare are <pb n="423" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=439"/> usually feeble, puny and diseased in body, and are at best but moderate in capacity.</p><p>The rational course seems to be, to feed infants, till about 3 years old, chiefly with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and mild <ingredient>farina</ingredient>ceous vegetable preparations; a large portion of good <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> light, well-baked, and 
<emph rend="italic">cold,</emph> should be given them; after that period, to proportion their solid food to the amount of exercise they are able to take. Children who play abroad in the open air, will require more hearty nourishment, more <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> than those who are kept confined in the house or school-room. From the age of 10 or 12 to 16 or 18, when the growth is most rapid and the exercises (of boys especially) most violent, a sufficiency of plain nourishing food should be given; there is little danger of their taking too much, if it be of the right kind and properly cooked.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose rend="italic">To Make <ingredient>Butter.</ingredient></purpose> --For large quantities of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> the horizontal or barrel churn is the best; the upright or pump churn being adapted for making <ingredient>butter</ingredient> from the produce of a few <ingredient>cows</ingredient> only.</p><p>In Summer, you should churn 3 times a week, or twice a week at least; the churn ought then to be chilled with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> before the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is put into it, as well as whilst churning; and in Winter the churn should be soaked some time in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> before it is used.

The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be kept at a moderate temperature. The greatest quantity of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is obtained at 60 degrees, and the best quality at 55 degrees, in the churn, just before the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> comes. At a higher heat, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> comes quicker, but in less quantity, and of inferior quality. But when the heat is below 50 degrees, it may be brought up to the temperature required by placing the churn in <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> but it will be better to wait; as <ingredient>butter</ingredient> thus hastened by <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> is worse than that which is <ingredient>turnip</ingredient>-flavored.</p><p>In the course of an hour's churning, more or less, according to circumstances, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will come, when the churn should <pb n="431" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=447"/> be opened, and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> taken out and put into a shallow pan or tub.

<formula class="household"><p>THE MISTRESS.--Far the greater proportion of households, throughout our whole country, are managed without the aide of much hired help, by the females of each family. The maxim, &quot;If you would be well served, you must serve yourself,&quot; has considerable truth in it; at least those families who serve themselves, escape many vexations of <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> because, if the work be not very well done, when we do it with our own hands, we are more apt to be satisfied. There are some sorts of domestic work, that of dairy work is one, which no hired help would be competent to discharge. This must be done by a wife or daughter, who feels a deep personal interest in the prosperity of her husband or father. Many of our farmers' wives are among the best housekeepers in the land, possessing the good sense, vigor of mind, native delicacy of taste or tact, and firm conscientiousness, which gift the character with power to attempt everything that duty demands. These are the &quot;noble matronage&quot; which our republic should honor. It is the sons of such mothers who have ever stood foremost to defend or serve their country--</p><p size="smaller">&quot;With word, or pen, or pointed steel.&quot;</p><p>One of the greatest defects in the present system of female <pb n="438" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=454"/> education, is the almost total neglect of showing the young lady how to apply her learning so as to improve her domestic economy. It is true that necessity generally teaches, or rather obliges her to learn this science after she is married; but it would have saved her from many anxious hours, and tears, and troubles, if she had learned how to make <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> and cook a dinner before she left her father's house; and it would have been better still, if she had been instructed at school to regard this knowledge as an indispensable accomplishment in the education of a young lady.</p><p>I was once told by a lady of Boston, that, when she was married, she scarcely knew how a single dish should be prepared. The first day of her housekeeping, the cook came for orders--&quot;What would she have for dinner?&quot;</p><p>The lady told her, among other items, that she would have an <ingredient>apple</ingredient> pudding.</p><p>&quot;How shall I make it?&quot; was the question which the lady was unable to answer--she knew no more how to make a pudding than to square a circle. She evaded the question as well as she could, by telling the girl to make it in the usual way. But the circumstance was a powerful lesson on the inconveniences of ignorance to the housekeeper. The lady possessed good sense, and was a woman of right principles. She felt it was her duty to know how to order her help--that wealth did not free her from responsibility in her family. She set herself diligently to the study of cookery; and, by consulting friends, watching the operations of her servants, and doing many things herself, she has become a most excellent housekeeper.</p><p>For the young bride, who is entirely ignorant of her house-hold duties, this is an encouraging example; let her follow it, if she would be happy and respected at home. But it would be better to begin her lessons a little earlier; it is not every woman who has sufficient strength of mind to pursue such a rigid course of self-education. And no lady can be comfortable, unless she possess a knowledge of household work; if she need not perform it herself, she must be able to teach her help, otherwise she will always have 
<emph rend="italic">bad servants.</emph></p><p>I am aware that it is the fashion with many ladies to disparage Irish domestics, call them stupid, ignorant, impudent, ungrateful, the plagues of housekeeping. That they are ignorant, is true enough; it does require skill, patience, and judgment, <pb n="439" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=455"/> to teach a raw Irish girl how to perform the work in a gentleman's family; but they are neither stupid nor ungrateful, and if they are taught in the right manner, they prove very capable, and are most faithful and affectionate domestics.</p><p>A friend of mine, who is just what a woman ought to be, capable of directing--even 
<emph rend="italic">doing,</emph> if necessary--in the kitchen as well as shining in the drawing-room, hired one of these poor Irish girls, new from the land of the Shamrock, who only understood the way of doing work in a hovel, yet, like all her class, she said, &quot;Sure couldn't she do anything the lady wanted?&quot; The lady, however, did not trust the girl to make any experiments, but went to the kitchen with her, and taught her, or rather did the work herself, and allowed the 
<emph rend="italic">help</emph> to look on and learn by example, which for sure is much more effectual than lectures. When the dinner was nearly ready, the lady retired to dress, telling Julia to watch the roast, and she would return soon, and show her how to prepare it for the table. We may imagine with what utter bewilderment the poor girl had been overwhelmed during this, her first lesson in civilized life. The names of the articles of furniture in the kitchen, as well as their uses, were entirely unknown to her; and she had seen so many new things done, which she was expected to remember, that it must have made her <ingredient>heart</ingredient>-sick to reflect how much she had to learn. But there was one thing she though she understood--which was to cook <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>. These were done, and she would show the lady she knew how to prepare them for the table.</p><p>When the lady returned, she found the girl seated on the floor, the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> in her lap, while she, with a very satisfied look, was peeling them with her fingers!</p><p>Are there not ladies who would have exclaimed--&quot;Oh, the stupid, ignorant, dirty creature! She cannot be taught to do my work. I must send her away!&quot; And away she would have been sent, irritated if not discouraged, and perhaps with out knowing a place where to lay down her <ingredient>head</ingredient> in this strange country.</p><p>My friend did not act in this manner--she expressed no surprise at the attitude of the girl, only quietly said--&quot;That is not the best way to peel your <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>, Julia--just lay them on this plate, and I will show you how I like to have them done.&quot;</p><p>That Irish girl remained a servant in the same family for 5 <pb n="440" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=456"/> years, proved herself not only capable of learning to work, but willing and most devoted in the service of her mistress, whom she regarded with a reverence little short of what a Catholic feels for his patron saint.<ref target="n34">*</ref> And thus, if with patience and kindness these poor Irish girls are treated and taught, may good and faithful help be obtained.</p><p>But unless ladies know how the work should be done, and are willing to teach their domestics, they should not employ the Irish when they first arrive.</p><p>Those who do employ and carefully instruct this class of persons, perform a most benevolent act to the usually destitute exiles, and also a good service to the community, by rendering those who would, if ignorant, become a burden and a nuisance, useful and respectable members of society.</p><p>To educate a good domestic is one of the surest proofs that a lady is a good housekeeper.</p>

And if you are, as is generally the case, out of employment for a week before you go to a new place, you lose your time; and often have to pay for board too; thus a loss of 2 or 3 weeks' wages is incurred, because you will not <ingredient>bear</ingredient> to be reproved, even for a fault. What folly! thus to punish yourself for the sake of punishing your mistress, even if she did blame you without cause. The better way is to remain <pb n="441" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=457"/> and behave so well that she shall be made to acknowledge your excellence; which she will be pretty sure to do, if she finds you faithfully try to please her.</p><p>Do not think it degrades you to endeavor to please your employer. It surely adds to your respectability, for it shows that you live with people you respect. You are bound to please your employers as far as you honestly can, while you receive your wages. No person hires a domestic to be idle, cross, or disrespectful. It is worse than theft to take wages from your employers which you must know you have not earned, if you have been unfaithful, impertinent, and quarrelsome, and made them constant trouble.</p><p>Resolve, therefore, when you go as

<emph rend="italic">help</emph> indeed; which you will be, if you practice the following rules:--</p><p>Always treat your employers with respect.</p><p>Be faithful and honest in managing all that they entrust to you.</p><p>Be kind and obliging to every body, particularly to all the domestics of the family.</p><p>In a word--do to others in all things, as you would wish them to do by you in similar circumstances.</p><p>If you conduct thus, you will, though working in the kitchen, be as really respectable and independent as the lady in the parlor. In truth, she will be more dependent on your assistance than you will be on her for employment, and she will feel this, and treat you with the consideration and kindness which your merit deserves. But do not presume on this favor, and grow slack and careless. As long as you find it necessary to receive wages, be conscientious to perform all your duties as help.</p><p>Never think any part of your business too trifling to be well done.</p><p>The foregoing are general rules; a few particular directions may be needed.</p><p>One of the faults which a cook should most seriously guard against, is bad temper. She has a good many trials. Her employment, in the summer season, is not a pleasant or healthy one--obliged, as she is, to be over the hot fire, and confined, often, in a dark, close kitchen. Then she sometimes has a difficult lady to please, who does not know when the work is well done, and often gives contradictory or impracticable orders.</p> <pb n="442" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=458"/><p>And the other domestics frequently interrupt the arrangements of the cook; or, she is not furnished with proper implements and articles. All these things try her patience, and if it 
<emph rend="italic">sometimes</emph> fails, we ought not too much to blame her. But she need not be always 
<emph rend="italic">cross.</emph> And she should remember, too, her privileges--mistress of the kitchen, the highest wages, and, if she conducts well, the favorite always of her employers.</p><p>It is in the power of the cook to do much for the comfort and prosperity of the family. If she is economical and conducts with propriety, the whole establishment goes on pleasantly; but if she is cross, intemperate, and wasteful, the mischief and discomfort she causes are very great. Never let the family have reason to say--&quot;The cook is always cross!&quot;</p><p><emph rend="italic">Intemperance</emph> is said to be the failing of cooks, oftener than of other domestics. It is a vice which, if persisted in, will soon destroy the character and usefulness of the cook. Every one who desires to sustain a respectable station in her employment, must abstain totally from spirituous liquors. &quot;Touch not, taste not, handle not.&quot; It is poison to your blood; it is death to your reputation, if not to your body and soul.</p><p>Country girls who come to the cities as help, because they can there obtain large wages, should be careful in their diet. Remember that as you cannot take so much exercise in the open air, you must live sparingly at first, or the change will injure your health. And all that injures the health, injures also the bloom and beauty of youth.</p><p>To take a young woman, one of our farmer's daughters, from the free, pure air of the country, and confine her in the hot kitchen, often under ground, of one of our crowded city establishments, is such a change, that unless she is very particular in her care of herself, will soon cause her to look old, haggard, and disagreeable. Her hair will be often matted with sweat and dust, and her complexion like a mummy. To avoid these unpleasant results, let the cook, from the first, adopt the following rules:--</p><p>1st. Eat regular meals, instead of tasting of every good thing you cook, till you have no appetite for food.</p><p>2d. Keep your sleeping room well aired, and your <ingredient>skin</ingredient> clean.</p><p>The best way is to wash yourself thoroughly when going to bed; comb your hair also, and wear a night-cap or handkerchief <pb n="443" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=459"/> on your <ingredient>head.</ingredient> The next morning, you will only require to smooth your hair, not take it down, and wash your face and hands. It would look neater, and keep your hair much smoother, if you would wear a cap or handkerchief while at work, as English servants do.</p><p>Let your dress be of good, durable materials, that will wash well; keep it clean as possible, and always wear an apron.</p><p>In the afternoon, when the work is done, then you can wash and dress as neatly as you choose, only remember that a domestic in a showy, flimsy gown, and decked out with pinch-beck rings and <ingredient>ear</ingredient> ornaments, always makes a ridiculous figure in the eyes of every sensible person; because such persons see that you are spending your <ingredient>hard</ingredient>-earned wages for that which really does you no good.</p><p>Keep your kitchen, and all the utensils, clean and <ingredient>neat</ingredient> as possible. Sweep the chimney often. with an old broom kept for the purpose, so that no <ingredient>soot</ingredient> may collect to fall down on the dishes at the fire, and be sure that the hearth is <ingredient>neat</ingredient> as a table.</p><p>Always have plenty of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> ready; and take care that your wiping cloths are washed every day.</p><p>The three rules you must follow, if you would always have your work done well, are these:--</p><p>&quot;Do every thing at the proper time.<lb/>Keep every thing in its proper place.<lb/>Use every thing for its proper purpose.&quot;</p><p>If your mistress professes to understand cookery, the best way will be to follow her directions; if you find the dish is not as good as when you cooked in your own way, respectfully ask her to let you try once alone. But never be angry or pout when you are told how your employer wishes to have the work done.</p><p>The great fault of the Irish 
<emph rend="italic">help</emph> is, that they undertake to do what they have never learned. They will not acknowledge their ignorance; if they would do this, and patiently try to learn, they would soon, with their natural quickness, become good cooks--if they have good teachers. And what a privilege and blessing it is to a poor Irish girl, who has only lived in a hovel, with scarcely an article of furniture, save the pot &quot;to boil the praties,&quot; to be instructed in household work! It is really a fortune to her; she can then always have good <pb n="444" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=460"/> places and good pay, and soon clothe herself well, and lay up money.</p><p>There are benevolent and sensible ladies who do act thus kindly by the Irish girl; not only teach her how to work in the kitchen, but teach her needlework, and instruct her in reading and writing.</p><p>If you have had such a kind mistress, my poor girl, for the honor of old Ireland be grateful and faithful to your benefactress; and show yourself worthy to be the mother of American citizens; for to such good fortune your children, should you marry, will be entitled.</p><p>There is no danger that our domestics will have too much ambition, if it be of the right kind--the ambition of doing their duty as faithful, capable 
<emph rend="italic">help,</emph> while they continue to work for others. But I would wish every young female domestic to 
<emph rend="italic">hope</emph> that she may some time be mistress of her 
<emph rend="italic">own house;</emph> and I would urge her to improve every opportunity she has of learning the best and most prudent manner of doing all kinds of work. Then she will be fitted to make her husband happy, and bring up her children to be respectable members of society.</p><p>One of the most certain evidences that she is worthy to enjoy prosperity, is her faithfulness to promote the interest of those for whom she works. If she is really trustworthy, she will show it in her conduct.</p><p>There is a class of cooks who cannot be trusted; every thing they dare take is slyly carried out of the house, and given to their friends; and they go on with this system of pilfering till they are turned away from every respectable place.</p><p>Do not be tempted to begin this system, nor think that the broken bits, which the family may not need, belong to you. The mistress of the house must manage these charities; ask her, and if she give you leave to dispose of the broken pieces, be very careful not to 
<emph rend="italic">make fragments</emph> unnecessarily for the sake of giving them to your poor relations.</p><p>Act, in all these things, as you would if your employer was looking on you; and forget not that One, to whom you are more responsible than to any earthly master or mistress, is constantly watching you.</p>

<formula class="etiquette"><p><purpose>MANAGEMENT OF A DINNER.</purpose> --As a dinner affords the best proof of the management of a household, a few hints upon the subject may be useful to the <ingredient>heads</ingredient> of families.</p><p>The comfort of dinner-guests depends much upon the proper regulation of the temperature of the dining-room. In hot weather, this may be effected by ventilation and blinds. In winter, there is little difficulty to accomplish this with a bright blazing fire, and due care.</p><p>In families where a dinner is seldom given, it is better to hire a cook to assist in dressing the dinner, than to engage an uninformed person.</p><p>In selecting dinners, you should provide for the party such dishes as they are not most used to, and those articles which you are most in the way of procuring of superior quality.</p><p>Large dinner-parties, as 14 or 16 in number, are rarely so satisfactory to the entertainer or the guests as small parties of 6 or 8 persons. The latter, especially, are pleasant numbers.</p><p>Everything that unites elegance with comfort, should be attended to, but elegance ought to give way at all times to comfort. Two or three cloths make the table look much handsomer; and it is astonishing how meagre to an eye accustomed to that style, a table with only one appears; but this may be easily obviated, if the cloth is not removed during the service, by having a stout coarse one under it, or a scarlet <pb n="451" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=467"/> cloth under a fine thin damask, gives it an imperceptible glow; but, if such is used, the cloth must not be taken off, as nothing can look well in removing but linen. A scarlet cloth, fitted to the table, and laid between the table-cloths, <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> the polish, as well as adds to the appearance.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Finger Glasses,</emph> half filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> should be got ready to be set upon the table with the dessert.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Bread</ingredient></emph> should never be cut less than one inch and a half for dinner.</p><p>To ensure a well-dressed dinner, provide enough, and beware of the common practice of having too much. The table had better appear rather bare than crowded with dishes not wanted, or such as will become cold before they are partaken of. This practice of overloading tables is not only extravagant but troublesome. The smaller the dinner, when sufficient, the better will be the chance of its being well cooked.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Vegetables,</emph> in abundance and well dressed, are important in a dinner; and it is a good plan to serve a fresh supply with each dish, to ensure them hot. In France, more attention is paid to the dressing of vegetables than in this country or in England; and the French, consequently, produce these cheap luxuries in high perfection.</p><p>Before a dish is placed upon the table, its sauces and vege tables should be set in their proper places.</p><p>Between the serving of each dish should be a short interval, which will not only be pleasant to the guests, but will give time to the cook and attendants.</p><p>There should be a reserve of sauces as well as of vegetables; for nothing lessens the enjoyment of a dinner so much as a short supply of these adjuncts.</p><p>A chief point to be attended to for a comfortable dinner is, to have what you want, and when you want it. It is vexatious to wait for first one thing and then another, and to receive these little additions, when what they belong to is half or entirely finished.</p><p>One or more sets of cruets, according to the size of the party, should be placed upon table; the cruets should contain such articles as are continually wanted, and special attention should be paid to the freshness of their contents, as of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> sauces.</p><p>Much money is often unnecessarily expended in pastry and desserts. A few kinds of ripe <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> in season, and not forced <pb n="452" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=468"/> are sufficient; though the morning is the best time for eating <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient></p><p>Wines should vary with the season; light wines are best in summer; in winter, generous wines are preferred. <ingredient>White wine</ingredient> is drunk with <ingredient>white meats,</ingredient> and red with brown <ingredient>meats.</ingredient> Light wines are suitable to light dishes, and stronger wines to more substantial dishes. In summer, <ingredient>wine</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> cooled by a piece of ice being put into it, is a luxury; as is also a bottle of iced <ingredient>water</ingredient> (the best beverage) and bottled porter iced.</p><p><ingredient>Wine</ingredient> is often set upon the table before it is wanted, for show; so that it loses its proper temperature before it is required to be drunk.</p><p>Do not press persons to eat more than appears agreeable to them, nor insist upon their tasting any particular dish.</p><p>It is a good custom to send <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> into the dining-room before the gentlemen leave the table. The hour for sending in the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> should be previously appointed, so that the bell need not be rung for it. Two or three hours are a proper interval between the dinner hour and <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p><p>Servants who wait at table should wear clean <ingredient>white</ingredient> linen gloves.</p><p>There are a few points of the etiquette of a dinner-party, which it may be useful to particularize.</p><p>The members of the party having assembled, the master or mistress of the house should point out which lady each visitor is to take into the dining room, the married having precedence of the single.</p><p>The lady of the house should take the <ingredient>head</ingredient> of the table, and be supported by the two gentlemen of the most consideration, who should assist her to carve. The gentleman of the house should take the bottom of the table, and on each side of him should be seated the two ladies whose age or station gives them precedence.</p><p>As well-bred people arrive as punctually as they can to the appointed hour, the dinner should not be kept waiting after that time.</p><p>In serving soup, one ladleful to each plate is sufficient.</p><p>A knife applied to a <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is likely to spoil the delicacy of its flavor; so that a slice only should be used in helping <ingredient>fish.</ingredient></p><p>Do not pour <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> over <ingredient>meat</ingredient> or vegetables, but a little on one side.</p> <pb n="453" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=469"/><p>In helping at table, never employ a knife where you can use a spoon.</p><p>In giving dinners, avoid ostentation, which will not only be very expensive, but will make your guests uncomfortable. Again, it is not merely the expense, but the trouble and fuss of dinner-giving on the extravagant system, that checks the extended practice of giving dinners, and imposes a restraint upon sociable enjoyment.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>One of the most important acquisitions in the routine of daily life is the ability to carve well, and not only well but elegantly. It is true that the modes now adopted of sending <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> &amp;c. to table are fast banishing the necessity for promiscuous carving from the elegantly served boards of the wealthy; but in the circles of middle life, where the refinements of cookery are not adopted, the utility of a skill in the use of a carving knife is sufficiently obvious.</p><p>Moreover, the art of carving is a very requisite branch of domestic management; it not only belongs to the 
<emph rend="italic">honors of the table,</emph> but is important in an economical point of view; for a joint of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> ill carved, will not serve so many persons as it would if it were properly carved.</p><p>Ladies ought especially to make carving a study; at their own houses they grace the table, and should be enabled to perform the task allotted to them with sufficient skill to prevent remark, or the calling forth of eager proffers of assistance from good natured visitors near, who probably would not present any better claim to a <ingredient>neat</ingredient> performance.</p><p>In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in a dish sufficiently large for turning it if necessary; but the dish itself should not be moved from its position, which should be so close before the carver as only to leave room for the plates. The carving knife should be light, sharp, well-tempered, and of a size proportioned to the joint, strength being less required than address in the manner of using it. Large solid joints, such as <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>fillet of veal,</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt beef,</ingredient> cannot be cut too thin; but <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> <ingredient>roast pork,</ingredient> and the other joints of <ingredient>veal</ingredient> should never be served in very slender slices.</p><p>There are certain choice cuts, or delicacies, with which a good <pb n="454" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=ldnw&#38;PageNum=470"/> carver is acquainted; among them are the sounds of <ingredient>cod-fish,</ingredient> the thin or <ingredient>fat of salmon,</ingredient> the thick and fins of turbot; the <ingredient>fat of venison,</ingredient> <ingredient>lamb</ingredient> and <ingredient>veal kidney,</ingredient> the pope's eye in a <ingredient>leg of mutton,</ingredient> the <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> and <ingredient>neck of a pig;</ingredient> the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> and <ingredient>wings of a fowl,</ingredient> the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and back of a <ingredient>hare,</ingredient> and its <ingredient>ears</ingredient> being by some persons considered a great delicacy; the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> and <ingredient>thighs</ingredient> (without the drumsticks,) of <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> and <ingredient>goose,</ingredient> the <ingredient>wings</ingredient> and <ingredient>breast of game,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and <ingredient>breast of ducks.</ingredient></p><p><ingredient>Fish</ingredient> should be helped with a silver slice or trowel, care being taken not to break the handsome flaky pieces; a portion of the <ingredient>liver</ingredient> and <ingredient>roe</ingredient> should be served to each person.</p><p>Much of the enjoyment of the party will depend on the <ingredient>stuffing,</ingredient> <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient> sauces, &amp;c., being fairly apportioned to each plate.</p><p>By aid of the following instructions, occasional practice, and by closely observing &quot;good carvers,&quot; the learner may soon become proficient in this important branch of the honors of the table.</p>
