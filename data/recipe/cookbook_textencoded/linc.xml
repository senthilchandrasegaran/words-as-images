<hd align="center" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>To compile a book which shall be not only a collection of receipts, given briefly for the experienced housekeeper and with sufficient clearness for the beginner, but which shall also embody enough of physiology, and of the chemistry and philosophy of food, to make every principle intelligible to a child and interesting to the mature mind; which shall serve equally well for the cook in the kitchen, the pupil in the school-room, and the teacher in the normal class,--is a difficult task. Yet the need of a book of moderate cost, containing in a reasonably small compass all this and much more, has been seriously felt by all who are engaged in teaching cookery. Moreover, there is a special reason for the publication of this work. It is undertaken at the urgent request of the pupils of the Boston Cooking School, who have desired that the receipts and lessons given during the last four years in that institution should be arranged in a permanent form.</p><p>To one who from childhood has been trained in all details of housework, learning by observation or by actual experience much that it is impossible to receive from books, the amount of ignorance shown by many women is surprising. That a person of ordinary intelligence presiding over her household can be satisfied with only a vague conception of the common domestic methods, or that any true woman can see anything degrading in any labor necessary for the highest physical condition of her
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=12"/>

family, would be incredible if the truth of it were not daily manifest.</p><p>Happily, popular opinion now decides that no young lady's education is complete without a course of training in one or more branches of domestic work. And those who are not so fortunate as to have the best of all training--that of actual work under a wise and competent mother--gladly resort to the cooking-schools for instruction.</p><p>In compiling these receipts for use in a school and in the family, several things were demanded. In a school of pupils from every class and station in life, a great variety of receipts is desirable. They must be clear, but concise, for those who are already well grounded in first principles. They must be explained, illustrated, and reiterated for the inexperienced and the careless. They must have a word of caution for those who seem always to have the knack of doing the wrong thing. They must include the most healthful foods for those who have been made ill by improper food; the cheapest as well as the most nutritious, for the laboring class; the richest and most elaborately prepared, for those who can afford them physically as well as pecuniarily.</p><p>These receipts are not a mere compilation. A large portion have accumulated during a long period of house-keeping; and many have been received from friends who are practical housekeepers. Others have been taken from standard authorities on cooking; and all have been frequently and thoroughly tested by pupils under the eye of the author. As far as possible, acknowledgement has been made for the receipts received. Where changes and improvements have been made, or where there were many authorities for the same formula, no credit has been given.</p><p>Some cook-books presuppose the presence of an assistant; but as three fourths of the women in this country
 
<pb n="vii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=13"/>

do their own work, these receipts are arranged so as to require the attention of but one person.</p><p>It is proverbial that young housekeepers are often greatly perplexed in attempting to provide little enough for only two. For their benefit many of our receipts are prepared on a scale of smaller measurements.</p><p>The materials to be used are given in the order in which they are to be put together. They are arranged in columns, where the eye may catch them readily, or in <emph rend="italic">italics</emph> where economy of space seemed desirable.</p><p>Every caution or suggestion has been given at the request of some pupil who failed to find in other books just what she needed; or because, in the experience of teaching, it has been shown that, unless forewarned, pupils inevitably make certain mistakes. Many subjects which in other books are omitted or given briefly, will be found to have received here an extensive treatment, because they have seemed of paramount importance.</p><p>All the chemical and physiological knowledge that is necessary for a clear understanding of the laws of health, so far as they are involved in the science of cookery, is given in this book. Nine tenths of the women who go through a scientific course in seminaries never put any of the knowledge gained into practical use. By the time they have occasion to use such knowledge in their own homes, the Chemistry and Physiology have been relegated to the attic, where they help mice to material for their nests, but help no woman to apply the principles of science upon which the health and welfare of her household largely depend.</p><p>The statement will appear incredible to most people, and yet it is true, that many women do not know what the simplest things in our daily food are; cannot tell when water boils, or the difference between lamb and veal, lard and drippings. They cannot give the names of kitchen

utensils; do not know anything about a stove, or how to pare a potato. This will explain what might otherwise seem an unnecessary minuteness of detail. The experience of such ignorance also suggested the sub-title of the "Boston Cook Book,"--"What to do and what not to do in Cooking,"--just <emph rend="italic">how</emph> to hold your bowl and spoon, to use your hands, to regulate your stove, to wash your dishes; and just <emph rend="italic">how not</emph> to fall into the errors into which so many have stumbled before you. But, more than all, it is attempted to give a reason for every step taken, and a clear answer to any questions that are likely to arise in the experience of either housekeeper or cook.</p></div>

<hd align="center" size="larger">A PREFACE NOT FOR THE PUBLIC.</hd>
<p>A WORD of grateful acknowledgement is due the many friends who have aided in this work.</p><p>First, to my mother I owe much for her excellent judgment in training me as a child to a love for all household work. Although it was often hard to "help mother" when other children were at play, the knowledge thus gained has proved invaluable. Every year's experience in teaching has made me prize more and more this early training.</p><p>Also, I am deeply indebted to Miss M. S. DEVEREUX for the illustrations of this book. In all my work I have been greatly aided by her suggestions and generous sympathy.</p><p>And, lastly, I would not forget my obligations to a large circle of personal friends. Especially would I remember the one who, twenty years ago, aided me in making my first loaf of bread, and the many among my pupils who, out of their varied experience, have contributed much that has proved helpful.</p><p align="right">MARY J.

<chapter class1="foodandnonfood">
<hd align="center" size="larger">COOKERY</hd>
<p>COOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nourishment of the human body. When given its proper importance in the consideration of health and comfort, it must be based upon scientific principles of hygiene and what the French call the minor moralities of the household. All civilized nations cook their food, to improve its taste and digestibility. The degree of civilization is often measured by the cuisine.</p><p>Cooking (from the Latin <emph rend="italic">coquo,</emph> to boil, bake, heat, dry, scorch, or ripen) is usually done by the direct application of heat. Fruits and some vegetables which are eaten in a natural state have really been cooked or ripened by the heat of the sun. Milk and eggs, which are types of perfect food, would be useless as food unless they came from the warm living animal. Fish, flesh, and fruits which have been dried in the sun or smoked, and are often eaten without any further preparation, have undergone a certain process of natural cooking.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Heat</emph> seems to create new flavors, and to change the odor, taste, and digestibility of nearly all articles of food. It swells and bursts the starch cells in flour, rice, and potatoes; hardens the albumen in eggs, fish, and meat; softens the fibrous substances in tough meats, hard vegetables and fruits. It develops new flavors in tea, coffee, roasted meat, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc.</p>
 
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=22"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Cold</emph> is also an important matter to be regarded in the preparation of food. Sweet dishes and certain flavors, like honey, ices, and custards; the water, wine, or milk we drink; our butter, fruits, and salads,--are all more palatable when cold.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Water,</emph> or some other liquid, in connection with heat is necessary in many forms of cookery. Grains, peas, beans, dried fruits which have parted with nearly all their moisture in the ripening or drying process necessary for their preservation, need a large portion of water in cooking, to soften and swell the cellulose, gluten, and starch before they can be masticated and digested. In some vegetables and fruits water draws out certain undesirable flavors; it softens and dissolves the gelatinous portions of meat, and makes palatable and nourishing many substances which would be rendered unwholesome by a dry heat.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Air,</emph> or the free action of oxygen, upon our food while cooking develops certain flavors not otherwise to be obtained. Meat roasted or broiled has a much finer flavor than when boiled, baked, or fried. Toasted bread, thin corn cake baked before the fire, roasted apples, and many articles cooked in the open air, show the benefit of this free combined action of heat and air.</p><p>Drying in the sun was one of the earliest modes of cookery. Then came roasting before an open fire, or broiling over the coals, and baking in the hot ashes. This last was the primitive oven. As the art of making cooking-utensils developed, stewing, boiling, and frying were adopted. Then, to economize heat, portable ovens were invented; these were originally a covered dish set over or near the fire, having sometimes a double cover filled with coals. Afterwards, stoves which kept the fire and heat in a limited space were introduced; and improvements have been made in them so extensively that we now have them with conveniences for doing every form of cooking with wood, coal, oil, or gas.</p><p>Some one gives this distinction between man and other animals: "Man is an animal that builds a fire and uses it
 
<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=23"/>

to cook his food." It is quite important then, as a stepping-stone to cooking, to learn the properties and management of a fire.</p>
<section class1="generalnonfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fire.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Fire</emph> is heat and light produced by the combustion of inflammable substances. Combustion is a chemical operation carried on in the air, or the chemical union of the oxygen of the air with some combustible body, like hydrogen gas or the solid carbon, and is attended with the evolution of heat and light. The heat and the light come from the sun. With every particle of vegetable matter that is formed by the combined action of the sun and the carbonic acid gas in the air, a portion of the sun's heat and light is absorbed and held fast in it. And whenever this vegetable matter is decomposed,--as in burning wood, coal, or oil, which are only definite forms of vegetable matter,--this heat and light are given out. The amount of each depends upon the mode of burning.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Air</emph> is composed mainly of two elementary gases, oxygen and nitrogen (one part oxygen and four parts nitrogen), with a small amount of watery vapor and carbonic acid gas.</p><p>Pure oxygen is a gas which has a wonderful attraction for, and power of combination with, every other element. If it were everywhere present in a perfectly pure state, it would consume or burn up everything; but it is diluted or mixed (not combined) with nitrogen, another gas which is incombustible, and which lessens the combustibility of everything with which it comes in contact. Owing to this dilution, the oxygen will not unite with the carbon and hydrogen with which it is everywhere surrounded, and produce <emph rend="italic">rapid</emph> combustion, except at a high temperature. The temperature at which this union takes place is called the burning-point, and this varies in different substances. Thus combustion is within the power and control of man; and some extra means are usually employed to increase the temperature to the burning-point,--friction, or percussion, or the use of some more highly inflammable
 
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=24"/>

substances, like sulphur and phosphorus. This produces heat sufficient to complete the chemical union, or, in common phrase, "kindles the fire."</p><p>The heat generated for all household purposes is produced by the chemical action of the oxygen of the air upon the hydrogen and carbon which are found in the various kinds of wood and coal. The oxygen first combines with the carbon and decomposes it, producing carbonic acid gas, which escapes into the air, from which it is absorbed by plants, or by human lungs when there is no proper ventilation. The oxygen also combines with the hydrogen gas in the fuel, and this produces the flame; the larger the amount of hydrogen in the fuel, the greater the amount of flame. Some of the products of combustion are not entirely consumed, and pass off as smoke; some are incombustible, and remain as ashes. The intensity of a fire and the amount of heat which it produces are always in proportion to the amount of oxygen with which it is supplied. There should be just air enough for perfect combustion. An excess of air projected upon a fire conveys away the heat, cools the fuel, and checks the combustion. The supply of air should be controlled by confining it in a limited space.</p><p>Fires are usually kindled at the bottom of a flue or chimney. The heated air, being lighter, rises; the colder, denser air rushes in to take its place, becomes heated, and ascends. Thus a continuous current is established, and a constant supply of fresh air secured. The chimney serves to carry off the smoke and poisonous products of combustion; the heavier, incombustible products settle in the form of ashes. The force of this current of air drawing through the chimney (a matter of great importance) is called the draught. It varies with the temperature and amount of air in the room, and the length and width of the chimney.</p></section>
<section class1="generalnonfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fuel.</hd>
<p>The materials generally used as fuel are wood, charcoal, coal, kerosene oil, and gas.</p>
 
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=25"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Soft woods,</emph> such as pine or birch, kindle quickly, produce intense heat, and are best for a quick, blazing fire.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Hard woods,</emph> like oak, ash, and hickory, burn more slowly, but produce harder coals, which retain the heat longer, and are better where long-continued heat is required.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Charcoal,</emph> which is coal made by charring or burning wood with only a limited supply of air, burns easily and produces greater heat in proportion to its weight than any other fuel. It should never be burned in a close room.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Anthracite coal</emph> is a kind of mineral charcoal derived from ancient vegetation buried in the earth, and so thoroughly pressed that nothing is left but pure carbon, a little sulphur, and the incombustible ash. It kindles slowly, yields an intense, steady heat, and burns for a longer time without replenishing than the hardest wood.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Coke,</emph> often used in cities, is the residue of coal from which illuminating gas has been manufactured. The heat is intense, but transient.</p><p>Stoves for burning <emph rend="italic">kerosene oil</emph> and <emph rend="italic">gas</emph> have recently been introduced, and are now so nearly perfect that the care of a fire for cooking purposes is trifling. Gas can only be used in certain localities.</p><p>The cheapest fuel is the <emph rend="italic">best</emph> kerosene oil. There need be no waste, no superfluous heat, no vitiated air, if the fire be extinguished immediately after the work is done, and if the stove be kept perfectly clean, so as to secure a free burning and perfect combustion. With two good stoves having all the latest and best improvements, a large amount of work can be easily and satisfactorily accomplished.</p></section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Making and Care of a Coal Fire.</hd>
<p>If you intend to buy a new stove or range, get one simple in construction, that you may quickly learn all its parts and their uses; plain in finish, that you may easily keep it clean; and perfectly fitted part to part, with doors and dampers shutting absolutely close, so that you may control the fire and heat. This latter point is of essential
 
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=26"/>

importance in regulating the oven and in preventing a waste of fuel.</p><p>Become thoroughly acquainted with whatever stove you may have. If necessary, take it apart; learn how to clean it in the inside, to regulate the dampers for all the variations of wind, temperature, and fuel; and then learn how to make and keep a fire.</p><p>All stoves have a fire-box, with more or less space underneath for ashes; a slide damper under the fire, letting in the air; an outlet for the smoke; and a damper which regulates the supply of hot air, sending it around and underneath the oven, or letting it escape into the chimney. Remove the covers and brush the soot from the top of the oven into the fire-box; then clean out the grate; and if the stove have conveniences for so doing, sift the ashes in the stove and save all the old coal and cinders. Put in shavings or loose rolls of paper, then fine pine kindlings, arranged crosswise, and a layer of hard wood, leaving plenty of air space between the pieces. Be sure the wood comes out to each end of the fire-box. Put on the covers; and if the stove need cleaning, moisten some pulverized stove polish with water, and rub the stove with a paint brush dipped in the polish. When all blackened, rub with a dry polishing-brush until nearly dry. Open the direct draught and oven damper, and light the paper, as a slight heat facilitates the process of polishing. When the wood is thoroughly kindled, fill the fire-box with coal even with the top of the oven. Brush up the hearth and floor, empty the teakettle, and fill it with fresh water. Watch the fire, and push the coal down as the wood burns away, and add enough more coal to keep it even with the top of the fire bricks. When the blue flame becomes white, close the oven damper; and when the coal is burning freely, but not red, shut the direct draught. It seems impossible for some persons to understand that a coal fire is at its height as soon as well kindled, and needs only air enough to keep it burning. When it becomes bright red all through, it has parted with most of its heat, and begins to die out. Tons
 
<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=27"/>

of coal are wasted in many kitchens, and ranges are needlessly burned out, by filling the fire-box till the coal touches the covers, and leaving the draughts open till the coal is red.</p><p>Nearly all stoves and portable ranges have the oven at one side of and a little below the fire. In brick-set ranges the ovens are sometimes over the fire. A stove has a door on each side of the oven, with the fire-box in front. A portable range has only one oven-door, and the fire-box at the end. In ranges where the oven is over the fire, the articles to be baked are placed on a grate near the middle, as the bottom of the oven is usually very hot. In stoves or portable ranges anything which has to rise in the oven, like bread, pastry, cake, etc., is placed on the bottom of the oven, and, if the heat be too great, a small rack or grate may be placed under it. Large pieces of meat are placed on a rack in a pan; while small cuts of meat, birds, etc., which are to be baked quickly, and any dishes which are to be merely browned, like scalloped dishes, must be placed on the grate near the top. Cultivate the habit of opening and shutting the oven-door quickly but gently. Learn the hottest and coolest places in the oven. Look at things as they are baking, and turn and watch till you are sure they can be left alone. If anything bake unevenly or too fast, put a screen between it and the heat,--a pan on the grate above or underneath, or a frame of stiff paper made larger than the pan, that it may not touch the dough. When the regulating dampers are closed and the oven is still too hot, lift a cover on the top partly off, although in a stove in which the parts are perfectly adjusted this will never be necessary. When the oven is not hot enough, open the direct draught, and rake out the ashes from the grate. Keep the grate cleaned out and the fire burning freely, when a very hot oven is needed. At other times keep the draughts shut and do not waste the coal.</p><p>To keep a brisk fire for several hours or all day, it is better to add a sprinkling of coal often, rather than to let it burn nearly out, and then, by adding a larger quantity, 
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=28"/>

check the fire and retard the work. In using the top of the stove remember the hottest place is over the fire and toward the middle, <emph rend="italic">not</emph> on the front of the stove. When you have once watched the flame in its passage over the top, down the back, and under the oven, then across, out and up on the opposite side and out into the chimney, you will understand where the greatest heat must be.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Boiling.</hd>
<p>The term "boiling" is often used erroneously in cookery. The expressions "the teakettle boils," "the rice is boiling," "boiled beef," etc., are all good illustrations of the rhetorical figure <emph rend="italic">metonymy,</emph> but they are practically incorrect. In all cases it is only the water or liquid which boils. No solid can boil until first changed to a liquid. Solids become liquids at the melting-point. Liquids take the form of steam or vapor at the boiling-point. Boiling is the conversion of a liquid into steam by the application of heat sufficient to cause <emph rend="italic">ebullition,</emph> or agitation of its surface. Boiling, therefore, as applied to the cooking of solids, is heating or cooking in a boiling liquid. It is one of the most generally used, and abused, forms of cooking. Boiling water, which is really cooked water, is the liquid usually employed. Water, as it is heated from below, expands into vapor. The air of the water and the steam shoot up in the form of bubbles; as they come in contact with the cold water near the surface, the bubbles collapse, the steam is condensed and descends with the cold water, making a double set of currents, which causes quite a commotion among the particles. As the whole body of water becomes hotter, these bubbles of steam rise higher and higher before collapsing, and occasion the sound which we call the "singing of the kettle." When the water is sufficiently heated, they rise and break at the surface, causing more or less agitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water is scalding hot at 150&#176;, or when the hand cannot be borne in it. <emph rend="italic">Water
 
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=29"/>

simmers</emph> when the bubbles all collapse beneath the surface, and the steam is condensed to water again, or at 185&#176;. <emph rend="italic">Water boils</emph> when the bubbles rise to the surface, and the steam is thrown off, as at 212&#176;. When this boiling-point is reached, the heat escapes with the steam; and all the fire in the world cannot make the water any hotter, so long as the steam escapes. If the fire be very fierce, so that these bubbles are formed and expelled rapidly, and the water boils over, the water is no hotter; it only evaporates or boils away faster, and can only be made hotter by confining the steam, which in ordinary kettles is impossible, owing to the enormous expansive force of the steam. With a few exceptions it is a waste of fuel, time, and material to keep the water boiling at such a galloping rate that the cover has to be lifted to prevent boiling over.</p><p>A kettle should <emph rend="italic">never</emph> be quite full, as the water expands in heating, and, in boiling over, makes needless work and injures the stove. Water will boil more quickly in a kettle with a rough surface than in one with a smooth surface, as the water adheres to a smooth surface with greater force, and this force or attraction must be overcome before boiling takes place. Small, clean gravel is sometimes kept in a smooth kettle to facilitate the boiling.</p><p>Water boils at a higher temperature when there is sugar, or salt, or anything in it to increase its density. It takes longer for it to boil; but it is hotter, when that point is reached. No one who has been burned by boiling syrup ever doubted this fact. Fresh water boils at 212&#176;; salt water, at 224&#176;. If we put salt with the water in the lower part of a <implement>double boiler,</implement> a greater degree of heat is obtained by which to cook the articles in the top.</p><p>Water boils at a lower temperature, that is, more quickly, when the pressure of the air upon the water is diminished. Before a rain the pressure of the air is lessened, because the air when filled with vapor is lighter. Observing housekeepers have often noticed how quickly things burn at such a time, and foretell a rain by the rapidity with which water evaporates.</p>
 
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=30"/>

<p>The pressure of the air is less the higher we ascend above the level of the sea, since we leave much of the air below us. Cooking in boiling water requires a much longer time in mountainous regions; for the water boils so quickly that it holds less heat than in lower altitudes, where it is subject to greater pressure. Water, in boiling, loses the air or gases which give it a fresh taste and sparkling appearance. It becomes flat and tasteless. If there be any impurity in water, boiling or cooking will destroy it. Then, by cooling, and exposing to pure air again, it becomes aerated and palatable. But water for cooking, unless there are impurities to be removed, should be used when freshly boiled. This is especially important in making tea and coffee.</p><p>Soft water should be used in boiling where the object is to soften the texture, and extract the soluble parts, as in soups, broths, tea, and coffee. Hard water, or soft water salted, is better where we wish to preserve the articles whole, and retain the soluble and flavoring principles, as in most green vegetables. Beans or dried peas, which contain casein or vegetable albumen in large proportion, should be cooked in soft water, as the lime in hard water hardens the casein, and prevents the vegetables from becoming soft.</p><p>In cooking meat, fish, and vegetables in water, we should remember these two facts:--</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cold water</emph> draws out the albuminous juices, softens the fibres and gelatinous portions of meat, and holds them in solution. It draws out starch, but does not unite with it.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Boiling water</emph> hardens and toughens albumen and fibrine, bursts the starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling starch.</p><p>Meat is cooked in water for three distinct purposes:--</p><p><emph rend="italic">First.</emph> To keep the nutriment <emph rend="italic">within the meat,</emph> as in what is usually called <emph rend="italic">boiled meat.</emph> To do this, we leave the meat whole, that only a little surface may be exposed. Plunge it into boiling salted water, and keep it there for five or ten minutes; this hardens the albumen over the entire surface, and makes a coating through which the juices
 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=31"/>

cannot escape. Then move the kettle where the water will simmer slowly. See that the cover fits tightly, to keep in the steam. The water should be salted to raise the boiling-point, and increase the density of the water, and thus prevent the escape of the juices. A small amount of the albumen in the outer surface will be dissolved and rise as scum. This should be removed, or it will settle on the meat and render it uninviting in appearance. If the meat be put in the kettle with the bones uppermost, then the scum will not settle on the meat. In turning the meat do not pierce into it to let the juices escape. It will take a longer time to cook in this way, but the fibrine will be softened, and the meat made more tender and of better flavor, than when kept boiling furiously.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Second.</emph> Meats are cooked in water to have the nutriment <emph rend="italic">wholly in the liquid,</emph> as in <emph rend="italic">soups</emph> and <emph rend="italic">meat teas.</emph> Cut the meat in small pieces; soak in cold water, the longer the better; heat gradually, and keep hot, but not boiling, until all the goodness is extracted.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Third.</emph> Meats are cooked in water to have the nutriment <emph rend="italic">partly</emph> in the <emph rend="italic">liquid</emph> and <emph rend="italic">partly</emph> in the <emph rend="italic">meat,</emph> as in <emph rend="italic">stews, fricassees,</emph> etc. Put the meat in cold water, let the water boil quickly, then skim, and keep at the simmering-point. The cold water will draw out enough of the juices to enrich the liquid; then, as it reaches the boiling-point, the meat hardens, and retains the remainder.</p><p>Fish is usually cooked in boiling water for the purpose of keeping the juices in the fish. As the flesh of fish breaks easily, the water should never be allowed to boil rapidly. Salmon, mackerel, or any very oily fish, should be put into cold water, and brought almost to the boiling-point quickly, as they have a very strong, rich flavor. A little of this flavor can be lost without injury to the fish.</p><p>Vegetables, which are mostly starch and water, should be put into boiling water and boiled rapidly, that the small portions of albumen which they contain may be hardened on the surface; then, if the starch grains are burst quickly, they will absorb the albuminous juices within.</p>
 
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=32"/>

<p>Milk boils at 196&#176;. Being thicker than water, less of the steam escapes, and the whole liquid becomes hot sooner than water. The bubbles rise rapidly, and, owing to their tenacity, do not burst at the surface, but climb over one another till they run over the edge of the pan.</p><p>Milk, grains, custards, and any substances which, from their glutinous nature, would be liable to adhere to the kettle, are much more easily and safely cooked in a <implement>double boiler,</implement> or in a pail within a kettle of water. This is one form of <emph rend="italic">steaming,</emph> or cooking over boiling water. In steaming, the water should not stop boiling until the articles are cooked. This is a convenient form of cooking many articles which it is troublesome to cook with a dry heat, and yet do not need the solvent powers of water. Watery vegetables are rendered drier by steaming; and tough pieces of meat which cannot be roasted, are first made tender by steaming, and then browned in the oven. Sometimes meat is steamed in its own juices alone; this is called <emph rend="italic">smothering,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">pot-roasting.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Stewing</emph> is another form of boiling or cooking in a small quantity of water, at a moderate heat, and for a long time. The word means a slow, moist, gentle heat. It is an economical mode of cooking, except where a fire has to be kept for this purpose alone. The long-continued action of a gentle heat softens the fibres; and the coarsest and cheapest kinds of meat, cooked in this way, with vegetables, may be made tender and nutritious. By judicious use of seasoning material, remnants can be made into savory and nourishing dishes. Whether we call it simply a <emph rend="italic">stew,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">ragout, haricot,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">salmi,</emph> the principle is the same,--that of slow, steady simmering, rather than fierce boiling.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fricasseeing</emph> (meaning "to fry") is a form of stewing. The term is usually applied to chicken, veal, or some small game, which is cut into pieces, and fried either before or after stewing, and served with a rich white or brown sauce, and without vegetables. Any meat that is quite juicy and not very tough may be first browned on the outside to keep in the juices, and improve the flavor. Coarse,
 
<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=33"/>

tough pieces should not be browned, but dipped in vinegar to soften the fibre; and pieces containing much gristle should be put into cold water.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Braising</emph> is a form of stewing done usually in a <implement>braising-pan</implement> or kettle which has coals in the cover. Any granite or <implement>iron pan</implement> with a close cover to keep in the steam will answer the purpose. When placed in the oven, where it is surrounded by a slow, uniform heat, it needs very little attention. It is one of the most economical and satisfactory ways of cooking large pieces of tough, lean meat, pigeons, liver, fowls, heart, etc. Stock, vegetables, and bacon may be used, if a rich liquor be required; but water, herbs, and simple seasoning make it very palatable.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Baking</emph> is hardening or cooking in a dry heat, as in a close oven. Nearly all flour mixtures--bread, pastry, and some forms of pudding--are more wholesome baked than when cooked in any other way. Many forms of baking are really stewing; but the closely confined heat of the oven gives an entirely different flavor from that obtained by stewing over the fire. This is seen in the difference between stewed and baked apple-sauce, beans, etc.</p><p>Meat and fish, if baked in the right way, lose less in weight than when boiled or roasted. To bake them properly, the juices must be kept within the meat. An intense heat at first is necessary to harden the albumen; then reduce the heat, that the outside may not become too hard, and baste frequently to prevent drying. No water should be put in the pan at first, as it will then be impossible to have a greater heat than that of boiling water (212&#176;), while for baking meat 280&#176;, or more, is required. Put one or two tablespoonfuls of beef drippings, or some of the fat from the meat, in the pan, to use in basting, as the fat can be made much hotter than water. If the joint be very large, or the meat need thorough cooking, like poultry, veal, or pork, water can be added to check the heat as soon as the outside is cooked sufficiently to keep in the juices. This will keep the meat moist. Small cuts, and meats to be eaten rare, are better baked without water.</p>
 
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=34"/>

<p>Many persons accustomed to meat roasted before the open fire object to the flavor of baked meat. If the oven be very hot at first, and opened every five minutes just long enough for the basting, which is an essential part of the cooking process, the smoky odor escapes. If there be no damper to check the heat underneath the oven, put the grate or another pan under the <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> as no heat is required under the meat. This will prevent the fat in the pan from burning and smoking the meat. Place the meat with the skin side down at first; then, if the juices begin to flow, the skin keeps them in; and, when turned, it brings the side which is to be up in serving next the hottest part of the oven, for the final browning. All baked meat or fish should be salted and floured all over. Salt draws out the juices; but the flour unites with them, making a paste which soon hardens, and keeps them within. Baste often, and dredge with salt and flour <emph rend="italic">after</emph> basting. If there be no shelf attached to the stove near the oven, keep a box or frame of wood just the height of the oven, near by, and pushed up close to it; it will be found very convenient to pull the pan out upon it when basting or turning the meat.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Frying.</hd>
<p>Frying is cooking in hot fat,--<emph rend="italic">not boiling</emph> fat, as it is so often called, for fat can be made much hotter than the temperature required for cooking, which is 385&#176;; the temperature for boiling fat is from 565&#176; to 600&#176;. Frying, when properly done, is <emph rend="italic">immersion</emph> in smoking-hot fat. The fat should be <emph rend="italic">deep</emph> enough to entirely cover the articles to be cooked; and as it may be used many times, it is not so extravagant as some suppose to use such a quantity. The prime secret of nice frying is to have the fat hot enough to harden instantly the albumen on the outer surface, and thus prevent the fat from soaking into the inside of whatever is to be fried. As a much higher temperature is required than that for boiling or baking, the articles are
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=35"/>

very quickly cooked; and they have a flavor quite unlike that given by any other form of cooking.</p><p>All articles to be fried should be thoroughly dried and slightly warmed. If very <emph rend="italic">moist,</emph> or very <emph rend="italic">cold,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">too many</emph> articles be fried at the same time, the fat becomes chilled, and the grease soaks into them. Then, as the moisture heats and boils, it causes such a commotion that the fat and water boil over, and there is great danger from the fat taking fire and spreading to your clothing, to say nothing of the trouble of cleaning the stove and floor. For this reason be careful not to let a drop of water, or of condensed steam from another kettle, fall into the hot fat.</p><p>Meat, fish, oysters, croquettes, etc., should be dried, and rolled in fine bread-crumbs, to absorb any moisture; then rolled in beaten egg, and in fine crumbs again. The hot fat hardens the albumen of the egg instantly; and that, with the crumbs, makes a fat-proof crust.</p><p>Fish balls, fritters, and fried muffin mixtures contain egg and albumen sufficient to keep them from soaking fat, if the fat be only hot enough. A <implement>Scotch bowl,</implement> or deep iron or granite kettle, and a wire basket small enough to fit down into the kettle, are best to use in frying.</p><p><emph rend="italic">The Test for Hot Fat.</emph>--When the fat begins to smoke put in a bit of bread; if it brown quickly, or while you can count sixty as the clock ticks, it is hot enough for fried potatoes, doughnuts, etc. When hot enough to brown the bread while you count forty, it will do for fish balls, croquettes, etc.</p><p>When ready to fry, plunge the basket into the hot fat to grease it, and then place in it the croquettes, or whatever you may be frying, so that they will not touch each other. Hold the handle of the basket with a long fork, and plunge it quickly into the fat, but do not drop the handle, because if the fat begin to boil up, you can then raise the basket quickly, and wait till the ebullition has subsided before plunging it in again; and thus avoid the danger of burning from the overflowing fat. The fat cools rapidly, when many articles are fried at once, and
 
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=36"/>

should be reheated to the test point before frying any more.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Time.</emph>--Any cooked mixture, such as fish balls and croquettes, or very small fish, oysters, scallops, etc., will be fried brown in one minute. Thicker fish, chops, and fritters require longer cooking; and, after plunging them into the hot fat, the kettle should be set back from the fire to prevent them from becoming too brown before they are sufficiently cooked. While frying, be careful not to spill any fat on the stove. Keep a tin plate in your left hand, and hold it under the basket, or ladle, as you take things from the fat.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Draining.</emph>--Thorough draining is another secret of nice frying, and you cannot find a much hotter place than right over the hot fat; so hold your basket of fried food over the hot fat, and shake slightly, till all dripping has stopped. Then place the fried articles on soft or unglazed paper, to absorb the fat, and keep them hot till ready to serve. Never pile fried articles one on another.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fat for Frying.</hd>
<p>Lard, a mixture of half suet and half lard, drippings, or oil, may be used for frying. Suet and drippings are cheapest, and are preferred by many. Suet used alone cools very quickly and leaves a tallowy taste. Drippings should be carefully clarified (see <ref target="linc038.jpg">page 18</ref>) and freed from water, or the articles cooked will soak fat. Lard, with a small proportion of suet or drippings, is more generally satisfactory. There is often a very disagreeable odor to new lard, and more or less water in it, as is shown by the froth and ebullition as soon as it becomes hot. Before it is used for any purpose it should be clarified with slices of raw potato and heated until it becomes still. Olive oil is the purest fat for frying, but it is too expensive for general use. Cottonseed oil has been recently introduced for cooking purposes, and is an excellent fat for frying, though many dislike its peculiar odor. It may be heated much hotter than lard,
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=37"/>

without burning, and, when properly used, imparts no flavor to the food. When the fat becomes too brown for potatoes or doughnuts, use it for croquettes, etc., and then use it for nothing except fish balls and fish. When it becomes very brown, put it with the soap-grease.</p><p>If you wish to fry several kinds at the same time, begin with potatoes, following with doughnuts or flour mixtures, and crumbed articles last; otherwise the crumbs will fall off; and adhere to whatever is put in subsequently. After every frying, strain the fat through a fine wire strainer or fine <implement>strainer cloth</implement> into a tin pail, not pouring it, but dipping it from the kettle with a small long-handled dipper. Let it cool slightly before straining as, if very hot, it will melt the strainer. Sprinkle coffee on the stove, while frying, to disguise the odor.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Saut&#233;ing.</hd>
<p>The ordinary way of frying in a shallow pan with only a little fat, first on one side and then on the other, which the French call <emph rend="italic">saut&#233;ing,</emph> answers very well for some purposes,--omelets, fried cakes, and many things browned in butter; but nearly everything that requires any more fat than just enough to keep it from sticking, is much better <emph rend="italic">immersed</emph> in hot fat. Fish balls, chops, and oysters are more quickly cooked, and absorb less fat, when fried by immersion than when <emph rend="italic">saut&#233;d.</emph> Some people are extremely unwilling to make the change, and persist in going on in the old way of cooking in a little, half-hot fat which spatters over stove and floor, soaks into the fish or meat, and is often served as the only gravy. Upon such, dyspepsia is a fell avenger.</p><p>These directions for frying are given thus minutely not from any desire to recommend this method of cooking; but, if people <emph rend="italic">will</emph> fry their food, they should do it in the only correct way. With the exception of salt-fish balls and small, dry, white fish, there is nothing fried, even in 
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=38"/>

the right way, that would not be equally good, and much more conducive to health, were it cooked otherwise. Saratoga potatoes, or chips as they are called, are really chips, for persons with weak digestion. Oysters, chops, fritters, and the materials in croquettes, muffins, and doughnuts may be cooked in many better ways.</p><p>Frying answers very well for open-air cooking, on the seashore or in camp, where appetite and digestion are strengthened. But in most modern houses, where the odors from the kitchen penetrate the remotest nook and corner, there are many serious objections, apart from the indigestibility of the food thus prepared. The acrid odors given off during the heating of fat are very irritating to the mucous membrane of the nose and throat, and they are equally so to a sensitive stomach. Some persons who can usually digest fried food cannot do so when the stomach has been irritated by the odor in frying. If all those who are so fond of croquettes, fritters, etc., were obliged to inhale the smoking fat, these dishes would seldom appear on the table.</p></section>
<section class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">To clarify Fat.</hd>
<p>Any uncooked fat, such as suet, the fat from chickens, and all superfluous beef fat, should be saved and clarified, or made pure and clear. Cut the fat into small pieces, cover with cold water, and cook over a slow fire until the fat has melted, and the water nearly all evaporated. Then strain and press all the fat from the scraps. When cool, remove the cake of hard fat, or, if soft, draw it to one side and let the water underneath run off. You may put with the new fat any fat from soup stock, corned beef, drippings from roast beef, veal, fresh pork, or chicken; in fact, anything except the fat from mutton, turkey, and smoked meat. If there be any sediment adhering to the fat, add a little very cold water, and, after stirring well, pour the water off, or skim the fat from the water. Place the fat in a pan over the fire, and, when melted, add one small raw potato, cut into thin slices. Let it stand on the top
 
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=39"/>

of the stove or in the oven till the fat has stopped bubbling, is still, and the scraps are brown and crisp and rise to the top. Strain through a fine strainer, and keep in a cool place. Fat thus cleared will keep sweet for weeks, if melted occasionally, which should always be done when any new fat is added.</p><p>Boiling the fat causes the water in it to evaporate, and the organic matters or impurities to be decomposed, and deposited as sediment; the potato, owing to its porosity and power of absorption (being mostly starch and carbon), absorbs any odors or gases, unites with the sediment, and thus cleanses the fat, very much as charcoal purifies water. Clarified fat (or dripping, as it is usually termed) answers for many purposes in cooking,--frying, saut&#233;ing, basting roast meat, greasing pans; and as shortening for bread, plain pastry, and gingerbread.</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Egg and Bread Crumbing.</hd>
<p>Hints on saving bread crusts and stale pieces, for egg and bread crumbing, are given on <ref target="linc095.jpg">page 75.</ref> The crumbs should be sifted through a fine sieve. For fish or meat mix a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley with them. Beat the eggs slightly with a fork in a shallow dish. Add one tablespoonful of water or two tablespoonfuls of milk for each egg. Add a little sugar if they are to be used for sweet dishes, and salt and pepper for all others. Sprinkle the crumbs on a board, and roll the chop, fish, or croquettes first in the crumbs; shake off all that do <emph rend="italic">not</emph> adhere. Cover all the articles with the crumbs and let them stand till dry, then dip into the beaten egg, and be careful to have every part covered. Drain from the egg, and roll again in the crumbs. Croquettes or any soft mixture should be held on a broad knife while being placed in the egg. Then dip the egg over them, and slip the knife again lengthwise under the croquette, drain, and put it carefully into the crumbs. Scallops and very small oysters can be more easily crumbed by placing them with the crumbs in a 
 
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=40"/>

sheet of paper, and tossing or turning till all are crumbed. Remember the order: crumbs first, then egg, then crumbs again.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Roasting.</hd>
<p>Roasting (meaning "to heat violently") is cooking before an open fire; it implies the action of a much greater degree of heat than that employed in any of the previously specified methods of cooking. The heat of an open fire is about 1,000&#176;.</p><p>In the days of open fireplaces this was the general way of cooking large pieces of meat; but now it is adopted only in large establishments, or by those who can afford the additional expense of a <implement>tin kitchen,</implement> and a range constructed especially for roasting. Baking, or roasting in a very hot oven, being a cheaper and more convenient way, is more generally used. Ovens in stoves and ranges are now well ventilated; and meat when properly cooked in a very hot oven, and basted often, is nearly equal in flavor to that roasted before an open fire. The fire for roasting should be clear and bright, and of sufficient body to last, with only a slight sprinkling of coal, through the time for roasting.</p><p>The meat is placed on a spit, and hung in the jack in a <implement>tin kitchen,</implement> and made to revolve slowly before the fire by winding a spring in the jack, or by turning the spit at regular intervals. The meat should be rubbed with salt and flour, and placed on the spit, very near the fire at first, to harden the albumen; then removed a little distance to prevent the meat from burning, before the inside is cooked. Place two or three spoonfuls of dripping in the pan to use in basting the meat; baste often, and dredge two or three times with flour. When the joint is very large, place a buttered paper over it.</p><p>As the juices of meat are composed largely of water, the water will be evaporated as soon as it reaches the boiling-point, or 212&#176;. When meat is placed in a moderate oven, the heat is not sufficient to harden the albumen
 
<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=41"/>

on the outer surface; the watery juices evaporate, the steam escapes, and the meat becomes dry and tasteless. But when meat is exposed to the intense heat of an open fire, or a very hot oven, the albumen hardens; and if basted frequently with hot fat, the meat is completely enveloped in a varnish of hot melted fat, which assists in communicating the heat to the inside, and checks the evaporation of the juices; this prevents the escape of the steam, so that the inside of properly roasted meat is really cooked in the steam of its own juices. The evaporation of juices is proportionate to the amount of surface exposed. A small joint has a larger surface in proportion to its weight than a large joint weighing double or treble the amount; therefore the <emph rend="italic">smaller</emph> the <emph rend="italic">joint</emph> to be roasted, the <emph rend="italic">higher</emph> the <emph rend="italic">temperature</emph> to which its surface should be exposed, that the evaporation may be more quickly arrested.</p><p>For very thin pieces of meat, which have a still larger surface in proportion to the weight, such as steaks and chops, a greater heat is required. This is accomplished by <emph rend="italic">broiling,</emph> which should be done near the burning-point, the highest degree of heat employed in any form of cooking.</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Broiling.</hd>
<p>Broiling (meaning "to burn") is cooking directly over the hot coals. The degree of heat is so intense that the articles to be cooked would be very quickly burned, were they allowed to remain for any length of time over the fire. The secret of nice broiling is <emph rend="italic">frequent turning.</emph> The fire should be bright red, and nearly to the top of the fire-box, so that the <implement>broiler</implement> may almost touch the fire. There should be no flame, as the flame from coal is due to the combustion of tarry vapors, and will cause a deposit of coal tar on the meat, giving it a smoky, nauseating flavor. When the fat from the chop or steak drips on the coals and blazes, it deposits a film of mutton or beef fat all over the meat, which has a very different flavor from that of the coal flame. When the steak has much fat, remove
 
<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=42"/>

part of it. A little fat will improve the flavor, baste the meat, and keep it from becoming too dry. The oven damper should always be opened while broiling, that the smoke of the dripping fat may be carried into the chimney.</p><p>There is nothing better for broiling than a <implement>double wire broiler.</implement> It is well to have several sizes. Grease it well with a bit of the fat from the meat, or with salt pork rind. Place the thickest part of whatever is to be broiled next the middle of the <implement>broiler.</implement> Do not salt the meat, as salt draws out the juice. Have the platter heating, and everything else ready, that you may not leave the broiling for an instant. Hold the <implement>broiler</implement> firmly, with a coarse towel wrapped around your hand to protect it from the heat. Place it as near the fire as possible, to sear the outside instantly; count ten, then sear the other side. The heat hardens the outside, and starts the flow of the juices. They cannot escape through the hardened outer surface; but if the meat were cooked wholly on one side before turning, they would soon come to the top, and then, in turning the meat, the juices would drip into the fire. But if the meat be turned <emph rend="italic">before</emph> the juices reach the top, the other surface is hardened, and they cannot escape, but flow to the centre, and are there retained. As the juices are converted into steam by the heat, they swell and give the meat a puffy appearance. If the broiling be carried on too long, these juices gradually ooze between the fibres to the surface, and are evaporated; and the meat becomes dry, leathery, and indigestible.</p><p>Meat should be broiled only long enough to loosen all the fibres, and start the flow of the juices. The meat will spring up instantly when pressed with the knife; and when it ceases to do this, the juices have begun to evaporate, and the meat shrinks. A little experience will enable one to decide just when to remove the meat. Do not cut into it, as this lets out the juices. It should be pink and juicy, not raw and purple, nor brown and dry. Turn over as often as you can count ten, and cook four minutes, if
 
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=43"/>

one inch thick; six, if one inch and a half thick. The smaller and thinner the article, the hotter should be the fire; the larger the article, the more temperate the fire, or the greater the distance from the fire.</p><p>Fish should be floured to keep the skin from sticking. A large <implement>baking-pan</implement> to keep in the heat should be held over anything which is very thick and requires to be cooked a long time.</p><p>Chickens, which need to be thoroughly broiled but not burned or dried, require about twenty minutes. A safe way is to wrap them in buttered glazed paper; cook the inner side first, and after the first searing keep them at a little distance from the fire.</p><p>Chops, bacon, birds, and dry fish are also improved by broiling in the buttered paper. Take a large sheet of white letter paper, or two small sheets. Rub them well with softened butter. This keeps out the air. Season the chop or fish with salt and pepper, place it near the centre of the paper, and fold the edges of the paper over several times and pinch them together close to the meat. The paper will char a long time before blazing, if care be taken not to break through the paper and thus let in the air and let out all the fat. The meat will be basted with its own fat and juices. A longer time will be required for the broiling; but when the paper is well browned, the chop will be done. It will be found juicy and delicious,--free from any smoky flavor.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Pan-broiling</emph> is broiling in a hissing hot <implement>spider</implement> or frying-pan. Heat the pan to a blue heat. Rub it with a bit of the beef fat, just enough to keep the meat from sticking, but do not leave any fat in the pan. Sear the meat quickly on one side, then turn without cutting into the meat, and brown the other side before any juice escapes into the pan. Cook about four minutes, turning twice, and serve very hot with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> If the pan be hot enough and no fat used, this is <emph rend="italic">not</emph> frying, it is <emph rend="italic">broiling</emph> on <emph rend="italic">hot iron;</emph> and the flavor is almost equal to broiling over the coals.</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Larding.</hd>
<p>Many kinds of meat which are very lean and dry are improved by the addition of some kind of fat. The tenderloin or fillet of beef, the thick part of the leg of veal, grouse, and liver, are often prepared in this way.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Larding</emph> is drawing small strips of fat salt pork or bacon through the surface of the meat; <emph rend="italic">daubing</emph> is forcing strips of pork through the entire thickness of the meat. Take a piece of fat salt pork two inches wide and four inches long. Shave off the rind the long way of the pork; then cut two or three slices about a quarter of an inch thick, the same way as the rind; cut only to the membrane which lies about an inch below the rind, as this is the firmest part of the pork; then cut each slice across the width, into strips one quarter of an inch thick. This will make the lardoons one quarter of an inch wide and thick and two inches long. Insert one end of the lardoon into the end of the <implement>larding-needle,</implement> then with the point of the needle take up a stitch half an inch deep and one inch wide in the surface of the meat. Draw the needle through, and help the pork to go through by pushing until partly through, then hold the end of the pork and draw the needle out, leaving the pork in the meat, with the ends projecting at equal lengths. Take up more stitches one inch apart in parallel or alternate rows, until the whole surface is covered.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Daubing</emph> is applied to a broad, thick piece of beef or veal. Cut the pork in strips one third of an inch wide and thick, and as long as the meat is thick. Punch a hole clear through the meat with a steel, and then insert the
 
<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=46"/>

lardoon with a large <implement>larding-needle</implement> or with the fingers. The salt and fat from the lardoons penetrate the inside of the meat, and by many are considered an improvement. Those who object to the pork will find that beef may be seasoned as well by covering the surface with nice beef suet, salted; or the pork may be laid on the meat and removed after cooking. The process is not difficult, requiring no more skill than any other kind of sewing.</p></section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Boning.</hd>
<p>Any one who can use a sharp knife, and scrape meat or fish from a bone, without cutting her own flesh, can bone anything, from the smallest bird, chop, or fish, to a leg or forequarter of lamb, or a turkey. A small knife with a sharp, short, pointed blade, is all that is required. It is well to begin on a small scale by removing the bone from a chop or steak. The aim is to remove the flesh from the bone without cutting into the flesh, or destroying its shape more than is necessary.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Bone a Chop or Steak.</emph>--Begin at the bone end, scrape the meat away, leaving the bone clean and the flesh unbroken. If there be a piece of tenderloin under the bone, remove it, and put it up close to the meat, which was above the bone in the original form.</p><p>Directions for boning fish are given on <ref target="linc181.jpg">page 161.</ref></p><p><emph rend="italic">To Bone a Leg of Mutton.</emph>--Cut it off at the first joint, insert the knife near the joint, and loosen the flesh from the bone, leaving all the gristle and tendons on the bone. Then begin at the tail end, and scrape the fat away from the backbone, then follow the bone (you can easily tell by the feeling, if you cannot see it) until you come to the joint; leave all the gristle and cords on the bone, and continue scraping off the flesh till the whole bone is out. One could easily cut through from the outside to the bone and remove it in that way; but the flesh would have to be sewed together, and much of the juice would escape. After removing the bone, stuff the cavity left by the bone,
 
<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=47"/>

and sew the skin together at the smaller end. Then bring the edges together at the upper end, crowding all the flesh inside, and sew the skin together tightly. This gives a rectangular form of solid meat and stuffing. When salted and floured and exposed to a hot oven, the juices are kept inside; the meat is more conveniently served, and, when cold, does not become dry and hard.</p><p>Any other pieces of meat are boned in a similar manner.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Bone a Bird, Fowl, or Turkey.</emph>--In this case the flesh is to be kept in the skin in order to preserve the shape. The skin should be firm and unbroken, and the bird should not be drawn. Remove the head and pin-feathers, singe and wipe carefully. Remove the tendons from the legs, and loosen the skin round the end of the drumstick. Make an incision through the skin from the neck to the middle of the back, or near the junction of the side bone. Scrape the flesh with the skin away from the backbone until you feel the end of the shoulder-blade; loosen the flesh from this, and then follow the bone to the wing joint, and down to the middle joint in the wing. The skin lies very near the bone underneath the joint, and care must be taken to avoid cutting through the skin at these places. Leave the first bone in the wing to aid in keeping the shape; it may be removed before serving. In small birds there is so little meat on the wings, that it is just as well to cut them off at the middle joint. Remove the bone from the other wing in the same way, then follow the collar bone from the wing down to the breastbone, loosening the crop from the flesh. In removing the flesh from the breastbone, be careful not to cut through the skin on the ridge. The flesh may be pushed away with the fingers, and the fillets or pieces that are detached from the other flesh can be laid aside, and put in place afterwards. When the breastbone is bare, separate the flesh from the ribs, and be careful not to break through the membrane into the inside. Remove the flesh round the second joint, then the drumsticks, turning the flesh wrong side out as in pulling a glove from the finger.
 
<pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=48"/>

Repeat this process on the other side. Then scrape down to the end of the backbone, and cut through the bone, leaving a part of it in the tail. Separate the membrane under the body without breaking. Thus you have the flesh in the skin, and the skeleton left entire with the contents undisturbed in the inside. Lay the stuffing in, filling out the legs and wings, then sew the skin along the back, and skewer or tie into the original shape.</p><p>An easier way of boning a fowl where it is to be rolled like a <emph rend="italic">galantine,</emph> is to cut off the wings at the second joint, break the drumstick half-way from the joint, cut the skin down the entire length of the back, remove the flesh from the wing and second joint, turning the skin and flesh off like a glove; then do the same on the other wing and leg, leaving the breast till the last. The wings and legs are turned inside, the stuffing is laid in the flesh, and the whole rolled over and over, and sewed on the edge of the skin and at the ends of the roll.</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Measuring.</hd>
<p>It has been said that "good cooks never measure anything." They do. They measure by judgement and experience; and until <emph rend="italic">you</emph> have a large share of both these essential qualities, use your spoon and cup or scales.</p><p>Measures, in preference to weights, are used in nearly all these receipts, as they are more convenient for the majority of housekeepers. When measured and estimated by the Table of Weights and Measures on page 30, the cup and spoon may be used as accurately as the scales.</p><p>Flour, meal, sugar, salt, spices, and soda should always be sifted before measuring. Any other materials that have been packed, like mustard and baking powder, if not sifted, should be stirred, and broken up lightly. One tablespoonful of solid mustard taken carelessly from the box has been found equal to three tablespoonfuls measured after sifting.</p><p>The saltspoons, teaspoons, and tablespoons used in these receipts are the silver spoons now in general use. Iron

mixing-spoons vary much in size, but there is a size which holds exactly the same as a silver tablespoon. Be careful to use this size in measuring. The cup is the common <implement>kitchen cup</implement> holding half a pint. Those with handles are more convenient.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To measure a teaspoonful</emph> of dry material, dip into the sifted material, and take up a heaping spoonful, shake it slightly until it is just rounded over, or convex in the same proportion as the spoon is concave. <emph rend="italic">An even</emph> or <emph rend="italic">scant teaspoonful</emph> means the spoon filled lightly, and levelled off with a knife. <emph rend="italic">One half teaspoonful</emph> is most accurately measured by dividing through the middle lengthwise. When divided across the width the tip is smaller than the lower half. <emph rend="italic">A heaping teaspoonful</emph> is all the spoon will hold of any lightly sifted material. <emph rend="italic">A teaspoonful of liquid</emph> is the spoon full to the brim.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Tablespoonfuls</emph> are measured in the same way.</p><p><emph rend="italic">A cupful</emph> of dry material should be filled and heaped lightly (not shaken down), then levelled off even with the top. A small scoop should be kept in the flour or sugar to use in filling the cup. <emph rend="italic">A heaping cupful</emph> is all the cup will hold. <emph rend="italic">A cupful of liquid</emph> is <emph rend="italic">not</emph> what you can carry without spilling, but what the cup will hold without running over; full to the brim. Place your cup in a saucer, while filling it, or in the bowl in which the liquid is to be poured. <emph rend="italic">Half a cupful</emph> is <emph rend="italic">not</emph> half the distance from the bottom to the rim. Most cups are smaller at the bottom, for which allowance must be made. Take two cups of the same size and shape, fill one with water, then pour the water without spilling into the other cup until it stands at the same level in both cups. This gives you the half-cupful exactly, which in the cups used here is two thirds of the height, or within an inch of the top. The <emph rend="italic">quarter</emph> and <emph rend="italic">three-quarter</emph> measures may be found in the same way. A <emph rend="italic">scant cupful</emph> is within a quarter of an inch of the top.</p><p>"<emph rend="italic">Butter the size of an egg,</emph>" is a very common expression. This equals about one quarter of a cupful, or two ounces, or one <emph rend="italic">heaping</emph> tablespoonful, either of which is more easily

written than the first expression. Place an egg in one tablespoon, then pack butter in another till it fills the spoon in the same proportion as the egg, and you will easily carry it in mind.</p><p>Have your materials measured or at hand, and all utensils ready before beginning the mixing, or putting the ingredients together. Keep a bucket or pan full of flour, freshly sifted each day, and ready for use. Measure flour first, and put it in a bowl or pan together with salt, soda, cream of tartar, and spice; measure butter and put it in the mixing-bowl; then measure the sugar, and, in scraping out the sugar, take the butter which has adhered to the cup. Break your eggs on the edge of the cup; if the white be clear, the egg is good. Put the yolks in one bowl and the whites in another; measure the milk or liquid, and, after using the beaten yolk, clean out the bowl with the milk. Or, measure all the dry ingredients, break and separate the eggs, measure the milk, add it to the beaten yolks, and measure the melted butter last. In either way you can make one cup do for all without washing. "Two eggs beaten separately" means that the yolks and whites are to be beaten separately, not each whole egg beaten separately.</p><p>A tablespoonful of <emph rend="italic">melted butter</emph> is measured <emph rend="italic">after</emph> melting. A tablespoonful of <emph rend="italic">butter melted</emph> is measured <emph rend="italic">before</emph> melting.</p><p>To economize space, in many of the receipts the abbreviations are written; one cup for one cupful, tablesp. for tablespoonful, teasp. for teaspoonful, and saltsp. for saltspoonful. All these measures mean a full measure, unless scant or heaping measures are specified.</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Mixing.</hd>
<p>Next to care in measuring comes the manner of mixing. The most accurate measurement of the best materials is often rendered useless by a neglect to put them together properly, and the blame is usually charged to the oven or the receipt. There are three distinct ways of mixing: <emph rend="bold">Stirring, Beating,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Cutting</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Folding.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Stirring.</emph>--Let the bowl of the spoon rest slightly on the bottom of the mixing-bowl; then move round and round in widening circles, without lifting the spoon out of
 
<pb n="33" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=53"/>

the mixture, except to scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. Stir slowly at first, to avoid spattering; add the liquid gradually, and be sure the bowl of the spoon (not the edge nor the tip merely) touches the bottom and sides of the bowl. This is mashing as well as stirring, and the mixture soon becomes a paste. When perfectly smooth and free from lumps, add more liquid till you have the desired consistency. We <emph rend="italic">stir</emph> flour and water together for a thickening, or butter and flour and milk for a sauce. We <emph rend="italic">stir</emph> when we rub butter to a cream, or when we make a batter or semi-dough. When we make a stiff dough we stir at first, and then turn the whole mass over, bringing the knife or spoon round the bowl and cutting up through the dough.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Beating.</emph>--Tip the bowl slightly, and hold the spoon so that the edge scrapes the bowl, and bring it up through the mixture and over with a long quick flop to the opposite side; under, and up through again, lifting the spoon out of the mass and cutting clear through, scraping from the bottom at every stroke. Keep the bowl of the spoon and the sides of the mixing-bowl well scraped out, that all the material may be equally beaten.</p><p>We <emph rend="italic">stir</emph> simply to blend two or more materials; we <emph rend="italic">beat</emph> to entangle all the air possible in the mixture. We beat eggs or batter or soft dough. The albumen of the eggs and the gluten of the flour, owing to their viscidity or glutinous properties, catch the air and hold it in the form of cells, something as we make soap bubbles by blowing air into soapy water. The faster we beat, and the more we bring the material up from the bowl into the air, the more bubbles we have; but one stirring motion will destroy them. Yolks of eggs should be beaten nearly as much as the whites, or till they are light or lemon-colored, and thicken perceptibly. The whites should be beaten till they are stiff and dry, or fly off in flakes, or can be turned upside down without spilling. When the two are to be put together, always plan to turn the whites into the yolks, as there is less waste than when the yolks are turned into
 
<pb n="34" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=54"/>

the whites. Let the whites stand a minute, then run a <implement>palette knife</implement> round the edge close to the bowl; they will slip out easily, and leave the bowl almost clean. For beating eggs, for nearly all purposes the <implement>Dover egg-beater</implement> is the best. There should be two sizes, the larger one for the whites of eggs. Hold the beater lightly in the left hand, and move it round through the egg while turning the handle. For frosting, and snow pudding, and all beating of soft dough, use a <implement>perforated wooden spoon.</implement> Bowls with slightly flaring sides, and not too deep to be clasped from bottom to rim in the left hand, are most convenient. If tipped slightly toward the right, the beating is done more effectually.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cutting, or Folding, or Lifting.</emph>--Omelets, sponge cake, whipped cream, etc., should have the beaten white cut or folded in carefully to avoid breaking the air bubbles. Turn the mixture over with the spoon, cut through, lift up, and fold the materials together, lifting the part from below, up and over, and mixing very gently until just blended. Do not stir round and round, nor beat quickly.</p><p>All mixtures which are raised with eggs alone, should have the yolks and whites of the eggs thoroughly and separately beaten; any very thin batter, like pop-overs, pancakes, or gems made without eggs, should be beaten vigorously just before baking. Graham or whole-wheat flour is better than white flour for gems that are made without eggs, because it contains more gluten.</p><p>Shall we stir only one way? No; stir any way you please, so long as you blend or mix the materials. But after <emph rend="italic">beating in</emph> air bubbles, don't break them by <emph rend="italic">stirring,</emph> unless you wish to keep up the game of cross purposes indefinitely. Always let the last motion, before turning into the pans, be one of quick, vigorous <emph rend="italic">beating;</emph> except in those receipts where folding instead of beating is indicated.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">BREAD AND BREAD MAKING.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Importance of Bread.</emph>--Bread is one of the earliest, the most generally used, and the most important forms of food adopted by mankind. Nothing in the whole range of domestic life more affects the health and happiness of the family than the quality of its daily bread. With good bread, the plainest meal is a feast in itself; without it, the most elaborately prepared and elegantly served <emph rend="italic">menu</emph> is unsatisfactory.</p><p>Bread-making is at once the easiest and the most difficult branch of culinary science,--easy, if only sufficient interest be taken to master a few elementary principles and to follow them always, using the judgement of the best authorities, until experience furnishes a sufficient guide; difficult, if there be any neglect to use proper care and materials. It should be regarded as one of the highest accomplishments; and if one tenth part of the interest, time, and thought which are devoted to cake and pastry and fancy cooking were spent upon this most important article of food, the presence of good bread upon our tables would be invariably secured.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Origin and Meaning of "Bread."</emph>--Bread is made from a variety of substances,--roots, fruits, and the bark of trees; but more generally from certain grains. The word <emph rend="italic">bread</emph> is derived from the verb <emph rend="italic">to bray,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">pound,</emph> expressive of the old method of preparing the grain. Bread is therefore made of something brayed, as brayed wheat or brayed corn. But these brayed or ground materials are not properly bread until they are mixed or moistened with water. Then the brayed grain becomes <emph rend="italic">dough,</emph> from a word meaning <emph rend="italic">to wet,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">moisten.</emph> In primitive times this wetted meal or dough was baked at once in hot ashes, and made
 
<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=57"/>

a firm, compact bread, exceedingly hard of digestion. Accidentally some one discovered that by letting the dough stand till it had fermented, and then mixing it with new dough, it rasied, or lifted, the whole mass, and made it lighter and more porous. Thus we have our word <emph rend="italic">loaf,</emph> from <emph rend="italic">lifian,</emph> to raise, or lift up. The old dough--or leaven, as it is called--lifts up the dough. The raised mass is held in place by the heat in baking, and becomes the loaf of raised bread.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Bread made from Wheat.</emph>--Bread is made principally from <emph rend="italic">wheat flour.</emph> <emph rend="italic">Rye</emph> and <emph rend="italic">corm meal</emph> are sometimes used, but better results are obtained when there is a mixture of wheat with one or more of these grains. Rye used alone makes a close, moist, sticky bread; while corn meal alone makes too dry and crumbly a loaf.</p><p>Wheat is an annual grass of unknown origin, cultivated more extensively in the Northern hemisphere. There are over one hundred and fifty varieties of wheat. They are classified as red or white, in reference to the color of the grains; as winter or summer,--winter wheat being sown in the autumn, and summer wheat in the spring; as soft or hard,--soft wheat being tender and floury or starchy; and hard wheat being tough, firm, and containing more gluten.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Chemical Composition of Wheat.</emph>--Wheat is the only grain which contains gluten in the proper proportion and of the desired quality essential to the making of light, spongy bread. It contains all the elements necessary for the growth of the body; but, to meet all the requirements of nutrition, the whole of the grain, with the exception of the outer husk, should be used. Wheat has several layers of bran coats, the outer one of which is almost wholly pure silica and is perfectly indigestible. Underneath this

<pb n="38" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=58"/>

husk lie the inner bran coats, containing <emph rend="italic">gluten,</emph> a dark substance which is the nitrogenous or flesh-forming element, the <emph rend="italic">phosphates</emph> and other <emph rend="italic">mineral matters</emph> which help to make up the bony parts of the body, and the <emph rend="italic">oil</emph> which gives the characteristic odor to wheat grains. The centre, or heart, of the grain consists of cells filled with <emph rend="italic">starch,</emph> a fine, white, mealy powder, which has little value as food except as a heat producer. There is also a small amount of gluten diffused among the starch cells. For convenience, these different parts of the wheat will be designated as <emph rend="italic">bran,</emph> or the outer husk; <emph rend="italic">gluten,</emph> or the inner bran coats; and <emph rend="italic">starch,</emph> or the <emph rend="italic">heart</emph> of the wheat. The proportion and quality of the gluten and starch in different kinds of wheat vary according to the climate and soil in which they are grown. They are also affected by the method of grinding the grain. Wheat grown in Southern or warm climates, and in the intense, though short, summer of our own Northwest, contains more nitrogen than that grown in cold, damp climates. It loses more water by evaporation, and consequently the seed is smaller and harder. In some varieties of wheat the outer <emph rend="italic">husk</emph> is thin and smooth, and peels off readily under the stones. In others, it is thick and rough, and adheres closely to the kernel. In some, it is light-colored or brittle; in others, dark-colored or tough. The husky portion of wheat is about fourteen or sixteen per cent of the whole weight.</p>

<p>The <emph rend="italic">gluten</emph> of wheat is a gray, tough, elastic substance, consisting chiefly of vegetable fibrine. It can be examined
 
<pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=59"/>

easily by making a dough of flour and water, and working it on a sieve under a stream of water. The water will carry the starch, sugar, gum, and mineral matters into the pan below, leaving a lump of gluten on the sieve. It closely resembles a piece of animal skin, and, when dried, has a glue-like appearance; hence its name, <emph rend="italic">gluten.</emph> The proportion of gluten varies from eleven to fifteen per cent. This tough, elastic quality of the gluten determines the quality of the flour. The more gluten and the tougher or stronger it is, the better the flour. The gluten of good flour will swell to four or five times its original bulk; while that of poor flour does not swell, but becomes watery and sticky, and sometimes gives off a disagreeable odor, owing to the deterioration of the fatty or oily element.</p>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Preparing the Flour.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">St. Louis Process.</emph>--There are several methods of converting wheat into flour. One is by <emph rend="italic">grinding</emph> between two horizontal stones, the upper one revolving, and the lower one stationary. The surface of the stones presents an infinite number of minute cutting edges. The upper stone is convex, the lower one concave; but instead of fitting perfectly, they approach closer together from the centre outward, so that, as the grain is poured into an opening in the upper stone, it is at first rather coarsely crushed, and then cut finer and finer, as it is carried to the circumference by the centrifugal force. As the grain leaves the stones, the outer husk has been least affected; the tough, coherent gluten is divided minutely, while the brittle starch, which forms two thirds of the grain, is completely crushed. The miller then divides these products, by sifting or bolting, into <emph rend="italic">fine flour,</emph> <emph rend="italic">coarse flour,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">bran.</emph></p><p>The <emph rend="italic">bran</emph> should be discarded as utterly useless for human food; but it is often mixed with an inferior quality of fine flour, and sold as Graham flour. It was at one time considered valuable as a food for those suffering from constipation, chiefly on account of its coarseness; but
 
<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=60"/>

science has shown us recently that minute points of glass (and bran is nothing else) are not Nature's best agents in removing effete matters from the system. All of the so-called Graham flour made by this process should be sifted before using.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">coarse flour</emph> will vary in quality, according as it has more or less of the outer bran mixed with it. In the <emph rend="italic">soft wheats</emph> the husk peels off readily under the stones, and is easily separated by bolting; and as these soft varieties contain the smallest proportion of gluten, they yield a <emph rend="italic">coarse flour,</emph> containing only an average amount of gluten, and the <emph rend="italic">whitest fine-flour.</emph> But in the <emph rend="italic">hard, flinty</emph> wheats, this outer husk clings so closely that much of it is ground up finely with the flour, giving it a dark color. This flour, as it contains a large proportion of gluten, would be more nutritious were it not that much of the gluten adheres to the hulls, and is lost by sifting them out, and much of the fine, flinty bran is retained in the flour, which makes it irritating and indigestible.</p><p>The quality of the <emph rend="italic">fine flour</emph> depends upon the quality of the wheat, in the first place; also upon the number of siftings, being richer in gluten the less it is sifted; and upon the way in which it is stored. The process of grinding with the stones heats the flour; and as it is often thrust upon the market without being properly cooled and dried, it spoils very rapidly. Flour made by this process of grinding is called the <emph rend="italic">St. Louis,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">old-process</emph> flour. When made of the very best quality of grain and carefully prepared, it makes a sweet, nutritious bread, and is excellent in cake and pastry. It is often designated <emph rend="italic">pastry flour.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Haxall Process.</emph>--Another method of making flour is by the <emph rend="italic">new,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Haxall</emph> process, so called from the name of the inventor. By this process the outer husk is first removed, or <emph rend="italic">decorticated;</emph> then the cleaned grain is cut by a system of knives, which reduces it to a fine powder without the injurious effects of heating. This flour has a slightly granular consistency, owing to the presence of minute particles of hard, flinty gluten. It is usually made
 
<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=61"/>

from the best quality of wheat, and keeps well. It is considered by many as the best flour for bread, as it makes a whiter, nicer-looking loaf. Haxall flour swells more than that made by the old process, as it contains more of the gluten: the same measure making a greater quantity of bread than the St. Louis flour. It is, therefore, cheaper in the end, though costing more per barrel. By repeated siftings, this flour loses its gluten, as does that made by the St. Louis process, and consequently is then inferior as a food. But we can supply by other flours and other food what this flour lacks in nutritious qualities; and until the popular taste is educated to demand the amount of nutriment contained in bread rather than the whiteness of it, as a test of its quality, it is well to make our fine, white bread from this, which is the best flour, and have it as nearly perfect as possible.</p><p>There have been many variations of the Haxall process, and all are included under the term <emph rend="italic">new-process flour.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Minnesota.</emph>--The Minnesota, or patent-process, flour is now considered one of the best grades. The Washburn, Pillsbury, and many other mills located in Minneapolis are the largest flour-mills in the world, and produce an excellent quality of flour, in which a large proportion of the gluten is retained. This Minnesota flour is made from carefully selected wheat grown in the Red River region, the best wheat-growing section in America. The first step in the process is the breaking off of the germinal point of each grain by what are called ending stones. Then it is sent through corrugated iron rollers, having shallow grooves cut spirally upon them, with rounded ridges between, and the opposing rollers grooved in an opposite direction. The grains are crushed (not ground); the starchy parts, or middlings, being quite finely powdered and easily separated from the bran or tailings. After this separation the middlings are passed through ten bolting-cloths, and then through other and finer corrugated machines, and made into the various grades of <emph rend="italic">fine, superfine,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">fancy</emph> flours.</p>
 
<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=62"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Health-Food Flour.</emph>--A still better method of converting wheat into flour, and one which is indorsed by leading scientists and physicians, has been recently introduced by the Health Food Company of New York. Only the choicest kinds of wheat are used. The outer husk is first removed by moistening the grain, and subjecting it to a gentle rubbing by what is termed the "attrition process." This softens the woody fibre of the outer bran, which is easily removed by sifting, but does not affect the hard gluten coats. The grains are dried, then pulverized into various grades by a compressed cold-air blast, which dashes the grains into atoms with tremendous force. This is called <emph rend="italic">whole-wheat</emph> flour, the name indicating that the whole of the gluten, or nutritive part of the flour, is retained. It is not sifted like other flours, but pulverized into all the varieties of <emph rend="italic">crushed wheat, coarse granulated</emph> and <emph rend="italic">fine granulated wheat;</emph> each variety, even the finest flour, containing all that is valuable as food. Bread made with this flour has been found, after repeated trial, to be sweet and agreeable to the taste, light and spongy in texture, with none of the objectionable features of Graham bread, and answering fully all the demands of perfect nutrition.</p><p>Cheap inferior Graham flour, made of poor flour mixed with bran, is worse than no food at all. Any flour containing much of the indigestible bran causes irritation of the digestive organs; all the food is hurried through the alimentary canal before digestion is complete or all the nutriment can be absorbed, and thus is neither economical nor healthful. Fine flour containing the most gluten is the most nutritious, because it is all digested, and the loss of albuminous material can be supplied from other sources.</p><p>The Arlington, the Franklin, and some other brands of whole-wheat flour, are highly indorsed by those familiar with them.</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Tests of Good Flour.</hd>
<p>The first requisite in making good bread is to use good flour. Good flour should not be pure white in color, but
 
<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=63"/>

of a creamy, yellowish-white shade. If it feel damp, clammy, or sticky, and gradually form into lumps or cakes, it is not the best. Good flour holds together in a mass, when squeezed by the hand, and retains the impression of the fingers, and even the marks of the skin, much longer than poor flour; when made into a dough, it is elastic, easy to be kneaded, will stay in a round puffy shape, and will take up a large amount of water; while poor flour will be sticky, flatten, or spread itself over the board, and will never seem to be stiff enough to be handled, no matter how much flour is used. Haxall flour has a fine granular consistency, and runs easily through the sieve or the fingers like fine meal; while good St. Louis flour feels soft and oily. It is extravagant to buy poor or even doubtful flour. But, should it have every appearance of being good flour, and yet not make good bread, do not condemn the flour without a fair trial; and be sure the fault is nowhere else.</p><p>Every experienced cook has her own tests for flour, and some of them are amusing, if not reliable. The best way is to buy a small quantity at first, and make it into dough; then, if satisfactory, purchase whatever amount is required, and buy this same brand as long as it proves of uniform quality. The flour may come from the same growth of wheat, and be ground in the same manner and at the same mill, and yet the miller or the wholesale dealers will brand it differently. And the same brand will vary in quality from year to year. Some of the varieties sold in Boston, and known to be good by personal trial, are Archibald's Extra, Washburn's, Spaulding, Corrugated, Taylor's Best, Brown's Best, Marguerite, etc.; the same flour may be known in other cities under different names. There are others equally good, and every year some new brand is announced. It is estimated that one barrel of flour will last one person one year; which gives a rule of proportion by which to buy. Most good housekeepers agree that flour is not improved by long keeping, though
 
<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=64"/>

flour dealers think differently. Flour should be kept in a cool, dry place, as the least dampness causes it to absorb moisture; the gluten loses its tenacity, becomes sticky, and the bread made from it is coarser and less light.</p><p>For small families it is better to buy whole-wheat flour by the bag or half-barrel; Haxall, for bread, by the barrel; and the best St. Louis flour for cake and pastry, by the bag, as a much smaller proportion is needed (or should be) for these indigestibles, than for the "staff of life."</p></section>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Bread, Fermented and Unfermented.</hd>
<p>Now, having discussed the subject of the flour, the next step in order is the different ways of making it into bread. These may all be included under two divisions,--those made by fermentation, and those without fermentation.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fermentation, what is it?</emph>--Fermentation is that change in organic substances by which their sugar, starch, gluten, etc., are decomposed or recombined into new compounds. This change may be spontaneous under favorable conditions of air, moisture, and warmth; or it may be hastened by the presence of a ferment. A <emph rend="italic">ferment</emph> is some albuminous substance in a state of decomposition, and, when introduced into any other albuminous substance, in however minute a quantity, causes a change which pervades the whole mass. These fermenting substances are in great variety, and the germs of some of them are always present in the air. There are different kinds of fermentation.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">lactic fermentation</emph> is the change in milk when it sours. The casein, or albuminous part of the milk, by exposure to the air and warmth, begins to decompose, becomes a ferment, and changes the sugar of the milk into an acid called lactic acid. This reacts upon the remainder of the milk, as any acid would, and causes it to coagulate or harden, and gives it a sour taste.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">alcoholic fermentation</emph> is that which is produced in substances rich in sugar or starch, as the fruits and grains from which wines and beer are made. Some of these ferment
 
<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=65"/>

germs are present in the juice of grapes; and under the influence of air, moisture, and warmth, they seize upon the sugar already present in the natural fruit juices, and any that may be added, and convert it into carbonic acid gas and alcohol. In the grains, a portion of the gluten ferments and changes the starch into sugar, and then the sugar into carbonic acid and alcohol. In converting the starch into sugar there is no change evident to the eye; but as soon as the sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid gas, large bubbles of gas appear, which swell the whole mass.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Acetic fermentation</emph> is caused by allowing alcoholic fermentation to go on beyond a certain limit, or in a temperature above 90&#176;. A familiar illustration of this is the change of wine or cider into vinegar.</p><p>Now, bread-dough contains gluten, sugar, and starch; and if the dough be kept warm for a certain time, <emph rend="italic">lactic fermentation</emph> will be developed <emph rend="italic">spontaneously,</emph> and the bread made from such dough will be sour and heavy. Alcoholic fermentation can also be <emph rend="italic">spontaneously</emph> produced in dough, by making first a batter (as the semi-fluid state is more favorable to rapid chemical change), and subjecting it to a temperature of 110&#176; for five or six hours; then, adding more flour, allowing it to rise again, and then baking it. Bread made in this way is called <emph rend="italic">salt</emph> or <emph rend="italic">milk-rising's bread.</emph> But it does not keep well, and is not generally liked.</p><p>It is not always convenient to wait for dough to be raised in this manner, so we hasten the process by the addition of some active ferment. Leaven, or a piece of old dough, left to sour, and then mixed with the new dough was formerly used; this produced <emph rend="italic">lactic</emph> as well as <emph rend="italic">alcoholic</emph> fermentation, and though the bread was light and spongy in texture, it had an unpleasant sour taste. But since the chemistry of yeast fermentation has been understood, <emph rend="italic">yeast</emph> has come to be considered the best ferment for producing alcoholic fermentation in bread rapidly, and with no objectionable result.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">Yeast, what is it?</emph>--Yeast is a plant or germ of the fungus tribe. Under the microscope it is found to consist of numberless minute rounded or oval bodies which are true vegetable cells. Yeast is therefore one of the simplest and smallest of vegetable organisms. Each little cell consists of an enveloping skin or membrane, containing a liquid or sap. They grow or expand from the minutest microscopic points, and seem to bud off from each other and multiply into many millions to the cubic inch. These cells are easily propagated in any medium where they find congenial food, particularly in the juice of grapes. If grape-juice be filtered and left to stand in a warm place two or three hours, it becomes first cloudy, then thick, and gives off bubbles of gas, showing there has been some change in its composition. In a short time a grayish-yellow froth, or layer of yeast cells, collects on the surface. "Whether the germs or spores of the yeast plant exist already in the juices of the living grape, or whether they are always floating in the air, and cling to the exterior of the fruit, and only become mixed with the juice in the <implement>wine-press,</implement> is not known;" neither is it known just how they decompose the sugar of the grape. But it is enough for our purpose to know that they grow in the juice and expand there, and that an active ferment may be dissolved out of these yeast cells, sufficient to cause alcoholic fermentation.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 4. Yeast Plant.</caption><description>A magnified illustration of yeast.</description></illustration>
<p>The natural development of yeast through the agency of plants is too slow and inconvenient a process to rely upon; therefore we manufacture it from various substances rich in starch and sugar. Brewer's yeast is made from malt, or sprouting grain, usually barley; home-made yeast, from flour and potatoes.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Yeast Bread the Result of Chemical Changes.</emph>--Bread properly made with yeast undergoes certain chemical changes which render it lighter, more porous, more pleasant

to the taste, and more healthful, because more easily digested, and more convenient for general use. It is generally recommended by scientific and medical men as the best form of bread.</p><p>Wheat contains a larger percentage of starch than of anything else. We learn, in the chapter on Digestion, that starch as such is not absorbed into the human system. It must first be transformed into sugar. All starch that is not changed into sugar by the process of cooking or before our food is eaten, is so changed by the <emph rend="italic">ptyalin,</emph> or ferment of the saliva, and the ferment of the pancreatic fluid. Any process which produces this change for us makes our food more digestible. "Powdered alum will dissolve in water sooner than a crystal of alum." Any fluid will penetrate more easily through a sponge than through putty, and the salivary and gastric fluids are no exception to this rule. Wheat starch in its natural state is close and compact; and bread made simply with flour and water, and baked at once, will be close, dry, and difficult to masticate and digest. Good bread should be sufficiently soft to be easily crushed in the mouth, and of such a light, spongy texture that all the starch cells may be ruptured, and the greatest possible amount of surface be presented to the action of the digestive fluids. To obtain these qualities in bread, we try to expand the dough as much as possible without destroying its natural sweetness. Owing to the peculiar elasticity and tenacity of the wheat gluten, this is very easily accomplished by alcoholic fermentation. The flour is moistened with some warm liquid, yeast and salt are added, and it is then exposed for some hours to a temperature of about 70&#176;. The yeast changes some of the starch of the flour into sugar, and the sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid gas. This gas, being lighter than the dough, rises, and, in its efforts to escape, expands the elastic, glutinous dough into a mass two or three times its original bulk. The toughness or elasticity of the gluten prevents the gas from escaping; and when this expansion has reached the desired limit,--that is, before the alcoholic fermentation has changed
 
<pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=68"/>

to the acetic and soured the dough, or the tough, glutinous walls of the air cells are broken,--we check the formation of gas, and kill the ferment by baking the dough in a hot oven. The alcohol escapes into the oven; some of the starch is changed into gum, and forms the crust; and the rapid decomposition, produced by the intense heat, causes the crust to assume a brown color.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Unfermented Bread.</emph>--This is made without yeast; but the principle is the same as in fermented bread, namely, the liberation of gas within the dough. The gas escapes quickly, and all such bread must be baked as soon as possible after mixing. There are no chemical changes in the starch or sugar; the elastic, glutinous dough is simply expanded by the gas. The starch cells are ruptured by the intense heat in baking; but if the gas bubbles burst before the heat has fixed the gluten wall, the bread will be heavy. This gas is produced in the bread dough in various ways: 1st. By the gas in very cold water, and the air obtained by vigorous beating; 2d. By the introduction of water under pressure, highly charged with gas. The first method is only suitable for mixtures which are to be baked quickly in a very hot oven, and eaten immediately, like gems, puffs, etc. The latter method produces what is known as aerated bread, making a light, sweet, spongy loaf; but it is not practicable for home use. 3d. The usual method is by some gas-generating compound, as the union of an acid and an alkali; usually soda, with either sour milk, cream of tartar, or muriatic acid. This is a convenient form adopted by many people who think it hard work to make yeast bread. When the chemicals used are pure, and in such a proportion that they neutralize each other, and leave only Rochelle salt as a residue, this bread, if used only occasionally, is harmless. But Rochelle salt is a medicine, not a nutritive food; and "those who are well do not need the disturbing influence of a medicine in their daily bread," and those who are ill do not often need this particular form of medicine. Through ignorance or carelessness this bread is often made so that there is an excess
 
<pb n="49" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=69"/>

of alkali or a residue of alum; and then, if used habitually, it is injurious, and to some extent poisonous. It is convenient to know how to make it well in an emergency, and it helps make variety. It is best, when freshly baked, in the form of small biscuit rather than in loaves, and is not as indigestible, when eaten hot, as hot yeast bread. But for a bread for general use, for bread that will keep well, for bread that will leave a sweet, clean taste in the mouth, for bread that will yield the most in bulk from a given amount of flour, for bread for promoting health, there is nothing equal to perfect, home-made yeast bread. It is not so difficult a task to make perfect bread as most young housekeepers imagine, or old housekeepers assert. It is not impossible for a young girl to succeed as well in her first attempt in this art as the mature housekeeper who counts her loaves by the thousand, provided she learns the best way of making it, and uses a reasonable amount of common-sense.</p></section>

<p>Who made the first yeast? and how does a young house-keeper start her own, when away from stores or friends, where she can neither buy nor borrow? are questions often asked. Simply make a thin batter with flour and water, and let it stand in a warm place till it ferments, and is full of bubbles. A pint of this ferment is equal to one cup of old yeast in starting the new.</p><p>There are three kinds of yeast in general use,--the <emph rend="italic">dry,</emph> the <emph rend="italic">compressed,</emph> and the <emph rend="italic">liquid,</emph>--each of which has its peculiar merits.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Dry yeast cakes,</emph> such as the "National" or "Twin Brothers," are inexpensive, always ready to use, and generally liked by those who care more for economy of time and trouble than for the quality of their bread.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Compressed yeast cakes,</emph> like the "Vienna" or "Fleischmann's," are excellent, when perfectly fresh; the best form of yeast where bread is made in large quantities. But for a small family, where only a quarter of a cake is used perhaps
 
<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=70"/>

perhaps twice a week, or for those living at a distance from the stores, they are inconvenient, expensive, and wasteful. They have almost entirely taken the place of baker's yeast.</p><p>As to which is best of the many varieties of home-made yeast, who shall decide when housekeepers disagree? Every good cook thinks <emph rend="italic">her</emph> way <emph rend="italic">the best.</emph> They are all good that make good bread; the only special advantage of one over another being the greater ease in making or the length of time it will keep good. People who are inclined to shirk think it a deal of trouble to make yeast of any kind; but there are none so independent as those who make their own yeast.</p><p>The simplest form of liquid yeast is made with flour, salt, and boiling hop water. To this many add potatoes and a little sugar, and some add ginger. Chemists say that the potato is the best form of starch for the growth of yeast. Potato yeast rises more rapidly, and keeps longer without souring, than flour yeast; bread made from it is sweet, light, and does not dry quickly. As to the comparative merits of grated raw potato or boiled potato, those who have used them both ways with equally good results think the grated potato has the advantage of being made in much less time.</p><p>The really essential points are that the water shall be <emph rend="italic">boiling,</emph> so that all the cells of the flour or potato may be ruptured. The salt and sugar assist in the fermentation, and the hops and ginger serve to prevent the yeast from souring by checking the fermentation before all the sugar is converted into alcohol; they also give it an agreeably pungent taste, if not used in too large quantities. Old potatoes are better than new for yeast, because they contain more sugar. Porcelain or granite kettles for boiling the hops and potatoes, and earthen bowls and wooden spoons for mixing, are best, as iron and tin cause the yeast to turn dark-colored.</p><p>The yeast for starting must be fresh and lively, and never added till the boiling mixture has become lukewarm,

or the plant will be killed. It must be kept warm, and stirred several times while rising, and the next day put away in well-scalded glass jars. Keep it in a cool place; freezing or intense heat will kill the yeast plant. Reserve a portion for the next rising in a small jar by itself, as opening the jar often causes the yeast to lose its strength. Always shake or stir well before using. Yeast is good when it is foamy or full of beads, has a brisk, pungent odor, and a good deal of snap or vim; it is poor when it has an acid odor, and looks watery or has a thin film over the top.</p></section>
<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Making the Dough.</hd>
<p>Flour is moistened, or made into dough, with water or with milk. This softens the gluten and starch, dissolves the sugar, and cements all the particles together. Those who prefer water claim that water bread is cheaper, has more of the natural sweet taste of the wheat, and will keep longer; while those in favor of using milk are equally sure that milk bread is more nutritious, more tender, more agreeable to the taste and the eye, more easily made, and with proper care will keep sweet and moist longer.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Proportion.</emph>--The proportion of liquid and flour varies both with the flour and the liquid. Bread made of St. Louis flour, or mixed with water, takes more flour to make the same amount, than when made of Haxall flour, or mixed with milk. The general rule is <emph rend="italic">one scant measure</emph> of liquid, including the yeast, to <emph rend="italic">three full measures</emph> of flour. Water bread will need about one cupful more; and milk bread, or whole-wheat bread, from one half to one cupful less of flour. Dough which is to be kneaded, or rolled and cut into special shapes, should be stiffer than that which is not kneaded, or is to be made into loaves; but in all cases it should be mixed just as soft as can be handled easily without sticking, and just as little extra flour as possible should be used. If the dough be too stiff, make several deep incisions, and work in a little more liquid. The proportion of yeast is <emph rend="italic">half a cupful of fresh home-made
 
<pb n="52" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=72"/>

yeast to a pint of liquid:</emph> a little less in warm weather; or when mixed at night, when the dough has a longer time to rise; or when made with a "sponge," or with whole-wheat flour, as the extra amount of gluten in this flour causes it to ferment more rapidly. A larger amount of yeast can be used when it is necessary to make bread in a limited time; but great care must be taken not to use enough to leave an unpleasant yeasty taste in the bread. With compressed yeast, dissolve <emph rend="italic">one fourth of a cake in half a cupful of lukewarm water,</emph> and use as home-made yeast. It will dissolve in one tablespoonful of water; but it is important to have the half-cupful, that the proportion of liquid may be the same.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Manner of Mixing.</emph>--Many people prefer to measure the flour, and add enough of the liquid to make it the desired consistency. The better way is to measure the liquid, and add flour, using more or less according to the quality of the flour, as the measure of the liquid determines the size of the loaf. All the flour may be added at first, and the dough raised in a mass; or a drop batter may be made with about half the flour, and when this has well risen, the remainder of the flour may be added, and the whole allowed to rise again. The latter method is preferable when it is inconvenient to knead at the first mixing as is often the case in the evening, or when there is any doubt about the quality of the yeast, as, if the yeast will not raise three cups of flour, it certainly will not raise six. This method is advisable, also, when it is necessary to hasten the process of bread-making. Dough made by "setting a sponge," as this way is called, requires less yeast, the fermentation being more rapid in a batter than in a stiff dough; and this fermented batter acts like a double portion of yeast on the fresh flour, raising it very quickly. It is the best way of making bread with milk in the summer, as it may be mixed early in the morning and baked by noon; and as it may be easily watched, it need not become sour. The question of mixing at night or in the morning is one which every housekeeper can best answer for herself.
 
<pb n="53" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=73"/>

Many old receipts read, "Make a hole in the flour, add the yeast, and then pour in the liquid." If the yeast be added to the milk or water, and well mixed with it, and the flour then stirred thoroughly into this liquid mixture, the yeast will be more evenly distributed through the dough, and less kneading will be required than when made by the old method.</p><p>The other ingredients added to the dough are <emph rend="italic">salt</emph> and <emph rend="italic">sugar,</emph> in the proportion of <emph rend="italic">one even teaspoonful of salt</emph> and <emph rend="italic">one even tablespoonful of sugar</emph> to <emph rend="italic">three pints of flour,</emph> using a little less salt if butter is added, and a little more with compressed yeast, as that is not as salt as home-made yeast, and doubling the amount of sugar when using whole-wheat flour.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Sugar in Bread.</emph>--Many object to the use of sugar in bread. Flour in its natural state contains sugar; this sugar is changed in fermentation. Just enough sugar to restore the natural sweetness, but not enough to give a really sweet taste, is necessary in fermented bread.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Potatoes.</emph>--Potatoes are sometimes added to bread dough. Where the flour is of an inferior quality, the bread is very much improved by their use; but with good flour they are unnecessary, and the use of them increases the labor of making bread.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Shortening.</emph>--Whether bread shall be "shortened or not shortened," is another question on which there is great diversity of opinion. Those who disapprove of fat of any kind in bread claim that we eat fat enough in other forms of food, and also that the same crisp tenderness of texture may be produced by skilful kneading. Bread made with new or unskimmed milk, and kneaded well, requires no other shortening; but water bread, when shortened, is made more tender, and therefore is more easily penetrated by the digestive fluids. The latest decision of the best physicians is that fat is absolutely necessary as an element of food, and it is often given as a remedy for some diseases. The proportion which one person would receive from one tablespoonful of butter, or drippings, or
 
<pb n="54" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=74"/>

lard, in two loaves of bread would not harm the most delicate stomach. Butter tastes best; drippings are cheapest. Lard has for its chief merit that of making whiter bread than either of the others. The shortening may be rubbed into the flour, or, better still, melted in the warm liquid. Too much shortening clogs the glutinous cell-walls, and therefore checks the rising. Rolls, rusks, and buns, which are usually shortened more than loaf bread, should have the butter added at the last kneading.</p><p>The bread should be mixed in a deep stone-china or granite bowl; wooden bowls are difficult to keep sweet and clean. Brown earthenware is awkward in shape and clumsy to handle, while tinware, being a better conductor than china, lets the heat within the mass escape, and the tin rubs off from the constant friction. Use a wooden spoon, or a wooden-handled iron spoon, or a broad-bladed knife.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Kneading the Dough.</emph>--Kneading is the process of pressing or working the dough in such a manner that the flour and water may be thoroughly mixed, and the yeast be so evenly distributed that the fermentation may be equal through the whole mass. It may be done by cutting or chopping, either with the hand or machinery; but there is nothing that gives the fine, even grain to bread so well as hand-kneading; and no surer test of the proper consistency of dough than that given by the sense of touch. There are some kinds of milk bread and rolls which are very good without it; but water bread should always be kneaded. It is often done in the mixing-bowl, by drawing the dough over from the side and pressing it down in the centre, turning the bowl with the other hand; but it is more effectually accomplished on a <implement>bread-board.</implement> In Spain the bakers knead the bread with such force that the palms of the hands and the second joints of the fingers are covered with corns; but strength and force are not so essential to good kneading as a peculiar and dexterous handling of the dough. The most approved process is the following:--</p>
 
<pb n="55" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=75"/>

<p>Sprinkle the board with flour, and leave a little in the corner to lay your hands upon. Scrape the dough from the bowl, and toss it over with the knife that it may be well floured. Flour the hands; then, with the finger-tips, draw the dough farthest from you up and over toward the centre, letting the ball of the hand meet the dough, and then press down firmly, giving the dough somewhat of a rolling motion, that it may not stick to the board. Repeat this motion until the dough is in a long narrow shape, then turn it at right angles, and draw up, fold, and press down again; and continue this process until the dough is smooth, elastic, fine, and even-grained. Dust the board and the palms of the hands with flour often, but only slightly. Should the dough stick, lift it quickly, and always scrape off what has adhered to the board before dusting again, that the board may be kept smooth. But do not let it stick; keep it in constant motion. Do not knead hard enough to break into the dough, nor let the finger-tips pierce the smooth crust that soon forms under proper kneading. Use the fingers merely in drawing the dough over, and keep them up and out of it when pressing with the ball of the hand. Use both hands in the same manner, or draw up and press with the right, and turn the ball of dough with the left, that all parts may receive an equal pressure. When enough of this smooth, soft texture has been formed all through the dough, it can be worked for some time without even a dusting of flour. After a little experience, if care be taken in the beginning, and only a little flour added at each dusting, when the dough is sufficiently kneaded, the hands, the apron, and the board will be clean, and the dough of an even, elastic consistency, springing up instantly as you toss or pound or punch into it. The habit of mixing with the hands, and rubbing off little wads of dough from the fingers into the whole mass, should be avoided, especially toward the last of the process. There is no mechanical operation in cooking more fascinating than the deft, quick touches a natural kneader gives to a mass of dough. Young ladies

with pretty hands can display them there quite as well as with embroidery, etc.; but the rings and bracelets should be left in the jewel-case. The stitches in tight dress sleeves are <emph rend="italic">not "warranted not to break"</emph> during this process. Perfect freedom for the muscles of the arms and chest is absolutely essential to the making and kneading of bread.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Temperature and Time for the Raising of Bread.</emph>--In winter the water or milk used in mixing should be luke-warm; and if the flour be kept in a very cold place, warm it before using. In summer the water need not be warmed, neither should it be ice-water; the milk should be scalded (not boiled), and cooled. After the bread is kneaded sufficiently it must be made into a smooth round ball, with no dry flour left on the surface, and put back in the mixing-bowl to rise. If you have learned the knack of scraping a bowl thoroughly, it need not be washed; otherwise it is well to wash and grease the bowl, that the dough may come out more easily after it has risen. Notice how it fills the bowl, and let it rise until it has a little more than doubled in size. Cover it, not with a cloth alone, as that serves merely to keep out the dust, but with several thicknesses of cloth, and a tightly fitting tin cover. It is important that the air be excluded, as it causes a hard crust to form, which will be difficult to mix thoroughly in the dough at the next kneading, and will also leave dark spots or streaks in the bread.</p><p>The dough should rise in a temperature of about 75&#176;. Avoid a draught of cold air, or sudden alterations of extreme heat and cold. If it be placed on a mantel or near a stove, it must be turned frequently. When necessary to hasten the rising, place the bowl in a pan of warm (not hot) water, and keep the water at the same temperature until it begins to rise. After fermentation has been well established the temperature can be lowered without harm, provided it does not fall below 45&#176;. In winter, bread should be mixed early in the evening; and if the kitchen become very cold before morning, keep the dough in a
 
<pb n="57" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=77"/>

warmer room; it will be risen by six or seven in the morning. In summer, mix it later at night, leave it in a cool place, and the next morning attend to it early; if possible, by five o'clock. In very hot weather mix early in the morning, and bake by noon. It should never be allowed to rise to the point of "caving in," or settling, or running over the bowl. Even if it does not become sour, it loses the natural sweet flavor of the wheat, and is tasteless and insipid. It should rise in a light, puffy, well-rounded mass; and if it half filled the bowl at first, it will be ready, when risen nearly to the top of the bowl, "to cut down," as most cooks express it. This is done by cutting it away from the sides of the bowl, and working it over into the centre with the knife. This releases some of the gas, checks the fermentation, and reduces the bulk somewhat. It will rise again very quickly, and the cutting-down process can be repeated several times, and the bread will be the better for it, provided the rising does not go too far at any time. It takes but a moment, and should always be done when the dough is risen sufficiently, if you are not ready to shape it at once into loaves. If you do not wish to bake the bread for several hours, it can be kneaded again and put in the <implement>ice-chest</implement> or cellar. When the dough rises too long, and has soured, it will have a strong, tingling acid odor as you cut into it, and it will pull away from the bowl in long threads, having a watery appearance, quite unlike the proper spongy consistency and pungent alcoholic odor when it is just right. The practice of using soda to sweeten it, when in this state, cannot be too severely condemned. Chemists say that <emph rend="italic">light</emph> sour bread is not unhealthful, although unpalatable to most Americans. Bread in that condition is eaten largely by the Germans. Sour bread sweetened by soda <emph rend="italic">is</emph> unhealthful, as it is very rarely that the alkali is wholly neutralized by the acetic acid. Those who boast of never having sour bread because they always keep a bottle of soda dissolved and ready for instant use, should, instead, blush at the fact of such careless housewifery. With proper care, bread, even
 
<pb n="58" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=78"/>

when made with milk, need never sour. But should the accident ever occur, it is better to eat the bread, or dry it for crumbs, or throw it away even, than to use the soda. This practice is so abominable that here it will receive neither aid nor encouragement.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Shaping into Loaves or Biscuit.</emph>--At least an hour before the time for baking, scrape the dough from the bowl, and turn it out upon the board, which should be dusted with flour; knead it slightly, and divide into the proper proportion for loaves.</p><p>The measures given in the following receipts fill two <implement>brickloaf pans,</implement> which are eight inches long by four inches broad and five inches deep, with nearly straight sides. This shape gives small uniform slices. Small round pans were formerly considered best for baking both bread and cake; and there is some truth in the reason given, namely, that the cells which are formed by the gas are circular in form, and are much more uniform in a round than in an oblong loaf, in which the corner cells are easily flattened or compressed, forming heavy streaks around the edges. But many people dislike the shape of the slices in a round loaf, and oblong pans have been more generally adopted. They should be greased with lard or drippings. It is better to divide the dough into four equal parts and put two in each pan, for several reasons: a small round loaf is more easily shaped, and can be broken, if wanted, while fresh, better than a long loaf; two small loaves rise and fill the pan more evenly than one long loaf; and unless great care be taken in shaping to have the one loaf of uniform thickness, it will rise more in the middle and give uneven slices. Many make a deep cut through the middle to prevent this; but that spoils the smooth round effect which adds so much to the looks of the crust.</p><p>Use the merest dusting of flour in shaping, and knead just enough to work out the large bubbles of gas by folding the mass over into the middle, then letting it spring open. Pat, coax, and work it with the hand and fingers
 
<pb n="59" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=79"/>

until there are no wrinkles, and the loaves are smooth. Greasing the hands slightly with butter helps. All the flour added at this kneading rises but once, and too much will make the loaf burst out unevenly at the sides. Some careless kneaders merely fold it over, and if it look smooth on the top they think that enough; but their loaf will sometimes have a seam or crack through it, which will cause the slices to fall apart easily.</p><p>The loaves should come nearly half-way up the pan; and the same rule follows as for the first rising, namely, let it come to the top, or till the bulk is doubled. Cover with cloth and tin cover, or a large tin pan. The time for rising varies with the lightness of the dough and the temperature of the room. It is impossible to give a definite rule; but should it rise too far and stick to the cloth, or look "tumbled in," cut it down, knead, and let it rise again. Never bake it in the above state, as it will be coarse-grained, if not hollow. It is better to bake it a little too soon than to let it rise too long.</p><p>Rolls and small biscuit should rise in the pans longer and be baked in a hotter oven than the loaf, because the loaf rises in the oven until the heat has penetrated to the centre; while in the rolls the air cells are very quickly fixed by the intense heat needed to perfect the crust, and fermentation is almost immediately checked. This is contrary to the usual practice; but it is the correct way. Many people prepare biscuit for breakfast by letting them rise ten or fifteen minutes in a very hot place while the oven is heating. They are often only half baked, and then eaten smoking hot; and those who have never had anything else think them just right. The evil effects of this practice have been the occasion for much of the outcry against hot, or even fresh, biscuit. Such are entirely different from the dry, light, delicious biscuit which have had a natural, not a forced, rising, are of the proper texture, have been baked quickly, and allowed to stand at least half an hour before being eaten. The moral of the above is, never try to have raised biscuit for breakfast without

rising at least three hours before breakfast-time, unless you wish your family to become slaves to indigestion.</p><p><emph rend="italic">The Temperature for Baking.</emph>--The object of baking bread is to kill the ferment, rupture the starch grains, fix the air cells, and form a nicely flavored crust. Bread could be baked by steam, as the air cells become fixed at 212&#176;, and the temperature of the inside of the loaf, owing to the moisture, never rises above that point; but, to give the delicious flavor of the browned crust, a much higher temperature is needed. The oven should be hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of flour in <emph rend="italic">one minute</emph> for rolls, and in <emph rend="italic">five minutes</emph> for loaves. This is a good rule for those who do not use a thermometer, or cannot judge of the heat by their hands. The heat should be greater at the bottom than at the top of the oven, and of sufficient strength to last through the time of baking (which is about an hour) without replenishing the fire. Divide the time into thirds; the first fifteen or twenty minutes the heat should increase, remain steady during the next, and decrease toward the last. The dough should rise, and, after fifteen minutes, begin to brown slightly. If the oven be too hot, and the loaf brown too fast, a hard crust will be formed before the heat reaches the centre, and, pressing down on the air cells, make a heavy streak; or, if removed from the oven too soon, it will be raw and doughy inside. If the heat be not sufficient to form the crust in fifteen minutes, the dough will go on rising until it becomes sour and pasty, and the air cells will run together, making a hole in the middle. The baking of bread is something that will not take care of itself. The old notion that you must not look at anything in the oven is erroneous; and until you have learned by experience just how to regulate the fire and oven, and the many tests by which every good cook determines when bread is done, look at it often, and bake according to the clock from fifty to sixty minutes. Better bake ten minutes too long, putting a paper over the top to prevent a burned crust, than not long enough. Bake it <emph rend="italic">brown,</emph> not black, nor pale whity-brown,
 
<pb n="61" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=81"/>

but <emph rend="italic">brown</emph> all over. Rolls are often brushed with milk just before and after baking, to give them a richer brown color. Rubbing over with soft butter while still hot makes a crisp, delicious crust. When well baked, if tapped with the fingers, a hollow, empty sound will be emitted; the crust feels firm, and, if broken apart, the inside rebounds instantly on any slight pressure.</p><p><emph rend="italic">The Care of Bread after Baking.</emph>--Remove the loaves immediately from the pans, and place them where the air can circulate freely round them and thus carry off the gas which has been formed, but is no longer needed. A <implement>bread or cake cooler,</implement> made of fine wire, set in a narrow frame thirty inches long by twelve or fifteen broad, is a very useful article, as it will hold several loaves. An old wire window-screen, too small for modern windows, with cleats on the ends, to keep it two or three inches from the table, answers the purpose admirably. Many use a <implement>wire sieve;</implement> but that is small, and leaves the marks of the larger cross wires on the loaf. Never leave the bread in the pan, or on a pine table, to sweat and absorb the odor of the wood.</p><p>If you like crusts that are crisp, do not cover the loaves; but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which many prefer, wrap them, while still hot, in several thicknesses of bread cloth. When cold, put them into a stone jar or tin box; remove the cloth, as that absorbs the moisture, and gives the bread an unpleasant taste and odor. Keep the jar well covered and carefully cleansed from crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly every two or three days. A yard and a half square of coarse table linen makes the best bread cloth. Keep a good supply; keep them sweet and clean, and use them for no other purpose.</p><p>Fine white bread should be partaken of in moderation. Although the "staff of life," it is not necessary to eat bread with every kind of diet. It is most useful when taken with articles containing a large proportion of nourishment in a small bulk, as it then gives the stomach the proper degree of expansion.</p></section>

</p><p>First, see that you have at least three quarts of water boiling rapidly. Pare the potatoes, and keep them covered with cold water. Mix the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, and grate the potatoes as quickly as possible, not stopping to grate every scrap; mix them at once with the flour, using a wooden or silver spoon, that the mixture may not be dark-colored. Pour the boiling water directly from the teakettle over the <implement>grater,</implement> and rinse off the potato into the bowl, using perhaps a pint of water at first. Mix the water thoroughly with the potato and flour; then add, slowly, enough more boiling water to make it the consistency of thin starch. The amount of water will depend upon the quality of the flour and potatoes. If it does not thicken, pour the mixture into a <implement>double boiler</implement> or <implement>granite pan,</implement> and let it come to the boiling-point, stirring well to keep it from sticking. Strain through a <implement>squash strainer</implement> and let it cool. When lukewarm (clear through the mixture, not merely on the top), add the yeast. Cover slightly, and keep in a warm (not hot) place, until light and covered with white foam. After it begins to rise, beat it well several times, as this makes it stronger. At night, or when well risen, put it into wide-mouthed earthen or glass jars. The next morning cover tightly, and keep it in a cool place. Reserve one cupful or more in a small glass jar, and do not open it until ready for the next yeast-making. Always shake yeast well before using; take your cup to the jar instead of taking the jar to the hot kitchen; when empty, scald the jar and the cover thoroughly. This is the quickest and easiest way of making yeast, fifteen minutes being ample time for the first part of the process. It is whiter and looks more inviting than that made with hops. It keeps well two weeks, and makes delicious bread.</p><p><variation>This receipt can be varied by using boiling hop-water.

The name "biscuit" is from the French, and means "twice baked." It was originally applied to a kind of hard, thin bread, made in that manner to deprive it of all moisture and insure its remaining in good condition for a long time. It was something like our crackers and ship bread. But in America it means any kind of bread made into small, round cakes and intended to be eaten hot or fresh. <emph rend="italic">Raised biscuit</emph> may be made from any of the doughs made
 
<pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=89"/>

by the receipts for bread; the proportions are enough for one pan of bread, and one pan of biscuit containing twelve or sixteen according to the size. They should always be made small, and shaped with the fingers, not cut with a cutter. Divide the portion of dough reserved for biscuit into halves, then into quarters, and each quarter into thirds or quarters. <emph rend="italic">To shape a biscuit,</emph> take one of these quarters in the left hand and rest it lightly on the board. With the right thumb and forefinger draw a point of the dough up and over to the centre, and hold it down with the left thumb. Give the dough a slight turn toward the left, and repeat the drawing up and folding over until you have been all round the ball. You may roll them in the hands until all these foldings have disappeared and they are smooth and round, and call them simply <emph rend="italic">biscuit;</emph> <variation>or you may make the folds as distinct as possible, and place them at once in the pan. The folds will spread apart in rising, and when baked they can be peeled off in layers. They are then honored with the name of <purpose rend="italic">Imperial Rolls.</purpose>

</variation> Put the biscuit in a shallow round pan, fitting them closely, that they may rise up, round and puffy, instead of spreading.

<ingredient>Bread</ingredient> is toasted, or dried and browned, before the fire to extract the moisture and make it more palatable and digestible. If the slices be cut thick and carelessly exposed to a blazing fire, the outside is blackened and made into charcoal before the heat can reach the inside; the moisture is only heated, not evaporated, making the inside doughy or clammy, and when spread with butter, which cannot penetrate the charcoal, but floats on the surface in the form of oil, it forms one of the most indigestible compounds. The correct way is to have the bread stale, and cut into thin, uniform slices about one quarter of an inch thick. The fire should be clear, red (not blazing) coals. The crusts may be removed or not according to your taste, or the purpose for which the toast is intended. If you require only one or two slices, a toasting-fork will

answer; but if a larger quantity be needed, there is nothing better than a <implement>double broiler</implement> with wires about a third of an inch apart. Place the slices evenly on one side of the <implement>broiler,</implement> being careful not to put in more than can be equally exposed to the fire; close the <implement>broiler</implement> and hold it firmly, that the slices may not slip; move it gently over the fire for one or two minutes; then turn it over, that all the moisture may be drawn out; hold it nearer to the coals, and color it a delicate golden-brown. Serve at once in a <implement>toast rack</implement> or piled lightly, that it may not lose its crispness. Butter before serving, or send it dry to the table. Bread properly dried and toasted is changed from the nature of dough, which always has a tendency to sour on the stomach, into pure wheat farina. It is not so scorched as to turn the butter into oil, but absorbs the butter; and butter and farina, being easily separated, are quickly acted upon by the gastric fluid. Many persons prefer toast that is soft inside, but it should never be served to sick people in that manner. It is better to have it dry, and then moistened with milk or water, than to have it doughy. If the bread be freshly baked and you <emph rend="italic">must</emph> make toast, dry the slices in a warm oven before toasting. Always toast over the coals, or in the over.

<hd align="center" size="larger">SODA BISCUIT, MUFFINS, GEMS, ETC.</hd>
<p>THE soda now used in cooking is the bicarbonate of soda,--an alkali made from the ashes of marine plants, or, more recently, from sea salt. <emph rend="italic">Crude soda</emph> is known as <emph rend="italic">sal-soda,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">soda-saleratus;</emph> when refined and cleared of its impurities, it is carbonate and bicarbonate of soda, the latter having twice as much carbonic acid gas as the carbonate. <emph rend="italic">Potash</emph> is another fixed alkali made from wood ashes. <emph rend="italic">Pearlash</emph> is purified potash. <emph rend="italic">Saleratus</emph> is prepared from pearlash by exposing it to carbonic acid gas.</p><p>Pure, strong alkalies are powerful corrosive poisons, eating the coats of the stomach perhaps quicker than any other poisonous agent. This caustic or burning property is somewhat weakened by the carbonic acid united with them, and is therefore less in bicarbonate of soda than in the potash compounds. The latter are now seldom used. Alkalies when properly combined with acids lose this poisonous property; the carbonic acid gas is liberated, and the compound formed by this union is called a neutral salt, being neither acid nor alkaline. When not properly combined, if the acid be stronger than the alkali, the salt is acid; and if the alkali be in excess, the salt is alkaline and still poisonous.</p><p>Soda has a great affinity for water; and when wet, a combination takes place which allows some of the carbonic acid gas to escape. This may easily be seen by the effervescence which occurs when soda is dissolved in hot water. This, the old way of using soda, was theoretically wrong, as much of the gas was lost; yet practically good results were obtained, because the saleratus formerly used was much stronger than the bicarbonate of soda of to-day, and could well be weakened.</p>
 
<pb n="81" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=101"/>

<p>Soda alone, when mixed with wet dough, will give off gas enough to raise the dough; but it leaves a strong alkaline taste and a greenish yellow color, and, being poisonous, must be neutralized by an acid, or else its use is not admissible. The best acid for this purpose is one which does not liberate the gas instantly on contact with the soda, before the heat can fix the air cells, and also the one which leaves no unwholesome residue.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Mariatic Acid,</emph> which is sometimes used, would be the best, as it leaves only common salt as a residue; but the gas is liberated instantly, and only a skilled hand can mix the bread and place it in the oven without losing much of the gas.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cream of Tartar,</emph> which is tartaric acid combined with potash, and is obtained from the crystals or argols which collect in <implement>wine casks,</implement> is preferred by chemists. Being only slightly soluble in cold water, it unites with soda only when heated, and the gas is not all liberated until the mixture is in the oven. The residue from the union is Rochelle salt, which is not injurious taken <emph rend="italic">occasionally</emph> in small quantities. The objections to cream of tartar are these: being very expensive (the price varying with the grape crop), it is often adulterated with alum and other harmful substances; and the proportions of soda and cream of tartar are often guessed at instead of being accurately measured. The only safe way to use these chemicals is to purchase cream of tartar of a reliable chemist, and to measure carefully <emph rend="italic">one level teaspoonful of soda to two full teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar</emph> for <emph rend="italic">one quart of flour.</emph> It takes a trifle more than twice the quantity of cream of tartar to make the reaction complete. The soda <emph rend="italic">must</emph> be finely pulverized before measuring; rub it on the board with a knife, measure, and then sift through the finest wire strainer into the flour. Sifting with the flour through an ordinary flour sieve is <emph rend="italic">not</emph> enough. Cream of tartar does not become lumpy like soda; but it is better to sift it, and salt also, into the flour, and then sift all together two or three times.

food than a spot of soda, even if it be but the size of a pin-head, and no one should excuse such negligence.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Baking-Powders.</emph>--When your druggist or cook is not to be relied upon, use a baking-powder which has been tested and proved pure. Pure baking-powders are soda and cream of tartar mixed by weight in the proper proportion, and combined with rice flour, cornstarch, or some harmless ingredient to insure their keeping. To allow for this starch the measure should be a little more than the combined amount of soda and cream of tartar; <emph rend="italic">three rounding teaspoonfuls of baking-powder</emph> being equal to one level teaspoonful of soda and two full teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. <emph rend="italic">One even teaspoonful of baking-powder</emph> for <emph rend="italic">each cup of flour</emph> is a convenient formula.</p><p>Soda is also neutralized by <emph rend="italic">sour milk</emph> or <emph rend="italic">lactic acid.</emph> This is economical, particularly for those who have pure milk and more than they can use while it is sweet. But milk is often adulterated, and, in winter, grows bitter before it sours; and the degree of acidity varies so much that the result is often failure. Sour milk is best when it sours quickly, and is thick and smooth, not separated. <emph rend="italic">One even teaspoonful </emph> of soda to <emph rend="italic">one pint of nicely thickened</emph> or <emph rend="italic">loppered milk</emph> is the proportion. When the milk tastes or smells sour, but is not thick, use it as sweet milk in gingerbread or brown bread, where you have molasses to complete the acidity. Add a very little more soda if the receipt call for sweet milk, or a little less if for sour milk.</p><p>Nearly all kinds of soda biscuit, muffins, gems, etc., should have the dry ingredients mixed in one bowl, and the liquids, such as milk, eggs, melted butter, etc., in another; and when ready to bake, stir the two quickly and thoroughly together, and bake immediately in a very hot oven.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Molasses</emph> gives another acid which is combined with soda, to raise and lighten dough. Directions for its use are given under rules for brown bread and molasses gingerbread.</p>

<p>The names pancakes, fritters, flap-jacks, slap-jacks, batter-cakes, griddle-cakes, slappers, etc., are applied indiscriminately in different localities.</p><p>Pancakes were formerly a kind of muffin mixture, made a little stiffer than a drop batter, but not stiff enough to roll out, and were dropped from a spoon into hot fat, and fried like doughnuts. But, recently, the name has been applied to a very thin batter made usually without soda, cooked one cake at a time on a small well-buttered frying-pan, and turned like a griddle-cake; then buttered, and rolled over and over, or spread with sugar and jelly, and then rolled. In "ye olden time" good cooks were supposed to have the knack of tossing the pan so skilfully that the cake would turn over itself; but this is now one of the lost arts.</p><p>For convenience and clearness, the following names will be used in this work:--</p><p><emph rend="italic">Griddle-Cakes:</emph> any kind of small, thin batter-cakes cooked on a griddle.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Pancakes:</emph> larger, thin batter-cakes, made without soda, and cooked in a small frying-pan.</p><p><emph rend="italic">French</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Rolled Pancakes:</emph> the same as the preceding, buttered, sweetened, and rolled.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fried Drop Cakes</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Fried Muffins:</emph> any muffin mixture, dropped from a spoon into deep hot fat.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fritters:</emph> a thinner mixture made without soda, either plain or with meat, fish, or fruit, and cooked by dropping into deep hot fat.</p></section>

<p>A <implement>waffle iron</implement> is made of two corrugated iron griddles fitted and fastened together at one side with a hinge, and revolving in an iron frame, which is to be placed over the fire. It may be either circular or oblong. Each griddle is divided into compartments, which are usually grooved into diamonds, hearts, rounds, etc.</p><p>The iron should be placed over the fire, heated on each side, and greased thoroughly, as it is very hard to clean if the cakes stick. Put a piece of salt pork on a fork, or put a small piece of butter in a clean cloth, and rub all over both griddles. The heat will melt the butter and let just enough of it go through the cloth. This is better than to put it on with a knife. Close the griddles and turn them; this causes the fat to run evenly over them. Open, and pour the waffle mixture into the centre of the half over the fire, or put a spoonful in each compartment, filling them about two thirds full. Cover, and cook one minute on one side, then turn and cook a little longer on the other. Any kind of griddle-cake mixture, with the addition of the melted butter to make them crisp, may be cooked on a <implement>waffle-iron,</implement> if one cares to take the extra trouble.</p></section>

<hd align="center">To Cook Griddle-Cakes.</hd>
<p>A <implement>soapstone griddle,</implement> which needs no greasing, is the best; but of whatever material, let it be large enough to hold seven cakes. Let it heat while you are making the cakes. If an iron griddle be used, put a piece of salt pork two inches square on a fork; and when the griddle is hot enough for the fat to sizzle, rub it all over with the pork. Just grease it; do not leave little pools of fat on the edge to burn, and smoke the cakes. Take up a tablespoonful of the mixture, and pour it from the end of the spoon. The mixture should hiss or sizzle as it touches the griddle. Put one in the centre and six around the outside. By the time you have the seventh cake on, the first one will be full of bubbles and ready to turn; and when the seventh is turned, the first will have stopped puffing and be done. Wipe the griddle with a dry cloth, and grease again after each baking. Turn your griddle often, bringing each edge of it in turn over the hottest part of the stove, that the cakes may cook evenly. Always mix waffles or griddle-cakes in a bowl with a lip, and beat up the mixture well between each baking.</p></section>

<p>The fat for fried cakes should be clean, new fat, half lard and half clarified beef drippings. By new fat is meant fat that has not been used for meat or fish, or become browned by previous frying. The same fat may be used several times by clarifying with several thin slices of raw potato, and straining through a fine strainer after each frying. When it becomes too brown for any

flour mixtures, it will answer for croquettes or fish balls. It should be very hot, and still, not bubbling; but not as hot as for mixtures which have been previously cooked. The surest way is to fry a bit of the mixture. It should rise at once to the surface, with much spluttering of the fat, swell, and begin to brown on the under side. Drop cakes will usually turn over themselves, but doughnuts and fritters should be turned. They should be cooked an even golden brown, and the fat be kept at the right temperature by moving the kettle farther from or nearer to the fire. Try them with a fork, and if it come out clean, they are done.</p><p>Drain each cake over the hot fat, and when they cease to drip, put them in a <implement>squash strainer</implement> placed in a pan on the back of the stove, or drain on soft brown paper. Change the first cooked to another pan when the next are ready to be taken out. If the fat be not hot enough, or if there be too much soda, doughnuts will absorb the fat. The alkali in them unites with the grease, as it does in making soap. The eggs will prevent the cakes from soaking in the fat, and it is healthful and more economical to use them.</p></section>

<p><emph rend="italic">Oatmeal</emph> is highly nutritious, being richer in nitrogen than any other grain; but as it does not contain a tough, adhesive gluten, like wheat, it is not easily made into fermented bread. Its nitrogenous matter resembles casein more than gluten, and is called <emph rend="italic">avenin</emph> (from <emph rend="italic">avena,</emph> the oat). It is used as a mush or porridge, eaten with sugar and milk. It is rich in food for muscle and brain, useful for children and laboring people, but irritating to many people whose digestive powers are weak.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Groats,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Grits,</emph> are oats from which the outer husk and inner flinty cuticle are removed.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Indian Corn</emph> is used in many forms. Some varieties which contain a large proportion of sugar, are eaten green from the cob as a vegetable. The whole grains, hulled, are eaten as samp; broken grains of various sizes, as hominy; the ground grains, as either coarse or fine meal. Meal grows musty very quickly when ground by the old process, owing to the moisture of the corn and the heat of the stones. In the new-process, or granulated, meal the corn is first dried for two years, then ground into coarse grains like sugar. Indian corn is also used in the form of a very fine powder, called cornstarch. Corn meal, when cooked, is best made into small loaves or cakes and eaten hot. It is rich in nitrogen, and contains more fat than the other grains. This causes it to attract the oxygen from the air, and spoil rapidly. It should be purchased in small quantities. It is better adapted to strong laboring people, as it is very heating for persons with weak digestion.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">Rye</emph> meal and flour are used, more especially in New England, in the form of bread and mush.

It cannot be made into good bread, as it has too little gluten. It is nutritious, being rich in phosphates. It contains starch and mucilage, and, in the form of gruel, makes a soothing drink in fevers. The husk is removed, the grains are ground and polished, and then it is termed <emph rend="italic">pearl barley.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Buckwheat</emph> has less flesh-forming, and more heat-giving elements than wheat. It is therefore suitable only when used in cold weather and by those who labor hard or exercise freely.

<recipe class1="beverages"><p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Tea.</purpose>

THERE are three varieties of the tea-plant; both black and green tea can be prepared from them all. Green tea is made from young leaves steamed, roasted, and dried quickly on copper plates. Black tea is made from leaves which have been exposed to the air ten or twelve hours before roasting. The action of the air upon the leaves during this long exposure causes the dark color. Green tea gives up less of its juices in drying, and this accounts for its energetic action on the nervous system.</p><p>The tea-leaf contains the largest amount of nutritive matter of any plant used as human food, though only a small portion of it is extracted by our common method of making tea. There is a large proportion of casein in the leaves. Many of the savage tribes of Tartary boil the leaves with soda, and eat them with salt and butter. But in our method of using tea as a beverage merely, we use such a comparatively small quantity that the amount of nutriment is very little; its chief value being the sense of warmth and comfort that it gives. It excites the brain to increased activity, and produces wakefulness; hence it is useful to students and night-workers. It retards the action of the natural functions, causes less waste, and, to a certain extent, saves food. For this reason, when not used in excess, it is suited to poor people, whose supplies of substantial food are scanty; and to old persons, whose powers of digestion and whose bodily substance have begun to fail. It should not be used early in the morning, as the body needs immediate nourishment in a larger quantity; and it should at all times be taken moderately, both as to quantity and strength.</p>
 
<pb n="112" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=132"/>

<p>The water should be freshly boiled. Scald and heat the teapot, which should be of earthen or china, <emph rend="italic">never</emph> of tin. Allow <emph rend="italic">one teaspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">tea</ingredient> for <emph rend="italic">one cup</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">boiling water.</ingredient> Reduce the proportion of tea when several cups are required. Put the tea in a strainer, pour through it <emph rend="italic">half a cup</emph> of <emph rend="italic">boiling water</emph> to cleanse the grounds. Then put the tea in the teapot; pour on the <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water; cover closely and place it where it will keep hot, but not boil, for five minutes. If cold or lukewarm water be used in making tea, the <emph rend="italic">thein,</emph> or nitrogenous substance, will not be obtained.</p><p>In boiling tea or allowing the leaves to remain long in the tea, by repeated steeping, the fragrant aroma is wasted and the tannin is extracted, which may cause gastric disorders to those who drink it. Never make tea in a tin teapot, as the tannic acid acts upon the metal and produces a poisonous compound.</p><p><emph rend="italic">A slice</emph> of <emph rend="italic">lemon</emph> is a good substitute for milk in tea. The lemon prevents the headache and sleeplessness which the tea causes in some persons.</p><p>A French chemist recommends grinding tea like coffee.

<recipe class1="beverages"><p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Iced Tea, or Russian Tea.</purpose>

Make the tea by the first receipt, strain it from the grounds, and keep it cool. When ready to serve, put <emph rend="italic">two cubes</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">block sugar</ingredient> in a glass, <emph rend="italic">half fill</emph> with <ingredient rend="italic">broken ice,</ingredient> add <emph rend="italic">a slice</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">lemon,</ingredient> and fill the glass with <ingredient rend="italic">cold tea.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<recipe class1="beverages"><p><purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">Coffee.</purpose>

Coffee grows on small trees. Mocha, the best variety, is grown in Arabia. Other choice kinds come from Java, the West Indies, and South America. The fruit of the coffee tree is something like the cherry, and contains two seeds or beans. Bruising the fruit separates the berries,<pb n="113" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=133"/>

which are then washed and dried. The raw berries are tough, difficult to grind, and have but little flavor. Coffee should be roasted and kept in air-tight cans, that the fine flavor may be perfectly developed and preserved. Coffee is more stimulating than tea, and, when taken very strong after a hearty meal, aids digestion. It should be made in such a way that the full strength and aroma are obtained, without developing the tannic acid. This is done by pouring boiling water upon the coffee and keeping it in a closely covered vessel just below the boiling point, or boiling not longer than five minutes. If allowed to boil longer, or left uncovered, the volatile oil which forms the fragrant aroma is dissipated, and the tannic acid extracted. This acid, when combined with cream or milk, forms a leathery, indigestible compound which irritates the internal membranes.</p><p>The proportion of one third Mocha and two thirds Java coffee is agreeable to most people.

<hd align="center" size="larger">SOUP.</hd>
<p>NOTHING can be easier than to make a good soup if one only <emph rend="italic">knows how</emph> and has the <emph rend="italic">will</emph> to do it; and if one will, it is easy to know how. Considerations of economy and healthfulness make it the duty of every house-keeper to thoroughly inform herself on the few essential points in soup-making. When these are learned it will be as simple as any other duty.</p><p>As soups are <emph rend="italic">not</emph> made from <emph rend="italic">nothing,</emph> a supply of materials should always be kept on hand, such as <emph rend="italic">dried sweet herbs</emph> (which may be purchased at any city market for a trifle; twenty-five cents' worth will last a year or more); also <emph rend="italic">whole,</emph> as well as <emph rend="italic">ground spices;</emph> and, more particularly, fresh vegetables,--<emph rend="italic">onions, carrots,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">turnips.</emph> If we had access to the French market, we could buy the smallest amount whenever it might be desired; but as only a few marketmen in America will sell a single onion or a single carrot, it is well for those who cannot cultivate for themselves to purchase in large quantities. They may be kept in a cool place by covering with clean sand. <emph rend="italic">Parsley</emph> may be grown in the house if you have a sunny window; and we can all have salt and pepper. Now, having these seasoning materials always at hand, you may easily find other material in the store-room, or from the day's supply of fresh meat, fish, etc., without buying expressly for soup; that is, if you, instead of the marketman, have the bones and trimmings.</p><p>Every pantry should have a "catch all." It is vastly more important there than in the sewing-room or on the toilet-table. The <implement>coal-hod,</implement> refuse pail, and sink <emph rend="italic">catch all</emph> in many households. One or two large bowls--not tin, but deep earthen dishes, provided they are sweet and do
 
<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=140"/>

not leak--will better answer the purpose. After breakfast or dinner, do not put away the remnants of steaks or roasts on the platters, but look them over and put by themselves any pieces that can be used again, either cold or in what are called <emph rend="italic">made dishes.</emph> Then put all the bones, trimmings, fat, gristle, and everything, especially the platter gravy, which usually flavors the dish-water, into the "catch all." If you have just one bone from a steak or chop, if it be not burned it is worth saving, and in cool weather will keep till you have another. If there be a tablespoonful of any vegetables, a stalk of celery, an egg, baked apple, or a bit of macaroni, put them away neatly. You will find a use for them. If you have boiled a fresh tongue, a fowl, a leg of lamb, or a cup of rice, plan to make a soup also, and thus save the water. This economy may be carried to the extreme of saving the water in which cabbages, beans, or potatoes have been boiled, or of keeping a fire several hours in a hot day only to save a few cents' worth of bone, or of spoiling all the soup by adding a spoonful of turnip already sour; but as a rule we err in the opposite practice.</p><p>Soups are made from meat, fish, and vegetables, with water or milk; seasoned or flavored with any or every kind of vegetable, sweet herbs, spices, curry powder, catchups, aromatic sauces, and with some kinds of fruit. They are served thin and clear, or thickened with vegetables or cereals, and with or without meat.</p><p>Soups are classified and named in various ways, according to material, color, quality, etc. Soups <emph rend="italic">with stock</emph> have meat as the basis. Soups <emph rend="italic">without stock</emph> are made of fish, vegetables, and milk. They are sometimes called <emph rend="italic">soup maigre.</emph> Soups are named from the principal ingredient, or an imitation of the same, as Potato, Onion, Beef, Mutton, Chicken, Gumbo, Macaroni, Okra, Ox-tail, Giblet, Cock-a-leekie, Lobster, Mock Turtle, Mock Bisque, etc.; or from the color, as Clear, or Amber, Brown, and White; or from the consistency, as Thin soups and Pur&#233;es; or from the quality, as simple Broths, Bouillon, and Consomm&#233;;

or from the season of the year, as Julienne; or from the people who use them, as Scotch Broth, French Pot-au-feu, Indian Mullagatawney; or from the name of the makers, or in any way one's fancy and invention may suggest. But from the scores, yes, hundreds of receipts in the cook-books, which seem so bewildering to the beginner, a few simple rules may be deduced which will make the process of soup-making intelligible; and when once the foundation is laid, you may build and enlarge as you choose.</p><p>Do not be discouraged because you have not all the dozen or more ingredients mentioned in most receipts. You will find many of them may be omitted with a perfectly satisfactory result. Much depends upon <emph rend="italic">what</emph> is omitted, though, as Potage &#224; la Reine without chicken, or Julienne without vegetables, or Mullagatawney without curry powder, would disappoint those who think only of the name; but, called by any other name, you would find them very good soups.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Soups with Stock.</hd>
<p>Soups made with stock include all the varieties made from beef, veal, mutton, and poultry. Perhaps a glance at the meaning of the word <emph rend="italic">stock</emph> will make clear its application to cookery. Stock is from the Anglo-Saxon <emph rend="italic">stician,</emph> to stick, and the idea of fixedness is expressed in all its forms. Stock in trade or business means the money or material laid by, or <emph rend="italic">stored, stocked, fixed,</emph> as a source of supply, ready for use at any time; and in the business of soup-making, stock is the material <emph rend="italic">stored</emph> or prepared in such a way that it may be kept or fixed for use in making different kinds of meat soup; or, more definitely, it is a liquid containing the juices and soluble parts of meat, bone, and vegetables, which have been extracted by proper cooking. This liquid is more or less solid when cold, according to the gelatinous nature of the ingredients. It varies greatly in quality, owing to the manner in which it is prepared and the material used.</p>
 
<pb n="122" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=142"/>

<recipe class1="soups"><p><purpose>Stock</purpose>

is usually made from the cheaper, inferior parts of meat, which yield the most nutriment when cooked in this way; also from odds and ends of cooked meat, which perhaps could not be used otherwise. The chief object in making stock is to obtain in the quickest manner the largest possible amount of nutriment from the cheapest parts of meat, and after getting it to keep and use it. This is best accomplished by observing the following rules:--</p><p><emph rend="italic">First.</emph> Cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> into small pieces, and soak them in <ingredient><emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water</ingredient> before heating, that every atom of nourishment may be extracted. Cold water draws out and dissolves the meat juices, while hot water hardens the albumen on the outside of the meat and prevents the juices from escaping into the liquid.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Second.</emph> Use a careful selection and proportion of meat, <ingredient>bone,</ingredient> and water, and season judiciously, so that no one flavor will predominate.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Third.</emph> Use a steam-tight kettle, and <emph rend="italic">simmer,</emph>--not boil the material rapidly,--that the juices may be retained in the water, and not wasted by evaporation.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fourth.</emph> Make stock the day before using, if possible, that the fat may be more easily removed; but do not give up making it simply from "lack of time," for it <emph rend="italic">can</emph> be made quickly.</p><p>A <implement rend="italic">soup digester</implement> is the proper vessel for making stock. This is a porcelain-lined iron kettle with a bale, and having a cover fitting closely into a groove, so that no steam can escape except from the valve in the top of the cover, which at once indicates when the water is boiling rapidly. One holding six quarts, and costing three dollars, is a convenient size for a small family. If you cannot afford a <implement>digester,</implement> get a granite ironware kettle, with a tightly fitting cover. Plain ironware will do if you have nothing better; but it rusts easily, and, if tin-lined, the tin melts in careless usage.</p><p>The meats used in making stock should contain <emph rend="italic">gelatine, osmazome,</emph> and a small amount of <emph rend="italic">fat.</emph></p>
 
<pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=143"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Gelatine</emph> is found in the bones, skin, tendinous and gristly portions of flesh, especially in veal. It is this which causes the stock to become a jelly. But a soup which forms a jelly, or is made principally from bones, is not the most nutritious. The jelly of bones and sinews boiled into soup can furnish only jelly for our bones and sinews. It is useful in convalescence, for then the portions of the system in which gelatine is needed have been wasted; but in other cases, though easily digested, it is unwholesome, for it loads the blood with disturbing products. It is entirely destitute of flavor, and therefore we need with it meat containing <emph rend="italic">osmazome.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Osmazome</emph> is that part of meat which gives to each of the various kinds its distinctive flavor. It is more abundant in brown than in white meats, and in the meat of old rather than in that of young animals. It is found largely in lean beef, mutton, and fowls. Osmazome is more highly developed in roasted meats; therefore all the bones and remnants of roasts which cannot be utilized in <emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es,</emph> should be put into the <implement>soup-kettle.</implement></p><p>We need also the <emph rend="italic">alkaline</emph> and <emph rend="italic">acid salts</emph> found in the blood and juices of the flesh; therefore a small portion of <emph rend="italic">raw, lean meat</emph> should form a part of all stock.</p><p><ingredient rend="italic">Fat</ingredient> is necessary, as an element of perfect food, and should always be used in making stock. It adds to the flavor, and all that is not absorbed in the stock may be removed when cold. The <ingredient rend="italic">marrow,</ingredient> found in the shin bone, is the best form of fat. The <ingredient>browned fat of roast beef</ingredient> gives a fine flavor, and occasionally a bit of <ingredient>ham</ingredient> or <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> may be used. But all mutton fat should be avoided, because of its rankness.</p><p>These four kinds of meat--<ingredient>beef,</ingredient> <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> and <ingredient>poultry</ingredient>--may be used together or separately. It is better to use mutton, if in a large quantity, by itself, as the flavor is disagreeable to many. After having extracted all the nutriment from the meat in its juices, fat, albumen, and flavor, do not attempt to make further use of the worthless residue of muscular fibre. It is not only harmful, but dry, 
 
<pb n="124" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=144"/>

tasteless, and utterly useless as food. It needs the addition of many other materials to make it palatable even, and it is cheaper to get the fibrine we need from meat cooked in other ways, directions for which will be given under Boiling Meats and Stews. Therefore do not hesitate, as a matter of economy, to throw away this useless meat.</p><p>When fresh meat is bought expressly for stock, select a piece from the shin or lower part of the round of beef or veal. This has bone with marrow, a large proportion of gelatine, more or less osmazome, according to the amount of flesh, and costs less than other parts. In mutton, pieces from the neck and forequarter are the best. Fowls are better than chickens. With this fresh meat may be used the bones and trimmings from steak or chops, and the flank ends of roasting pieces, which yield more nutriment if added to the <implement>stock pot</implement> before being cooked. Add also any remnants of roasted or broiled meat, bone, fat, gristle, anything except mutton fat. In families where large roasts of beef and poultry are often used, there should be material enough for stock, without buying new meat, except for the nicest of clear soups, which the French call Consomm&#233;.</p><p>The proportions of bone and meat should be about equal by weight. When ready to begin the stock, wipe the fresh meat with a clean cloth wet in cold water. Never put the meat in a pan of cold water to soak. It takes out all the juices that you wish to save. <emph rend="italic">Wipe before cutting.</emph> The inside is clean. But rinse the cloth and scrub the <emph rend="italic">outside</emph> thoroughly. Cut away the parts that are tainted or discolored by rusty meat-hooks, etc. Examine all the odds and ends of cooked meat, and remove any smoked or burned parts from ham or broiled meat, also the stuffing and skin from roast poultry, if you wish to have the stock clear. Scrape the meat clean from the bones and cut into inch pieces. Break or saw the bones as small as you conveniently can. Remove the marrow (a soft, fatty substance, which you will find in the hollow of the bones) and put it in the <implement>soup kettle</implement> to keep the bones from sticking.
 
<pb n="125" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=145"/>

Put in the bones and pack the meat around them. Place your kettle on the back of the range before adding the water, so that there need be no heavy weight to lift. Allow one quart of fresh cold water to every pound of meat and bone; one fourth less water if your stock is to be made altogether of cooked meats, or if you use a <implement>digester.</implement> Cover the kettle, and after the water is quite red, and the juices are well drawn out, draw the kettle forward and let it heat slowly, and <emph rend="italic">simmer,</emph> or boil slowly, but <emph rend="italic">never boil hard.</emph></p><p>The scum, which soon rises on the surface, is the albumen and juices of the meat which have been drawn out and mixed with the cold water. They coagulate, or harden, as the water heats, and, being lighter than the water, rise to the surface in the form of scum. It has usually been considered essential, in making soup, to remove every particle of this scum; but the practice is wholly unnecessary and wasteful. We learn, in the article on Boiling, the three distinct purposes and methods of cooking meat in water; and yet in skimming a soup we act directly contrary to the general principle there explained. If the kettle be clean, the water pure, and the meat well cleansed from any impurities on its outer surface, what can there be in the meat not suitable to eat, any more than in roast beef, or steak, or boiled mutton? In making beef tea we are directed by the highest scientific authorities to remove the fat, cut the meat small, soak it in cold water, heat gradually, and never skim, as the scum or thickened material in the water is the very thing desired. Soup is only another form of beef tea, and the fat which is objectionable can better be removed when the stock is cold. These juices and soluble parts of the meat should be retained; they increase, rather than diminish, the flavor, and all the sediment which is fine enough to go through the strainer should be used. In any thickened soup it is so mingled with the other ingredients as not to be unpleasant to the eye. And for those who wish clear soups, which are <emph rend="italic">not</emph> as nutritious, this sediment can easily be removed in the clearing.</p>

The French, who regard skimming as very important in making their <emph rend="italic">Pot-au-feu,</emph> remove the meat as soon as tender, and serve it as <emph rend="italic">bouilli,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">boiled beef.</emph> As it has not been cut in small pieces, and is heated quickly, some of the juices are retained in the meat, and it is nourishing and palatable. Their <emph rend="italic">Pot-au-feu</emph> is more like our beef stew than like soup stock.</p><p>In the preparation of the stock, the next step is to add the seasoning, which may be used in these proportions: For <emph rend="italic">every quart</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">water,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">one even teaspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">salt,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">two</emph> <ingredient rend="italic">peppercorns</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic">half a saltspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">ground pepper,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">two</emph> <ingredient rend="italic">cloves,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">two</emph> <ingredient rend="italic">allspice berries,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">one fourth</emph> of <emph rend="italic">a saltspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">celery seed</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic">a bit</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">celery root,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">a sprig</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">parsley,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">a teaspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">mixed herbs,</ingredient> and <emph rend="italic">a tablespoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">each vegetable.</ingredient></p><p>Herbs and spices are better whole than ground, as they may be more readily removed by straining. The French cooks use a bouquet of herbs, made with two leaves or blossoms of each herb wrapped in a sprig of parsley and tied securely so that it may be easily removed. A convenient and economical way is to strip off the leaves and blossoms, break the stalks in tiny pieces, mix them, and keep in a tin box. Use <ingredient rend="italic">sage,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">summer savory,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">thyme,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">marjoram,</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">bay leaves:</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">a teaspoonful</emph> of the <emph rend="italic">mixture</emph> (not of each herb) for <emph rend="italic">every quart.</emph> The vegetables generally used are <ingredient rend="italic">onion,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">carrot,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">turnip,</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">celery.</ingredient> It is better to omit them entirely in warm weather, or if you wish to keep the stock more than a week, as the vegetable juices ferment quickly and sour the stock.</p><p>Wash, scrape, or pare the vegetables; cut them into small pieces for convenience in measuring, as one onion or one slice of carrot is rather indefinite. Keep them in cold water until the juices are drawn from the meat.

When old or strong, they may be blanched or parboiled first.</p><p>Onions, <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> should always be scalded to draw out the indigestible qualities. Some object to the use of onions, particularly on account of the disagreeable odor; but when added with the other seasoning material, they are so completely absorbed in the stock that no trace of their presence can be detected. All or part of the vegetables may be fried first, if you like. One or two <ingredient>sour apples</ingredient> give a pleasant flavor to stock. <ingredient>Wines</ingredient> or <ingredient>catchups</ingredient> should be added just before serving, as boiling dissipates the flavor.</p><p><variation>If you wish to have a <purpose rend="italic">dark brown stock,</purpose>

reserve part of the lean meat to brown with the onions. Fry the onions in a little fat, and when very brown remove them, to prevent burning, and brown the meat in the same fat. Add the onions and meat to the stock. Take a little water from the stock, and wash off all the browned glaze adhering to the frying-pan, as this is the best part. A tablespoonful of <ingredient>browned sugar</ingredient> or <ingredient rend="italic">caramel</ingredient> (see <ref target="linc154.jpg">page 134</ref>), which should always be kept on hand, will also give a rich dark color.</variation> After the seasoning is placed in the mixture, put the kettle where it will keep at a gentle, steady simmering. Do not let it boil furiously one half-hour and not at all the next, but find the place on the range where it will keep at just the right temperature, and then, if you have a steady fire, it will need no further attention until ready to strain. It is hot enough if the water just bubbles on one side of the kettle.</p><p>When the stock has simmered till the meat is in rags and the bones clean, strain at once. Do not let it stand, if in an iron kettle. If you have used a <implement>digester</implement> or steam-tight kettle, the water will not have lessened much. If boiled in an ordinary kettle, it will be reduced about one half by evaporation, and may be diluted when ready for the table. Strain in this way. Place a stone jar beside your kettle. It should be of a size suited to the amount of stock. Put a <implement>colander</implement> over the jar (it should fit inside
 
<pb n="128" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=148"/>

it), and a <implement>strainer cloth</implement> over the <implement>colander.</implement> Then, with a ladle or dipper, dip the contents of the kettle and pour into the strainer. Never try to lift the kettle and pour it out, unless you have more strength and skill than most beginners. When you have only a pint left, you may try the pouring. Do not squeeze the cloth, but let the contents drain ten or fifteen minutes, then throw the scraps away. Remember that you have extracted all the nutriment, and have it in the water; so do not expect to have any virtue in the meat or vegetables. Set the jar in a cool place, uncovered, but not in the <implement>ice chest</implement> while hot. It keeps better to cool quickly. In cold weather, and if you have used a large proportion of bone, the stock will harden like jelly, with a cake of solid fat on the top. This fat, by excluding the air, helps to keep the stock, and should not be removed until the stock is needed. In winter stock will keep a week, and longer, if made without vegetables. It should be heated occasionally to the boiling-point, or after taking off any portion of it, that what remains may harden again in an unbroken form. A little fresh charcoal tied in a bag and boiled with the stock is said to restore it when only slightly changed.</p><p>In very warm weather, make only enough for each day, as sometimes it spoils in one night. If you wish to make a soup while the stock is still hot, put what portion you may need into a shallow pan and place the pan in ice water, with a larger pan of ice water over it. This will soon harden the fat; or if you have not time to do this, take off what fat you can with a spoon, and wipe off the remainder with soft tissue paper, or strain several times through a fine napkin. The grease will adhere to the napkin, which should be rinsed in cold water. That hardens the fat. Or you may let the soup boil gently, and nearly all can be taken off.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To remove the fat</emph> after the stock has jellied, run a knife around between the cake of fat and the jar. If the fat be solid, it will sometimes come off whole; but if soft, take off all you can without cutting into the jelly, then wring
 
<pb n="129" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=149"/>

a cloth out of very hot water, and wipe the stock. The hot cloth will absorb the fat readily. Remember, if the soup is to be served clear, not a pin-head of fat must be left; but if it is to be thickened with any starchy material, this will absorb what cannot be removed with a spoon. This fat must be saved and clarified according to directions on page 18.</p><p>With this stock for a foundation, you may make an endless variety of soups, each soup taking its name from the principal solid ingredient; and it is equally valuable to use, instead of water, in making gravies or sauces. No matter how little you have, one cupful is worth more than it costs to make it, as an addition to fricassees and braised meats. This stock, if properly made and strained, will be sufficiently clear for any common soups. But for clear sparkling soups and aspic jelly, it must be clarified with the white of an egg.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="soups"><p><purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">To clear Soup Stock.</purpose>

Remove the fat, and allow the <ingredient><emph rend="italic">white</emph> and <emph rend="italic">shell</emph> of <emph rend="italic">one egg</emph></ingredient> for <emph rend="italic">every quart</emph> of stock. If you wish to flavor the stock more highly, add <emph rend="italic">half a saltspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">celery seed</ingredient> and the <emph rend="italic">thinnest</emph> possible <emph rend="italic">shavings</emph> from the <ingredient><emph rend="italic">rind</emph> of <emph rend="italic">half a lemon.</emph></ingredient> Add also the <ingredient>lemon juice,</ingredient> and more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> if needed. Mix celery seed, lemon, egg, etc. with the <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> stock, and beat it well. If the stock be hot when the egg is added, the egg will harden before it has done its work. This is a point where many fail. Set it over the fire and stir it all the time, until it is hot, to keep the egg from settling. Then leave it, and let it boil ten minutes. By this time a thick scum will have formed, and as it breaks the liquid will be clear and sparkling, like wine, and darker than before. Draw it back on the stove, and add half a cup of cold water. Let it stand ten minutes, while you get your jar, <implement>colander,</implement> and fine napkin ready for straining. Wring your napkin out of hot water, and lay it over the <implement>colander.</implement> Put the finest wire strainer on the napkin and then pour it all through. This strainer will catch the scum
 
<pb n="130" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=150"/>

and shells which would otherwise clog the napkin. Let it take its own time to drain; but if you must hasten it, raise the napkin first at one corner, and then at another, and let the liquid run down to a clean place. This is better than squeezing. This is all ready to serve as a clear soup by simply heating to the boiling-point. Serve with it, in the <implement>tureen,</implement> thin slices of <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> a glass of <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> <ingredient>yolks of hard-boiled eggs,</ingredient> or delicate flavored <ingredient>force-meat balls;</ingredient> or put on each plate a <ingredient>poached egg,</ingredient> or a spoonful of grated <ingredient>Parmesan cheese.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<p>In making soups from this stock, bear this fact in mind: Do not waste the stock by boiling in it any material which requires long boiling. Vegetables, rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, vermicelli, etc., should be cooked separately and then added to the stock, which should be brought to the boiling-point.</p><p>The following are some of the principal varieties. These soups are all supposed to have no meat served with them. The broth is clear and thin, and every particle of vegetable or cereal should be distinct, except in the soups called Mixed Vegetable and Tomato.</p><p>Concise rules for Common Brown Stock and Consomm&#233; are given for the benefit of those who do not need to read all the preliminary remarks.</p>

of a dark brown color. Add <emph rend="italic">one cup</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">boiling water;</ingredient> simmer ten minutes, and bottle when cool. This should always be kept on hand, as it is useful for many purposes. It gives a rich, dark color to soups, coffee, and jelly; is more wholesome than browned butter in sauces, and is delicious as a flavoring in custards and pudding sauces.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Glaze.</purpose>

Glaze is simply clear stock boiled down to one fourth of its original amount. Put two quarts of <ingredient>rich, strong stock</ingredient> into a saucepan, and boil it uncovered until reduced to one pint. It should have a gluey consistency, and will keep a month if put in a closely covered jar in a cool place. It is useful in browning meats which have not been colored by cooking, but which we wish to have the appearance of having been roasted or browned.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Thickening for Soups.</purpose>

Soups are thickened with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> <ingredient>cornstarch,</ingredient> or <ingredient>rice flour:</ingredient> one tablespoonful for a quart of soup,--heaping, if flour; scant, if rice flour or cornstarch. Flour is the cheapest, but cornstarch gives a smoother consistency. Mix the flour with a very little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> or <ingredient>milk</ingredient> until it is a smooth paste; then add more liquid, until it can be poured easily into the <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> soup. Remember to boil the soup fifteen or twenty minutes after the thickening is added, that there may be no raw taste of the flour. Where <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and flour are used, the butter is rubbed to a cream, mixed or braided with the flour, and then made into a paste with a little of the soup.</p><p>A better way is to put the butter in a small saucepan, and when melted and bubbling stir in the flour quickly, until smooth (be careful not to brown butter for any white soup); then add gradually about a cup of the hot soup, letting it boil and thicken as you add the soup. It should be thin enough to pour. In vegetable soups or pur&#233;es, as soon as the hot butter and flour are blended,
 
<pb n="136" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=156"/>

they may be stirred at once into the soup. This is what is meant in many of the receipts by thickening with butter and flour which have been cooked together. The hot butter cooks the flour more thoroughly than it can be cooked in any other way. <variation>When a <purpose>brown thickening</purpose>

is desired, as in Mock Turtle Soup, melt the butter and let it become as brown as it will without burning; then add all the flour at once and stir quickly, that every particle of it may be moistened in the hot butter; add the water or soup gradually.</variation></p><p>Flour that is browned while dry, either in the oven or over the fire, colors, but does not thicken. A certain amount of moisture, of either fat or water, is necessary with the heat to thoroughly swell the grains of starch in the flour. Thickened soups should be about the consistency of good cream.

against mutton in stews or broths. The strong, disagreeable flavor lies mostly in the skin. If this be removed together with the fat, it will repay one for the time and trouble. As this broth is not to be strained, it is always well to boil the bones separately. Care must be taken not to let the water boil away. This is a favorite dish among the Scotch. They often serve it with a larger proportion of vegetables. The carrots are sometimes grated, giving the broth a fine color, and sometimes the dice of meat are first browned in the butter. <ingredient>Rice</ingredient> may be used instead of barley. Scotch broth made after this receipt has been tested by a native Scotchman, and pronounced more like the "auld countree" than any other dish eaten in America.</p></recipe>

</p><p>When buying a fish for a chowder, have the head left on, but the skin removed; or if you have to depend upon yourself, remove the skin according to directions on page 161. Then begin at the tail and cut the fish from the bone on one side, keeping the knife as close as possible to the bone; remove the bone from the other side. Do not forget to take out the small bones near the head. Wipe the fish carefully with a damp cloth, cut it into pieces about two inches square, and put it away in a cool place. Break the bones and head, cover with cold water, and put them on to boil. Pare and slice the potatoes one eighth of an inch thick, using enough to make the same quantity by measurement as you have of fish. Soak them in cold water half an hour, and parboil or scald in boiling water five minutes; then pour off the water. Cut the pork into quarter-inch dice, and fry it in an <implement>omelet pan.</implement> Cut the onions into thin slices and fry them in the pork fat, being careful that it does not burn. Pour the fat through a strainer into the kettle, leaving the pork scraps and onions in the strainer. Put the sliced potatoes into the kettle; hold the strainer over the potatoes, and pour through it enough boiling water to cover them. This is easier than to fry in the kettle, and skim out the pork and onions,--which to a novice would be running the risk of burning the fat, cleaning the kettle, and beginning again. When the potatoes have boiled ten minutes, strain the water in which the bones were boiled, and pour it into the kettle. Add the salt and pepper, and when the chowder is boiling briskly, put in the fish, and set it back where it can simmer
 
<pb n="156" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=176"/>

ten minutes. Do not break the fish by stirring it. Add the butter and the hot milk. Split the crackers, put them in the <implement>tureen,</implement> and pour the chowder over them. Do not soak the crackers in cold water. Butter crackers will soften easily in the hot chowder. If you wish the broth thicker, stir in one cup of fine cracker crumbs, or one tablespoonful of flour cooked in one tablespoonful of butter. More milk and a little more seasoning may be added to this amount of fish and potato, if you wish to make a larger quantity. <variation>When wanted richer, beat <ingredient rend="italic">two eggs,</ingredient> mix them with the hot milk, and put in the <implement>tureen</implement> before turning in the chowder. If added while the chowder is in the hot kettle, the eggs will curdle.</variation> Any firm white fish may be used for a chowder, but cod and haddock are best. Many use a cod's head with the haddock. The head is rich and gelatinous, and it should always be boiled with the bones, and the liquor added to the chowder. In this chowder you have nothing but what the most dainty person may relish. There are no bones, skin, or scraps of boiled pork. Fish, potatoes, and crackers are all distinct in the creamy liquid, instead of being a pasty mush, such as is often served. For a change, the crackers may be buttered and browned.</p><p><variation>If a highly seasoned dish be desired, boil an <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> cut into thin slices, with the <ingredient>potatoes;</ingredient> add more pepper, and either <ingredient>cayenne pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>Worcestershire sauce,</ingredient> or <ingredient>curry powder.</ingredient> Omit the boiling water, and use only that in which the bones were boiled, when making a smaller quantity.</variation></p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">FISH.</hd>
<p>FISH, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and wholesomeness, is invaluable as an article of food. It is less nutritious and less stimulating than meat, as it contains less solid matter and more water. An exaggerated idea of the value of fish as brain food has prevailed; the latest authorities, however, state that there is no evidence to prove that fish is any richer than meat in phosphorus. But as it contains little fat, the white varieties particularly, it is easily digested, and as it has a large proportion of nitrogenous material, it is especially adapted to all those upon whom there are great demands for nervous energy.</p><p>Salmon heads the list "of whatsoever hath scales and fins," in nutritive qualities; and it is richer than meat. The next in value are fat halibut, shad, white-fish, mackerel, blue-fish, lean halibut, bass, flounder, trout, cod, haddock, cusk, etc.</p><p>Red-blooded fish, like salmon, mackerel, and blue-fish, have the oil distributed through the body. They are nutritious for those who can digest them, but are too rich and oily for invalids. White fish, like flounder, halibut, cod, and haddock, have the oil in the liver, and are more easily digested. Fish should be perfectly fresh and <emph rend="italic">thoroughly</emph> cooked, or it will be very indigestible and sometimes poisonous. Broiling and baking are the best methods. Small pan-fish and fillets of large white dry fish are good if fried; but oily fish should never be fried. Salting draws out the nutritive part of fish the same as it does in meat; and either, when thus prepared, should be used as a relish, and not depended upon for nourishment. Fat fish are injured less than white fish, as the fat is not removed by salting.</p>

<p>All varieties of fish need an accompaniment of starchy foods, like bread and potatoes; and white fish need beside to be cooked with butter or fat to make them desirable as food. The juices of fish, shell-fish particularly, are of an alkaline nature; and this renders lemon juice or vinegar a desirable condiment as a neutralizing agency.</p><p>The flesh of good, fresh fish is <emph rend="italic">firm</emph> and <emph rend="italic">hard,</emph> and will rise at once when pressed with the finger. If the eyes be dull and sunken, the gills pale, and the flesh flabby or soft, the fish is not fresh.</p><p>Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible, in strongly salted water. They should be washed (not soaked) by wiping with a cloth wet in salt water. Then wrap them in a cloth which is sprinkled with salt, and put them in a cool place. If put in the <implement>ice-chest,</implement> they will taint the butter and milk. Put ice around them, if necessary; but do not let them touch the ice, as fresh water and ice will soften them. When once they lose their hard, firm consistency, they are considered unfit to eat by those who know what good fish really are.</p><p>Frozen fish should be thawed in cold water. Fresh-water fish having a muddy taste or smell are improved by soaking in salt and water. Salt fish should be soaked in fresh water, with the <emph rend="italic">skin side up,</emph> to draw out the salt, and should be eaten only occasionally, for the reason before stated.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Clean a Fish.</emph>--If the fish have scales, remove them before opening. Scrape with a small, sharp knife from the tail to the head; hold the knife flat and slanting, resting it on the fish, that the scales may be taken upon the knife; scrape slowly, that the scales may not fly over everything near, and rinse the knife often in cold water.</p><p>When the fish is to be served <emph rend="italic">whole,</emph> do not remove the <emph rend="italic">head</emph> and <emph rend="italic">tail.</emph> Smelts and small fish served whole are opened under the gills, and the contents squeezed out by pressing from the middle with the thumb and finger. Large fish are split open from the gills half-way down the lower

part of the body, the entrails removed, and the inside scraped and cleaned. Open far enough to remove all the blood on the backbone. Many leave the sound, which is the white part adhering to the bone; but it is better to remove it.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><ingredient rend="italic">To Skin a Fish.</ingredient>--Cut a thin, narrow strip down the backbone, taking off the dorsal fin. Then open the lower part half-way down. Slip the knife under and up through the bony part of the gills, and hold this bony part between the thumb and finger, and strip the skin off toward the tail. Then do the same on the other side.</p><p>Small fish, like mackerel and white-fish, when dressed for broiling, should be split through the back.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><ingredient rend="italic">To Bone a Fish.</ingredient>--Clean, and strip off the skin; lay the fish flat on a board; begin at the tail, and run the knife in under the flesh close to the bone, and scrape it away clean from the bone, holding the flesh carefully, not to break the flakes. When the flesh on one side is removed, slip the knife under the bone on the other side, and raise the bone, leaving the flesh on the board; then pull out all the small bones left in the flesh, which you can easily feel with the fingers. Fish with many fine bones, like shad and herring, are not boned; but from cod, cusk, mackerel, white-fish, and haddock they may be easily removed.</p></recipe>

<p><emph rend="italic">Fillets of Fish</emph> are the flesh separated from the bone, and served whole or divided, as the case may require. Flounders or sole, chicken halibut, and bass, should have the fillets on each side divided lengthwise; making four long thin pieces, or fillets. Other fish are cut into thin slices or small squares. Very small fish may be split, the bone removed, and the whole fish rolled up from the tail to the head and fastened with a skewer.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Fish.</purpose>

Boiling is the most insipid and wasteful way of cooking fish. To make boiled fish palatable, a rich sauce, like <ref target="lobstersauce">lobster,</ref> <ref target="oystersauce">oyster,</ref> or <ref target="shrimpsauce">shrimp sauce,</ref> is needed for all kinds except salmon and blue-fish. Salmon is so much richer and more oily than other fish that boiling does not injure it. <ref target="hollandaise">Hollandaise</ref> and <ref target="saucepiquante">sauce piquante</ref> are appropriate for salmon. A <implement>fish kettle</implement> with a <implement>drainer</implement> for lifting out the fish is quite essential. Or you may put a small piece of fish in a wire basket or on a plate; tie the plate in a square of cloth, and lift cloth, plate, and fish together. Never try to boil a fish whole, as nothing can be more

unsightly than the head of a boiled fish. Clean the fish thoroughly, and remove the head, tail, and skin. Rub well with <ingredient rend="italic">salt</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">lemon juice.</ingredient> Fish should be of uniform thickness, to boil nicely. A <ingredient rend="italic">small salmon</ingredient> or the <emph rend="italic">middle cut</emph> of a <emph rend="italic">large one,</emph> or the thickest part of <ingredient rend="italic">cod</ingredient> or <ingredient rend="italic">blue-fish,</ingredient> or a thick piece of <ingredient rend="italic">halibut,</ingredient> should be selected for boiling. Cod, haddock, and cusk, unless perfectly fresh, will break in boiling.</p><p>If fish be put into cold water, the juices are drawn out into the water. If cooked in rapidly boiling water, the fish breaks on the outside before the middle is done. The best and most economical way is to cook it in a <implement>steamer</implement> over boiling water. If that is not convenient, put the fish into boiling salted water, and simmer till done. Fish is cooked when the flesh separates easily from the bones, and should be taken up immediately, and well drained before serving. A very good way of boiling fish is to steep it for five minutes in strongly salted boiling water, with one or two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, then plunge it into fresh boiling water without salt, and simmer till done. Less scum rises in the fresh water, and the fish looks whiter. Allow about six minutes to a pound for boiling; more if in a cubical form than for a thin narrow piece of the same weight.</p><p>Serve boiled fish on a folded napkin, and the sauce in a sauce-boat. <ingredient>Parisienne potatoes</ingredient> boiled or fried and piled like cannon balls, alternating with <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> and <ingredient>button mushrooms;</ingredient> or sliced <ingredient>pickles,</ingredient> fried <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>Saratoga potatoes,</ingredient> slices of <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> or <ingredient>hard-boiled eggs</ingredient> may be used as a garnish.

Then the fish may be piled on the platter, higher and broader at one end and giving the outline of a flat fish; or arranged in the form of a fish shaped like the letter S, and covered with the crumbs. Or, if the fish be not broken in boiling, take it up carefully on the <implement>drainer,</implement> remove the head, skin, and small bones from one side, put a platter over the fish and invert platter and fish together; then remove the skin and the backbone from the other side, leaving the fish as whole as possible. Cover with the sauce and crumbs, and bake as above. This is not so desirable as the first method, because some fine bones are liable to be overlooked, and the sauce is not so well mixed with the fish.</p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">SHELL FISH.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Oysters, Clams, Scallops, Lobsters, Crabs, Shrimps,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Prawns</emph> are the principal varieties of shell fish used as food.</p>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Oysters.</hd>
<p>These shell fish are found in perfection in the cool waters of the Northern Atlantic coast. The Blue Points from Long Island are considered the best in the New York market. The Wareham and Providence River are equally esteemed in Boston. Oysters are neither healthful nor well flavored from May to September; at all other times they are used more extensively and are more highly prized than any other shell fish. They are nutritious, and are easily digested when fresh and eaten raw, or when only slightly cooked. When over-cooked, they are tough and leathery. Oysters should never be kept long after being taken from the shell; and if to be used raw, should not be opened till just before using.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">Oysters cooked in the Shells.</purpose>

--Wash and scrub the shells, and put them in a pan with the round side down (to hold the juice), and cook either in a hot oven, on the top of a hot stove, on a <implement>gridiron</implement> over the coals, or in a <implement>steamer,</implement> ten to twenty minutes. When the shells open, the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are done. Remove the upper shell; season the oyster on the lower shell with <ingredient rend="italic">butter,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">vinegar,</ingredient> and serve at once. Or take from the shells, put into a hot dish, season, and serve immediately. There is no other way of cooking the oyster in which the natural flavor is so fully developed.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">Raw Oysters.</purpose>

--Open the <ingredient>oysters;</ingredient> look them over carefully; remove any fine pieces of shell which may adhere to them; then season slightly with <ingredient rend="italic">salt</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">pepper,</ingredient> and let

them stand half an hour in the <implement>ice chest.</implement> Serve on fancy <implement>oyster plates,</implement> or on the deep half-shell, with <emph rend="italic">slices</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">lemon.</ingredient> Serve with small squares of buttered <ingredient rend="italic">brown bread.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">Oysters on Ice.</purpose>

--Put a rectangular block of <ingredient rend="italic">clear ice,</ingredient> having smooth, regular surfaces, in a large pan. With a hot brick or <implement>flat-iron</implement> melt a cavity large enough to hold the desired number of <ingredient>oysters.</ingredient> Pour the water from the cavity, and fill with oysters, which should first be drained, and seasoned with <ingredient rend="italic">salt</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">pepper.</ingredient> Place a thick napkin on a platter, put the ice upon this, cover the dish with <ingredient rend="italic">parsley</ingredient> or <ingredient rend="italic">smilax,</ingredient> and garnish with <ingredient rend="italic">lemon.</ingredient> The ice is sometimes roughly chipped to resemble a rock. If the dinner be served from the sideboard, individual plates of ice are made.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">To prepare Oysters for Cooking.</purpose>

--Pour half a cup of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> over one quart of <ingredient>oysters;</ingredient> then with clean hands take out the oysters separately and remove any bits of shell or seaweed. Serious accidents have often resulted from the presence of pieces of shell. The crabs which are found among the oysters are considered a delicacy and should be saved. The oyster liquor is seldom used, as enough comes from the oysters in cooking; but, if desired, it should be strained before using. The oysters may then be cooked in any of the following ways.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">To cook or parboil Oysters in their Liquor.</purpose>

--Put them in a saucepan without water; stir them, or shake the pan slightly; as soon as heated, sufficient <ingredient>liquor</ingredient> comes from them to keep them from burning. When the edges curl or ruffle, and the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> look plump instead of flat, they are cooked.

<hd align="center" rend="bold">A Clam Bake.</hd>
<p>An impromptu clam bake may be had at any time at low tide along the coast where clams are found. If you wish to have genuine fun, and to know what an appetite one can have for the bivalves, make up a pleasant party and dig for the clams yourselves. A short thick dress, shade hat, rubber boots,--or, better still, no boots at all, if you can bring your mind to the comfort of bare feet,--a small garden trowel, a fork, and a basket, and you are ready. Let those who are not digging gather a large pile of driftwood and seaweed, always to be found along the shore. Select a dozen or more large stones, and of them make a level floor; pile the driftwood upon them, and make a good brisk fire to heat the stones thoroughly. When hot enough to crackle as you sprinkle water upon them, brush off the embers, letting them fall between the stones. Put a thin layer of seaweed on the hot stones, to keep the lower clams from burning. Rinse the clams in salt water by plunging the basket which contains them in the briny pools near by. Pile them over the hot stones, heaping them high in the centre. Cover with a thick layer of seaweed, and a piece of old canvas, blanket, carpet, or dry leaves, to keep in the steam. The time for baking will depend upon the size and quantity of the clams. Peep in occasionally at those around the edge. When the shells are open, the clams are done. They are delicious eaten from the shell, with no other sauce than their own briny sweetness. Melted butter, pepper, and vinegar should be
 
<pb n="181" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=201"/>

ready for those who wish them; then all may "fall to." Fingers must be used. A Rhode Islander would laugh at any one trying to use a knife and fork. Pull off the thin skin, take them by the black end, dip them in the prepared butter, and bite off close to the end. If you swallow them whole, they will not hurt you. At a genuine Rhode Island clam bake, blue-fish, lobsters, crabs, sweet potatoes, and ears of sweet corn in their gauzy husks are baked with the clams. The clam steam gives them a delicious flavor. Brown bread is served with the clams, and watermelon for dessert completes the feast.</p></subsection>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Lobsters.</hd>
<p>The markets are now so well supplied with these delicious shell fish, that they may be obtained in good condition all the year. The canned lobster is also convenient in an emergency, for use in soups and salads. Lobsters are put alive into boiling salted water, and cooked twenty minutes from the time the water boils. They should not be eaten until cold, and never be kept more than eighteen hours after boiling. Lobsters are difficult of digestion, and should be eaten with mustard, cayenne pepper, and lemon juice or vinegar.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Choose a Lobster.</emph>--Select one of medium size, heavy in proportion to the size.

thin shells are watery. If the tail spring back quickly when straightened, the lobster is fresh.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Open a Lobster.</emph>--Wipe the shell with a wet cloth. Break off the large claws, separate the tail from the body and the body from the shell, leaving the stomach, or lady, in the shell; then remove the small claws. Save the green liver and coral. Crush the tail by pressing the sides together, then pull it open on the under side, and take out the meat in one piece. Draw back the flesh on the upper end of this meat, and remove the intestinal canal, which runs the entire length. This is sometimes black, and sometimes the color of the meat. Break off all the gills on the body before picking the meat from the joints, as they are liable to drop off with the meat, and are too woolly to be palatable. The gills, stomach, and intestines are the only parts not eaten. Break the body in the middle, and pick the meat from the joints, being careful not to take any of the bones. When the shells of the large claws are thin, cut off a strip down the sharp edge, and remove the meat whole; or break them by hammering on the edge. Never pound them in the middle, as that crushes the meat. If the lobster shell is to be used for serving the meat, cut down the under side of the tail with a sharp knife, and remove the meat without breaking the outside shell. Trim the inside, and clean the shell. The body shell may be cleaned, split in halves, and trimmed with sharp scissors into the shape of clam shells.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">MEAT AND FISH SAUCES.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Drawn Butter,</emph> or water and melted butter thickened with flour, and seasoned, is the simplest form of a sauce.</p><p>When milk, or cream, or white stock is used in place of water, less butter is required, and the sauce is called <emph rend="italic">White,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Cream,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">B&#233;chamel sauce.</emph></p><p>By browning the butter, using brown stock, and adding different seasoning materials, we have all the varieties of <emph rend="italic">Brown sauces.</emph></p><p>Many people fail in making sauces by not cooking the flour sufficiently, and also by serving them with a mass of oily butter on the surface. Usually the flour is wet to a smooth paste and stirred into the boiling liquid. When made in this manner, the sauce should boil at least ten minutes to have the flour thoroughly cooked. But by cooking the dry flour in the hot butter the starch in the flour is more quickly cooked, and the butter is all absorbed and converted into an emulsion. Sauces made in this manner are perfectly smooth, free from grease, and have a fine flavor. Every one should learn how to make both white and brown sauces. They are adapted to nearly every form of food. Meats, fish, vegetables, eggs, macaroni, rice, toast, etc., are rendered more palatable by being served with an appropriate sauce.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">EGGS.</hd>
<p>Whatever else you may economize in, do <emph rend="italic">not</emph> limit your family in respect to eggs. They are nutritious, and even at four cents each are cheaper than meat. They should be used freely by all except those who <emph rend="italic">know</emph> they cannot digest them. <emph rend="italic">Using freely</emph> does not mean their unnecessary or extravagant use in rich cakes, custards, etc., nor in the indigestible form of fried or what is ordinarily called hard-boiled eggs; but it means the frequent use of them in any of the simple forms of boiling, baking, omelets, plain cake, and other wholesome combinations. It is very poor economy, especially for those who keep hens, to exchange eggs for corned beef or salt fish; or to use soda and cream of tartar as a substitute for eggs in sponge cake, or half-cooked flour in an omelet. They may be served in an unlimited variety of styles, are especially suitable for breakfast or lunch, attractive as a garnish, and when combined with sugar and milk make the most healthful puddings, desserts, or tea dishes.</p><p>But though a type of perfect food, eggs are not intended to be eaten exclusively, any more than other foods. They are one of the most highly concentrated forms of food, and, being wholly destitute of starch, should be eaten with bread or rice.</p><p>The white of the egg has but a trace of fat in it, and requires the addition of butter, milk, or fat meat, like bacon or ham. The white of egg contains water, mineral ingredients, and soluble albumen; the yolk has, in addition to these, oil and sulphur. The albumen is enclosed in layers of thin-walled cells. When beaten, these walls break, and the albumen, owing to its glutinous nature, catches and holds the air, and increases to many times its original bulk.</p>
 
<pb n="198" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=218"/>

<p>Do not use an egg till it has been laid ten hours, as the white does not become set or thick till then, and cannot be beaten stiff. Eggs for poaching or boiling are best when thirty-six hours old. Albumen, when heated, becomes a dense solid; if mixed and heated with a liquid, it hardens and entangles in its meshes any solids or impurities in the liquid, and rises to the surface with them as scum, or precipitates them. It is thus the white of egg clears soups, jellies, and coffee. Strong acids, corrosive sublimate, and creosote will also coagulate albumen; and therefore, if any of these poisons be taken into the system, the white of egg, swallowed quickly, will combine with the poison and protect the stomach.</p><p>The shells of newly laid eggs are almost full; but as the shells are porous, on exposure to the air, the water inside evaporates, and the eggs grow lighter, while air rushes in to fill the place of the water, and causes the nitrogenous elements to decompose, and the eggs soon spoil. This explains why a good egg is heavy, and will sink in water; and why a stale egg is lighter, has a rattling or gurgling sound, and floats in the water. Anything which will fill up the pores and thus exclude the air, when applied to perfectly fresh eggs, will preserve them indefinitely; a coating of liquid fat or gum, or a packing in bran or salt, with the small end downward, is effectual. Eggs should be kept in a cool, dark place, and handled carefully, as any rough motion may cause the white and yolk to become mixed, by rupturing the membrane which separates them, and then the egg spoils quickly.</p><p>Never buy eggs about the freshness of which you have any doubt, not even in winter. One can easily judge which is better economy,--to pay twenty-five or thirty cents a dozen, and find none of them full and fresh, and perhaps half of them really rotten; or to pay fifty cents, and obtain them freshly laid,--not merely fresh from the country,--and all sound and good. Eggs with a dark shell are richer and have larger yolks. Eggs are of better

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Eggs (the Best Way).</purpose>

Put the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and let them stand about ten minutes where the water will keep hot (180&#176;), but not boiling. The white should be of a soft jelly-like consistency, and the yolk soft but not liquid. Experience will show the exact time to keep the eggs in the water to suit individual tastes. They should be served immediately, as they harden by being kept in the hot shell. An egg, to be cooked soft, should never be cooked in <ingredient rend="italic">boiling water,</ingredient> as the white hardens unevenly before the heat reaches the yolk.</p></recipe>

If the shell of an egg be cracked before boiling, pierce several small holes in the large end to keep the contents from bursting out at the crack.</p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">MEAT.</hd>
<p>MEAT is a general term applied to the flesh of animals used for food. It includes the muscular flesh, sinews, fat, heart, liver, stomach, brains, and tongue. Meat is divided into three classes:--</p><p><emph rend="italic">Meat,</emph> including beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Poultry,</emph> including chicken, turkey, geese, and ducks, or all domestic fowls.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Game,</emph> including partridges, grouse, pigeons, quail, or other birds, venison, and any wild meat that is hunted in the forest or field.</p><p>Meat consists of several substances,--<emph rend="italic">fibrine, albumen, gelatine, fat,</emph> and the <emph rend="italic">juice of flesh.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Fibrine</emph> exists in the blood and flesh. In the former it is soluble, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood; it is deposited by the blood, made into flesh, and becomes insoluble flesh-fibrine, and forms the basis or fibre of muscular tissue. It is separated into bundles by membranes, and into larger separate masses by cellular tissue, in which fat is deposited. Its true color is white; but the blood in the veins which penetrate every part of the fibre gives it a reddish tinge. This may be seen by washing a piece of lean meat in cold water. The red coloring matter is soon drawn into the water, and the meat is a mass of white fibre. Fibrine is hardened and contracted by intense heat, but softened by moderate and long continued heat. Meat that has tough fibre should simmer and not boil.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Albumen</emph> exists in the flesh and in the blood. It is the soluble portion of the flesh. It dissolves in cold water, but hardens in hot water.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Gelatine</emph> is a peculiar substance found in the tendons
 
<pb n="211" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=231"/>

and gristly parts of flesh, the shin, and the sinewy parts about the joints, and in the nutritive parts of bones. It may be dissolved by soaking in cold water, and then boiling gently for several hours. The solution hardens when cold. Gelatine hardens in a dry heat, and such parts of meat as contain it in abundance should be stewed, rather than roasted or broiled.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Fat of meat</emph> is contained, a good measure of it, in the adipose tissue of almost all flesh which is used as food. It is liquefied by heat, and resolved into various acid and acrid bodies. It is a warmth-giver, and is therefore most appropriately used in cold seasons and climates.</p><p><emph rend="italic">The juice of the flesh</emph> consists of water, a small proportion of albumen, and a mixture of other compounds. It is not the blood, for it still exists after the blood has been withdrawn. It may be obtained by chopping lean meat fine, putting it in a closely covered jar without water, and heating it gradually. If heated above 160&#176;, the albuminous matters in it harden and turn brown. The solid residue, consisting of fibres, tissue, etc., is white, tasteless, and inodorous. This separated juice is strongly acid, while the blood is always alkaline. It contains many substances which are very valuable as food, and the savory principle, or <emph rend="italic">ozmazome,</emph> which gives flavor to the meat and causes it to differ in different animals. Meat should always be cooked in such a manner as to retain the largest proportion of this juice. The juice is drawn out into the brine in salting, and this renders salt meat less nutritious. The juice when the water has been separated from it by evaporation, is termed <emph rend="italic">extract of meat.</emph></p><p>The flesh of all young animals is more tender, but not so nutritious as that of maturer animals. Nearly all parts of an animal may be used as food.</p><p>Meat is in season all the year; but certain kinds are better at stated times. <emph rend="italic">Pork</emph> is good only in autumn and winter; <emph rend="italic">veal,</emph> in the spring and summer;<emph rend="italic">venison</emph> in the winter;<emph rend="italic">fowls,</emph> in autumn and winter;<emph rend="italic">lamb,</emph> in the summer and fall;<emph rend="italic">mutton</emph> and <emph rend="italic">beef</emph> at any time.</p>

<p>All meat should be removed from the brown paper in which it is wrapped as soon as it comes from the market, or it will taste of the paper and the paper will absorb the meat juices. Wipe all over with a clean wet cloth. Chops and steaks will keep sweet much longer if examined at once, and any parts that are not clean and sweet removed. In warm weather look at the meat often. Put it on a dish near, but never directly upon, the ice.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">BEEF.</hd>
<p>GOOD beef should be bright red, well marbled with yellowish-white fat, and with a thick outside layer of fat. The flesh must be firm, and when pressed with the finger no mark should be left. The suet should be dry, and crumble easily.</p><p>A side of beef is divided into hind quarter and fore quarter. The <emph rend="italic">hind quarter</emph> consists of the round, the rump, and the loin. The <emph rend="italic">fore quarter</emph> is divided into the back half and the rattle rand. In cutting up a hind quarter, the flank is first removed. The cut should slant two or three inches toward the tip. The upper part of the flank has the ends of the short ribs, and is used for corning. The lower end of the flank has no bones. This may be stuffed, rolled, and boiled, either fresh or corned. The <emph rend="italic">round</emph> is separated from the rump in the line from <ref target="linc232.jpg">7 to 9.</ref> The aitch bone <ref target="linc232.jpg">(7)</ref> lies between the back and middle cut of the rump and the top of the round. It is usually sold whole; it makes a good roast for a small family, considering the price (10 cents), and is the best piece for a beef stew.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 17. Aitch Bone.</caption><description>A detailed illustration of an aitch bone of beef.</description></illustration>
<p>The first cuts of the vein <ref target="linc232.jpg">(9)</ref> which joins the face of the rump make good steak. The top of the round is
 
<pb n="215" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=235"/>

the inside of the thickest part of the leg <ref target="linc232.jpg">(8 1/2, behind 8 in the diagram)</ref>. As seen on the counter, it is above the bone. It consists of one large section or muscle with a thick edge of fat. The best round steaks lie between this point and the ridge of fat. The third slice is considered the best. After cutting beyond this ridge comes the beginning of another muscle, which is very tough. One may easily detect, by the separation of this narrow strip of meat along the top of the slice, whether the meat came from the best part of the top of the round. It may be the best the marketman has; but it is not the best cut, though often palmed off in place of the third slice. The under part of the round has two sections or muscles, the one nearest the bone being larger than the outside section. The skin is thin, with very little fat. Steaks from this cut are sometimes sold as good round steak to the ignorant buyer; but keep in mind that in the top cut there is one large muscle with thick fat, instead of two smaller muscles and thin fat, and you will not be deceived. This under cut of the round is excellent for braising. It is well shaped, requires no trimming, and is the cheapest cut, as every scrap of it may be eaten. Below this, as we follow down the leg, are nice pieces for stews, pie meat, etc.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 18. Round, showing the beginning of the tough muscle on the top.</caption><description>A detailed illustration of a round of beef.</description></illustration>
<p>The marrow bone, running through the round to the shin, contains the best marrow. The next best is in the

foreshin. The hind shin differs from the fore shin in having a thick tendon, which separates entirely from the end of the leg, and unites again at the joint, forming a loop by which the hind quarter is hung on the meat hook. The middle cut of the shin may be used for stews and braising, and the lower part for soups.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 19. Back of Rump.</caption><description>A detailed illustration of the back of a rump of beef.</description></illustration>
<p>The rump is usually separated from the loin, and divided into the back, middle, and face of the rump. The back of the rump, one of the best pieces for roasting, has part of the backbone and sometimes the rump bone, as some marketmen will not cut it out before weighing. The small end nearest the loin has the most tender meat. The middle cut has no bone, but it is not tender. It is better for braising than for roasting. Sometimes the rump is not divided, and is cut into steaks. If cut parallel with the backbone, it will be tough. If cut at right angles, and from the end nearest the loin, it makes the

best steaks, and is well worth the extra price charged for cutting in this manner. The face of the rump has a thick piece of fat in the middle, often purposely covered by a thin cutting from the tenderloin. This is a cheap piece for roasting, but not of the best quality.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 21. Sirloin Roast, second Cut.</caption><description>A detailed illustration of the second cut of sirloing of beef.</description></illustration>
<p>The sirloin is separated from the rump in a slanting direction. Never buy the first slice, as it always has a small narrow bone near the top in addition to the rib, and a larger portion of tough flank and gristle than the middle or second cuts. As it lies on the counter you may easily tell if it be the first slice by the small bone; and if you press on the top of the meat near the middle, a small section of meat bulges out. This is the end of the muscle forming the face of the rump and vein, and is very tough. The second cut of sirloin has the most tenderloin, and only a straight rib at right angles with the backbone. Any part after the first slice is taken off, until you come to the tip, is called the second cut, and is sold for roasts or steak. The tip is very juicy. The whole hind-quarter is hung up by the shin, the juices all flow down, and the tip holds a large portion. The muscles which are the least used have the most tender fibre and the least juice. These muscles, lying along the loin or middle of the backbone, above the ribs, and forming the top of the sirloin, are more tender, but less juicy, than those of the rump and round. The tenderloin, lying along the middle of the back under the sirloin, from below the tip to the face of the rump, is protected by its bed of suet below, and its roof of bones above. It is a muscle very little used, is very tender, but dry, and entirely without flavor. This is removed

whole, and sold as the long fillet; or divided, and the smaller part, lying under the rump, sold as the short fillet.</p><p>In cold weather it is economy to buy a large sirloin. Remove the fillet, or tenderloin, and cook that first, as it spoils easily; corn the flank, or use it for a stew; and roast the upper part. If very large, roast it slightly the first time, and it may be roasted again for a second dinner.</p>

<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Fore Quarter.</hd>
<p>The back half of the fore quarter has the backbone on the upper edge. The best roasting piece is the first cut of the rib, which joins the tip of the sirloin, and is sometimes sold for the tip. The tip has only one thick muscle above the rib, and the bones are usually slanting. One side of the first cut of the rib looks just like the tip; the other side has the beginning of another tough muscle next to the skin, and the bones are straight. There are ten ribs in the fore quarter; three are left in the sirloin. This first cut may be one, two, three, or four ribs; but two are enough to roast for a small family. The shoulder blade begins in the fifth rib, and above this lie what are called the chuck ribs. The meat above the blade is tough, and 
 
<pb n="219" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=239"/>

only suitable for stews. The part underneath is cut into small steaks, and is often offered for sale as sirloin steaks. The shoulder of mutton, just above the fore shin, is good for braising and pie meat.</p>
<illustration><caption>FIG. 23. First Cut of Rib.</caption><description>A detailed illustration of the first cut of rib of beef.</description></illustration>
<p>The rattle rand is divided into three long narrow strips, thick and lean at the upper end, and thin and fat at the lower end, all of which are usually corned. The upper part, called the rattle, is divided into three cuts. The thick upper end is preferred by those who like lean corned beef. The second cut has straight ribs running through it, and three distinct layers of meat with fat, and is considered the choicest piece by those who like "a streak of fat and a streak of lean." The middle strip has a thick layer of fat, and only one layer of lean, and the bones are slanting. This is not a desirable piece. The lower strip is the brisket, the upper end of which is thick; the lower end,

toward the middle of the creature, is called the navel end. Brisket pieces always have what is called a selvedge on the lower side, and the breast bones running at right angles with the rib. After a little experience in marketing one may easily distinguish the various cuts of beef. It is well to know what you want, and to know whether you get what you have ordered.</p></section>

If there be a large piece of the flank, cut it off, and use it for soups or stews. If you prefer to use it for this purpose after roasting, draw it round underneath and fasten it with a skewer. Lay the meat on a rack in a pan, and dredge all over with <ingredient rend="italic">salt,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">pepper,</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">flour.</ingredient> Put it in a very hot over with <emph rend="italic">two</emph> or <emph rend="italic">three tablespoonfuls</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">drippings</ingredient> or pieces of the beef fat placed in the pan. Place a rack under the pan, or turn the heat off from the bottom of the oven. Put the skin side down at first, that the heat may harden the juices in the lean part. When the flour is brown on the pan and the meat is seared, baste with the fat and reduce the heat. Baste often, and dredge twice with salt and flour. When seared all over, turn and bring the skin side up for the final basting and browning. Bake fifty or sixty minutes, if liked very rare; an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half, if liked well done. If there be any danger of burning the fat in the pan, add a little hot water after the flour is browned. Meat may be roasted and carved better if placed in the pan and on the platter with the skin up instead of the flesh side.</p><p>Carve a sirloin roast by cutting several thin slices parallel with the ribs. Then cut down near the backbone and separate the slices. Cut out the tenderloin from under the bone, and slice it in the same manner. Many turn the sirloin over and remove the tenderloin first. Serve a little of the crisp fat on the flank to those who wish it.</p></recipe>

--Remove the backbone and ribs. Skewer or tie into a round shape, and prepare as for sirloin.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic"><alt synonym1="beef rump roast">The Back of the Rump.</alt></purpose>

--This is the best and cheapest piece for roasting, as the meat is all good and there is not as much bone as in other pieces. It is usually too large for a small family; but in cold weather it may be used to advantage, by cutting steaks from the thickest end, using the small end for a roast and the bones for soup.</p><p>In carving the <ingredient>rump,</ingredient> when the bone has not been taken out, a deep cut should be made at the base, to loosen the meat; then the slices may be cut lengthwise or crosswise. When the family is large and all the meat is to be used, it is well to cut it lengthwise. Should only a small quantity be needed, cut only from the small end, and save the tougher parts for a stew. Many think it more economical to serve the poorer parts the first day, as they are then more palatable, reserving the tender meat to be served cold.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose rend="italic">Gravy for Roast Beef.</purpose>

--When the meat is done, put it on a plate, and keep it hot while making the gravy. Hold the corner of the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> over a bowl; let the liquid in the pan settle; then pour off all the fat and save it.
 
<pb n="222" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=242"/>

When no water is used in baking and the oven is very hot, this liquid will be the fat from the meat. The brown flour will settle, and some will adhere to the pan. Pour <emph rend="italic">one pint</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">hot water</ingredient> or <ingredient rend="italic">stock</ingredient> into the pan, and scrape off all the sediment. Pour this water into a saucepan from which it may be poured easily, and place it on the stove to heat. Put <emph rend="italic">four tablespoonfuls</emph> of the <ingredient rend="italic">hot fat</ingredient> into a small frying-pan, and when browned stir in <emph rend="italic">two heaping tablespoonfuls</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">dry flour,</ingredient> or enough to absorb all the fat. Stir until the flour is brown and well mixed; then add the hot liquid gradually, and stir as it thickens. Season with <ingredient rend="italic">salt</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">pepper,</ingredient> and simmer five minutes. Strain if not perfectly smooth. Gravy can be made in the <implement>dripping-pan;</implement> but such pans are usually large, inconvenient to handle, and take up more space than can be spared on the top of the stove, and are much harder to wash when the gravy has been made in them. To make it in the pan, pour off nearly all the fat. Put the pan on the stove and add <emph rend="italic">dry flour</emph> until the fat is all absorbed. Then add <ingredient rend="italic">hot water</ingredient> or <ingredient rend="italic">hot stock,</ingredient> and stir as it thickens. Cook five to eight minutes, and strain. It is well for those who like gravies to make a large quantity, as it is useful in warming over the remnants of the roast. But there is no sauce or made gravy equal to the natural juices contained in the meat, which should flow freely into the platter when the meat is carved.</p></recipe>

<p>Beef and sheep's kidneys are often recommended for food on account of their cheapness. Epicures are fond of them. The taste for them is an acquired taste, which it is not desirable to cultivate. The latest decision of physicians is that they are not suitable to eat; as "from their constant use in the animal system as excretory organs,--organs which separate from the blood that which, if it remained in the blood, would poison the system,--they are often liable to become diseased."</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">MUTTON AND LAMB.</hd>
<p>MUTTON stands next to beef in nutritive qualities, and with many has even more value as food, because more easily digested. In mutton about one half the weight is in fat, while with beef it is only one third.</p><p>The choicest mutton comes from the mountainous regions of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. Good mutton should be large and heavy, the fat clear white and very hard, the flesh fine-grained and bright red. Poor mutton has but little fat, and little flesh as compared with the bone.</p><p>Mutton is cut at the market by splitting down the back, and dividing at the loin into the hind and fore quarters; or the hind and fore quarters are separated without splitting, and the loin is taken out whole and sold as the saddle of mutton. The leg, loin, and saddle are best for roasting, and are better if kept for some time before cooking. The leg, if to be boiled, should be fresh. The fore quarter is good boned and stuffed; then steamed, and browned in the oven. The neck and bones are used for broths and stews. Chops are cut from the ribs and from the loin. The rib chops are sometimes cut long, with the flank on. The bone is removed and the meat rolled. These roll chops are not economical, as the flank forms the greater part. French chops are cut short from the rib, and the flesh is scraped clean from the end of the bone. The best-flavored, most tender, and cheapest in the end, are the chops from the loin. They have very little bone, and a piece of tenderloin.</p><p>Mutton has a strong flavor, disagreeable to many. It is said to be caused by the oil from the wool, which penetrates the skin. The pink skin above the fat should always be removed from chops, and wherever it is possible,
 
<pb n="233" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=253"/>

scrape it off without cutting into the lean. The caul, or lining membrane of the abdomen, is fastened round the meat, particularly on the leg, partly to increase its weight. This is often left on in roasting to help baste the meat; but it gives a strong flavor, and should always be removed, and the kidney fat used if needed. If care be taken in selecting only the best mutton, and in cooking it in the best manner, many who have become prejudiced against it could eat it with as much relish as beef. Mutton may be cooked rare, but lamb should always be well cooked. The end of the bone in a leg of mutton is smooth and oval, and is separated at the joint; while lamb may be known from mutton by the flat, irregularly grooved end of the bone, which is broken off squarely, instead of separated at the joint. Sometimes the bone is cut off close to the second joint, and then you will have to depend upon the word of your butcher.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p><purpose rend="italic">Mutton Duck.</purpose>

--Select a <ingredient>fore quarter of mutton</ingredient> with the whole length of the leg bone left on. Ask the butcher to cut off what is called a raised shoulder, that is, raised from the backbone and ribs, cutting it far up on the shoulder to take in the whole of the shoulder blade, bone, and gristle. You may cut it yourself by removing the neck, the back bones, the ribs, and breast bones, leaving the shoulder blade in the upper part. Then scrape the flesh from the shoulder blade, and separate the blade at the joint. Lay it aside for further use. Remove the meat from the leg bone, turning the meat over, as you would turn a glove over your hand. Be careful not to cut through the thin skin at the end of the leg. When within three inches of the lower joint, saw the bone off, and saw or trim the bone below the joint into the shape of a duck's bill. Bend the joint without breaking the skin. Wipe the

meat and rub inside with <ingredient rend="italic">salt.</ingredient> Make a <ingredient rend="italic">moist stuffing</ingredient> and put it in between the layers of meat. With a coarse needle threaded with twine gather the edges of the meat, draw them together, fill the cavity with stuffing, and shape the meat into a long oval form like the body of a duck. Bend the leg at the lower joint to represent the duck's head and neck, and keep it in place with skewers. Run one skewer through the side at the top of the body, and put one into the body on each side of the neck. Wind a string around the bill, and fasten it to the skewers. Scrape the shoulder blade clean, trim the bony end into a sharp point, and notch the gristle at the opposite end. Insert this in the body to represent the tail, and fasten with twine. Put the bones and scraps of meat in water in a <implement>steamer</implement> or kettle. Place the duck on a plate, and steam it over the bones one hour to make it tender. Dredge with <ingredient rend="italic">salt,</ingredient> <ingredient rend="italic">pepper,</ingredient> and <ingredient rend="italic">flour,</ingredient> and bake one hour, or till brown; use the water in the kettle for basting if needed, or for a gravy.

<hd align="center" size="larger">VEAL.</hd>
<p>VEAL is always in the market, but is better in the spring. The fat should be white and clear; and the lean, pink or flesh color. If the flesh be white, the calf has been bled before being killed, and the meat is unfit to eat. Veal contains less nitrogen, but more gelatine, than beef. It has very little flavor, and needs to be highly seasoned to make it even palatable. Veal stands lowest among heat-producing meats, and should be eaten with potatoes or rice, which stand highest, or with bacon and jelly, which furnish in their fat and sugar the carbon wanting in the flesh. It should always be thoroughly cooked, as underdone veal is not wholesome. At its lowest price veal is never a cheap food when we take into consideration the small amount of nutriment it contains, the large amount of fuel required to cook it, and the danger of being made ill by its use.</p><p>The lower part of the leg or knuckle and all the gristly portions are used for soups. Cutlets, or steaks, the fillet, fricandeau, or cushion, are cut from the thickest part of the leg. The loin is used for chops or roasts, the breast for roasts, and the neck for stews and soups. Calf's head and pluck includes the lights, heart, and liver. The head is used for soup, the heart and liver for braising. The lights are now seldom used.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">PORK.</hd>
<p>PORK is an unwholesome meat, and should never be eaten by children, or people with weak digestion, nor, indeed, by any one except in cold weather. Salt pork, bacon, and ham are less objectionable than fresh pork. If fresh pork be desired, obtain it, if possible, from a source where you can be sure the animal has been kept in a cleanly manner and fattened on corn. Fresh pork should be young and firm, the fat white, the lean a pale red, and the skin white and clear. The fat, when salted, should be a delicate pink, and the rind should be thin. Soft, flabby flesh, and yellowish fat with kernels, indicate that the pork is not of the best quality. Unlike other meat, pork is divided into fat and lean. The flank and the thick layer of fat above the flesh are salted. The sides of very young pigs are smoked, as well as salted, and are called bacon. The hams and shoulders are salted and smoked. The head and feet are pickled or boiled, and made into souse or head cheese. After the fat is removed, the loin and ribs are used for roasting or for chops. The leaf fat from the kidneys is heated until melted, then strained, cooled, and used as lard. The trimmings of lean and fat, when chopped and highly seasoned, are called sausage meat.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">POULTRY AND GAME.</hd>
<p>THE flesh of poultry and of game birds has less red blood than the flesh of animals; but as it abounds in phosphates, it is valuable food, particularly for invalids. The flesh is drier, and not marbled with fat as in that of quadrupeds. All game has a strong odor and flavor, which is by some mistaken for that of tainted meat. It should be kept till tender, but no longer, unless frozen.</p><p>White-fleshed game should be cooked till well done; that with dark flesh may be served underdone. The breast of all birds is the most juicy and nutritious part. "The wing of a walker and the leg of a flier are considered choice tidbits."</p>
<section class1="marketing"><p><emph rend="italic">To Choose Poultry and Game.</emph>--The best <emph rend="italic">chickens</emph> have soft yellow feet, short thick legs, smooth moist skin, plump breast; and the cartilage on the end of the breast bone is soft and pliable.

Pin feathers always indicate a young bird; and long hairs, an older one. The bodies of <emph rend="italic">capons</emph> are very plump and fat, and larger in proportion than those of fowls or chickens. The meat is of finer flavor.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Old fowls</emph> have long thin necks and feet, and sharp scales; the flesh has a purplish tinge, and they usually have a large amount of fat.</p><p>The best <emph rend="italic">turkeys</emph> have smooth black legs, with soft, loose spurs, full breasts, and white plump flesh.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Geese</emph> and <emph rend="italic">ducks</emph> should be young, not more than a year old, have white soft fat, yellow feet, and tender wings, and be thick and hard on the breast.

<section class1="meatfishgame"><p><emph rend="italic">To Clean and Truss Poultry and Game.</emph>--The practice of sending poultry to market undressed is one that demands as earnest opposition from housekeepers as that of the adulteration of food. The meat is rendered unfit to eat, is sometimes infected with poison; and the increase in weight makes poultry a very expensive food. All poultry should be dressed as soon as killed. The feathers come out more easily when the fowl is warm, and when stripped off toward the head. If the skin be very tender, pull the feathers out the opposite way. Use a knife to remove the pin feathers. Singe the hairs and down by holding the fowl over a gas jet, or over a roll of lighted paper held over the fire. Cut off the head, and if the fowl is to be roasted, slip the skin back from the neck and cut the neck off close to the body, leaving skin enough to fold over on the back. Remove the windpipe; pull the crop away from the skin on the neck and breast, and cut off close to the opening into the body. Be careful not to tear the skin. Always pull the crop out from the end of the neck, rather than through a cut in the skin, which if made has to be sewed together. Cut through the skin about two inches below the leg joint; bend the leg at the cut by pressing it on the edge of the table, and break off the bone. Then pull, not cut, out the tendons. If care be taken to cut only through the skin, these cords may be pulled out easily,
 
<pb n="253" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=273"/>

one at a time, with the fingers. Or take them all out at once, by putting the foot of the fowl against the casing of a door, then shut the door tightly and pull on the leg. The tendons will come out with the foot; but if once cut they cannot be removed. The drumstick of a roast chicken or turkey is greatly improved by removing the tendons, which always become hard and bony in baking. There is a special advantage in cutting the leg below the joint, as the ends of the bones afford more length for tying, and after roasting this is easily broken off, leaving a clean, unburned joint for the table. Cut out the oil bag in the tail. It is better to dress a fowl for a fricassee first. Then you learn the position of the internal organs, and can tell better how to remove them when dressing for roasting, as with the whole fowl you work by feeling and not by sight.</p></section>
<section class1="meatfishgame"><p><emph rend="italic">To Cut up a Fowl for a Fricassee.</emph>--Cut through the loose skin between the legs and body, bend the leg over, and cut off at the joint; then cut off the wings. Make an incision in the skin near the vent, and cut the membrane lying between the breastbone and the tail, down to the backbone, on each side. Then you have the intestines, gizzard, liver, and heart exposed, and can easily remove them. Do not forget the kidneys, lying in the hollow of the backbone, and the lungs in the ribs. Cut the ribs through the cartilage, separate the collar bone, and break the backbone just below the ribs. Divide at the joints in the wings and legs; separate the side bones from the back, and remove the bone from the breast. Never chop the bones, but divide smoothly at the joints.</p></section>
<section class1="meatfishgame"><p><emph rend="italic">To Dress a Fowl for Roasting.</emph>--Make an incision near the vent; insert two fingers, loosen the fat from the skin, and separate the membranes lying close to the body. Keep the fingers up close to the breastbone, until you can reach in beyond the liver and heart, and loosen on either side down toward the back. The gall bladder lies under the lobe of the liver on the left side, and if the fingers be kept up, and everything loosened before drawing out, there will be no danger of its breaking. The kidneys and
 
<pb n="254" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=274"/>

lungs are often left in by careless cooks; but everything that can be taken out must be removed. When the fowl has been cleaned carefully, it will not require much washing. Hold it under the faucet, or rinse out the inside quickly; then wipe dry.</p><p>If the breastbone protrude more than is desirable, put a small knife in at the opening, and cut through the cartilage in the ribs or through the breastbone.

<section class1="meatfishgame"><p><emph rend="italic">To Stuff a Fowl.</emph>--Place the fowl in a bowl, and put the stuffing in at the neck; fill out the breast until plump and even. Then draw the neck skin together at the end, and sew it over on the back. Put the remainder of the stuffing into the body at the other opening, and if full, sew it with coarse thread or fine twine.

Wind a string from the tail to the skewer in the thigh, then up to the one in the wing, across the back to the other wing, then down to the opposite thigh, and tie firmly round the tail. If you have no skewers, the strings must be passed round the body, over the thighs and wings; and care must be taken, in removing them, not to tear the browned crust on the breast. Sometimes the feet are cut off in the joint, and the legs passed into the body and out through an opening under the sidebone near the tail, or left in the body and covered with the skin.</p></section>

Carve the breast in thin slices parallel with the breastbone. Some prefer to cut it at right angles with the bone. Take off the wish-bone; separate the collar-bone from the breast; slip the knife under the shoulder blade, and turn it over. Cut through the cartilage which divides the ribs, separating the breast from the back. Then turn the back over, place the knife midway, and with the fork lift up the tail end, separating the back from the body. Place the fork in the middle of the backbone, and cut close to the backbone, from one end to the other, freeing the side bone. As soon as the legs and wings are disjointed, begin to serve, offering white or dark meat and stuffing as each prefers. Do not remove the fork from the breastbone till the breast is separated from the back. Use an extra fork in serving. If all the fowl be not required, carve only from one side, leaving the opposite side whole for another meal.</p></section>

Succotash is the great dish in Plymouth at every celebration of Forefathers' Day, December 22. Tradition says it has been made in that town ever since the Pilgrims raised their first corn and beans, and it is supposed they learned to make it from the Indians.</p><p>Strangers are rather shy of this peculiar mixture; but it is a favorite dish with the natives, and to this day is made by some families many times through the winter season. Although the dish has never been made by the writer, it has been tested by her in that ancient town many times, and the excellence of the following receipt is unquestionable.

When boiling, change the water, and simmer until soft enough to mash to a pulp and the water is nearly all absorbed. Wash the salt pork and the corned beef, which should be corned only three or four days. Put them on about eight o'clock, in cold water, in a very large kettle, and skim as they begin to boil. Clean, and truss the chicken as for boiling, and put it with the meat about an hour and a quarter before dinner time. Allow a longer time if a fowl be used, and keep plenty of water in the kettle. Two hours before dinner time, put the beans, mashed to a pulp, and the hulled corn into another kettle, with some of the fat from the meat in the bottom to keep them from sticking. Take out enough liquor from the meat to cover the corn and beans, and let them simmer where they will not burn. Stir often, and add more liquor if needed. The mixture should be like a thick soup, and the beans should absorb all the liquor, yet it must not be too dry.</p><p>Pare, and cut the turnip into inch slices; add it about eleven o'clock, and the potatoes (pared) half an hour later. Take up the chicken as soon as tender, that it may be served whole. Serve the beef and pork together, the chicken, turnip, and potatoes each on separate dishes, and the beans and corn in a <implement>tureen.</implement> The meat usually salts the mixture sufficiently, and no other seasoning is necessary. Save the water left from the meat, to use in warming the corn and beans the next day, serving the meat cold. This will keep several days in cold weather; and, like many other dishes, it is better the oftener it is warmed over, so there is no objection to making a large quantity. The white Southern corn is considered the only kind suitable for this ancient dinner.</p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>VEGETABLE food, in its widest sense, includes some part of every form of plant growth,--herb, shrub, or tree,--used either as vegetables, fruits, grains, condiments, or beverages. Vegetables, as the term is generally used, are such plants as are cultivated for culinary purposes. They comprise a variety of the parts of the plant,--roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruit.</p><p>Before studying vegetables proper, it may be interesting for those who have never considered food from a botanical point of view to glance at the various forms of vegetable growth commonly used as food.</p><p>Beginning with <emph rend="italic">roots,</emph> we find, among fleshy roots, the carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, salsify, and radish, which are cooked in their natural state or used raw. Also from roots we get ginger, arrowroot, and tapioca. <emph rend="italic">Rootstocks,</emph> or stems growing underground, consist of <emph rend="italic">tubers,</emph> like the potato, yam, and artichoke, and of scaly <emph rend="italic">bulbs,</emph> like the onion, chives, leek, and garlic. <emph rend="italic">Stems</emph> we eat in asparagus; and whole <emph rend="italic">trunks</emph> of trees are felled and used in making sago, which is the <emph rend="italic">pith</emph> of a species of palm-tree.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Leaves</emph> include lettuce, endive, spinach, parsley, cabbage, and greens of various kinds. <emph rend="italic">Dried leaves</emph> and <emph rend="italic">flowers</emph> are used in the form of tea, sage, thyme, bay leaves, tobacco, marjoram, savory, and other herbs. <emph rend="italic">Leaf stalks</emph> include celery and rhubarb; <emph rend="italic">flower stalks,</emph> cauliflower and globe artichokes. The <emph rend="italic">juices</emph> of vegetables furnish many forms of food, --sugar, acids, honey, oil, gum, and wines. The <emph rend="italic">bark</emph> we use in cinnamon. <emph rend="italic">Unexpanded flower-buds</emph> are pickled, as in capers, or dried, as in cloves. Ripe cloves have no aroma.</p><p>Many <emph rend="italic">seeds</emph> or <emph rend="italic">berries</emph> are gathered green, and are then dried for use. Allspice, or Jamaica pepper, cassia buds,
 
<pb n="290" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=310"/>

long peppers, and black pepper are of this class. Mustard and celery <emph rend="italic">seeds</emph> are used as well as the leaves. Nutmegs are <emph rend="italic">seeds;</emph> and mace is the <emph rend="italic">aril,</emph> or covering, of the nutmeg. <emph rend="italic">Seed vessels</emph> are used green, as in string beans, and also dried and ground, as in cayenne pepper. <emph rend="italic">Farinaceous seeds</emph> or <emph rend="italic">grains</emph> include wheat, rye, oats, corn, barley, rice, and buckwheat. They have a thin seed vessel adhering closely to the whole surface of the seed. <emph rend="italic">Oleaginous seeds</emph> contain oil and starch, like the cocoanut, walnut, chestnut, almond, etc. <emph rend="italic">Leguminous seeds</emph> are enclosed in pods, as peas, beans, lentils, etc.</p><p>Under the general name of fruit we eat very different things. <emph rend="italic">Fleshy fruits,</emph> like grapes, tomatoes, gooseberries, blueberries, cranberries, and currants, are <emph rend="italic">pulpy seed vessels.</emph> Oranges and lemons are <emph rend="italic">pulpy seed vessels,</emph> with a thick <emph rend="italic">leathery rind.</emph> Squashes, melon, cucumbers, egg-plant, etc., are <emph rend="italic">fleshy fruits</emph> with a <emph rend="italic">hard rind.</emph> Chocolate is made from the seed of a <emph rend="italic">fleshy fruit.</emph> In checkerberries, quinces, and in all parts of the apple and pear but the core, we eat a <emph rend="italic">fleshy, enlarged calyx.</emph> In peaches, plums, apricots, cherries, and other stone fruits, we eat the <emph rend="italic">outer part</emph> of a <emph rend="italic">pericarp</emph> or <emph rend="italic">seed vessel.</emph> Olives belong to this class, and are used green and in the form of oil expressed from the fleshy pericarp. Coffee is the <emph rend="italic">seed</emph> of a <emph rend="italic">stone fruit.</emph> In figs we eat a <emph rend="italic">hollow flower stalk,</emph> grown pulpy, and the inside lined with a great number of flowers.

<p>Some of the lower orders of vegetation afford valuable food. Irish and Ceylon mosses are <emph rend="italic">seaweeds.</emph> Iceland moss is a <emph rend="italic">lichen.</emph> Truffles and mushrooms are a species of <emph rend="italic">fungi</emph> of vegetable growth, but possessing a strong meaty or animal flavor.</p><p>We need a large variety of vegetables in our food to promote perfect health. Vegetables are rich in saline substances which counteract the evil effect of too much animal food. Some are rich in organic acids, and many abound in indigestible ligneous tissues which are useful in certain conditions. Those which contain starch and albumen and which can be stored for use during the winter months are considered the most valuable. All vegetables need the addition of salt and butter, or some form of fat, and many are rendered less indigestible by seasoning with pepper. Peas, beans, squashes, beets, turnips, etc., which contain sugar, should be slightly sweetened, as much of the natural sweetness is lost in cooking; and those containing potash salts, as cabbage and lettuce, need an acid condiment. Beans, peas, and other vegetables, which are difficult of digestions, are less indigestible if eaten in the form of pur&#233;es.</p><p>Green vegetables should be freshly gathered, thoroughly washed in cold water, and cooked in freshly boiling salted water. It is impossible to give a definite time for cooking, as much depends upon their age and the time they have been gathered. Wilted vegetables require a much longer time than fresh. All vegetables should be cooked until soft and tender, and no longer. This is better ascertained by watching them carefully and piercing with a fork than by depending upon any time-table. Vegetables which are eaten raw and are liable to ferment in the stomach are usually dressed with some condiment,--oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper.</p><p>Every green vegetable keeps its color better if it be boiled rapidly and uncovered. Many use soda for the same purpose, but unwisely.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Potatoes.</hd>
<p>The potato is more generally used than any other vegetable. It combines with other foods--meats particularly--to give the desired elements. But it should not be used alone, or in too great a proportion, as it gives very little flesh-forming material. When taken exclusively, such a large bulk of it is required for sustenance that it results in increased size and prominence of the stomach, which sometimes amounts to deformity.</p><p>Potatoes are three fourths water. The solid matter consists largely of starch, with a small quantity of albumen and mineral matter held in solution in the juices. The quantity of starch increases during the autumn, and remains stationary during the winter. In spring, when germination commences, the starch is changed to gum, and renders the potatoes mucilaginous. The sugar formed from this gum renders them sweeter. Potatoes which have been frozen until ready to use, or used immediately after thawing in cold water. The sprouts on potatoes should be removed as soon as they appear, since, if they are allowed to grow, they exhaust the starch, and render the potatoes unfit for food. Potatoes should be kept in a dry, cool cellar.</p><p>Botanically, potatoes belong to the same poisonous order as tobacco and deadly nightshade, and contain an acid juice which is unpleasant to the taste and often renders them indigestible. This lies in and near the rind of the potato. It is drawn out by heat. When the potatoes are baked it escapes in the steam, if they are opened at once; and when they are boiled, it is absorbed by the water. It is not wasteful, therefore, to peel potatoes before cooking, or to take off quite a thick peel, as they are thus rendered more wholesome. Taste the water in which potatoes have been boiled, and you will have no

<p>The cauliflower and cabbage contain more gluten, and are therefore more nutritious, than any other vegetable food. They should be eaten with fat and oily food, and require an acid, like lemon juice or vinegar, as a condiment. Cabbage is considered indigestible, and many boil with it a small piece of red pepper to counteract this effect. If the water in which cabbage is boiled be changed two or three times, less of the strong odor and flavor is retained. With proper treatment this vegetable may be served as temptingly as any other. It is more wholesome when served in its raw state as a salad than when cooked.</p>

<p>The eatable mushroom first appears very small, and of a round button shape, on a short underground stalk. At this stage it is all white.

<p>Rice should be thoroughly washed. Turn the rice into a coarse strainer, and place the strainer in a deep dish of cold water.

No doubt much that is sold as olive oil is made from cotton seed; but if it were sold under its right name and at a reasonable price there would be no objection to its use. When properly purified, and sweet, it may be as wholesome as olive oil. They are both vegetable oils, which are always considered more nutritious than animal oils. Oil is one of the best forms of fat we can use, and aids in digestion.

<hd align="center" size="larger">PASTRY AND PIES.</hd>
<p>PUFF PASTE, when skilfully made, is light and tender, and so delicate that it cannot be touched without crushing. It should be thoroughly baked, and is therefore more suitable for tarts and patties and the upper crust of pies. Eat it sparingly; unless you have a good digestion, and exercise freely, never eat it. It is, however, less injurious than the ordinary pastry seen on many tables, as it contains no more shortening than much of the pastry made with a "guess measure" of lard. It is not so much the amount of fat the paste contains that makes it indigestible, as the inferior quality of the fat, such as rancid butter or impure lard, or the soggy, greasy, half-cooked paste.</p><p>Pastry that is light, dry, and flaky is more easily separated by the gastric fluids than that which is heavy. Many housekeepers use lard in making pastry, as it is cheaper than butter, and makes a softer and more tender crust. Butter is more wholesome, and is preferable if you wish to make a brown crust. A mixture of half lard and half butter answers very well for common paste, but for puff paste butter alone should be used. In French receipts for puff paste eggs are considered essential, but there is no necessity for their use.</p><p>It requires practice to make puff paste well; and as there are so many other dishes more easily made and vastly more important, it is better not to waste time and strength upon it. Let your ambition as a housekeeper soar higher than perfection in making puff paste. But those who <emph rend="italic">will</emph> have it may observe the following directions.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose rend="italic">Puff Paste.</purpose>

--<emph rend="italic">One pound</emph> of the <ingredient rend="italic">best butter,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">one pound</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">pastry flour,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">one scant teaspoonful</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">salt,</ingredient> about <emph rend="italic">one</emph>
 
<pb n="317" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=337"/>

<emph rend="italic">cup</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">ice water.</ingredient> By measure, use <emph rend="italic">one quart</emph> of <emph rend="italic">flour</emph> and <emph rend="italic">one pint</emph> of <emph rend="italic">butter.</emph> Scald the bowl, then fill with cold water. Dip the hands into hot and then into cold water; this makes bowl and hands smooth, and keeps the butter from sticking. Wash the butter, by working it in the cold water, till soft and waxy. Divide into four parts; pat each part into a long and narrow piece, and wrap in a clean napkin.</p><p>Have three shallow oblong pans that will fit the one into the other. Fill the largest and smallest of the pans with broken ice. Put the butter, covered with the napkin, into the other, and place it between the two pans of ice to harden. Mix the salt with the flour, then break in one quarter of the butter. Rub with the tips of the fingers, and keep plenty of flour between the fingers and the butter. Many prefer to chop it, that the warmth of the hand may not soften the butter. When the butter and flour are well mixed, and fine and dry like meal, pour in the cup of ice water slowly. Mix with a knife, and cut, rather than stir. Wet only part of the flour at first and toss it to one side of the bowl, then wet another part; and when it is all of the proper consistency, cut and mix it together till it can be taken up clean from the bowl with the knife. Add the last of the water cautiously, wetting only the dry flour, and use less or more than the cupful as the flour may require. If the butter be softened by the heat in rubbing, it will moisten the flour, and less water will be required. But it should not be allowed to soften. The mixture should be light and dry, like separate minute crumbs of butter coated with flour.</p><p>Use a large smooth rolling-board and a glass rolling-pin. Put half a cup of flour in the dredger, and sprinkle the middle of the board with a light coating of flour. Toss the ball of paste in the flour with a knife until floured all over, then pat with the rolling-pin into a flat cake an inch thick. Have the end of the board next you, that you may roll the paste the required length. Hold the handles of the pin firmly, and roll with a light quick stroke as far as
 
<pb n="318" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=338"/>

your arms will allow,--the whole length of the paste, if possible, at every stroke. Do not attempt to roll the paste when it is in a ball or a cubical form, but pat it lightly, to make as large and flat a surface as possible before rolling. Roll out to the thickness of one third of an inch, and to a rectangular form. Lay one of the quarters of butter in a little flour on the corner of the board, and roll quickly into a long thin piece; scrape it up with a knife, and lay along the middle of the whole length of the paste. Fold over one side of the paste, then the other, letting the edges just meet in the middle of the butter. <emph rend="italic">Do not pat it down.</emph> Then fold each end to the middle and double again. Pound into a flat cake and roll again one quarter of an inch thick. Roll another piece of butter thin, lay it on the paste, fold the sides over, then the ends over, and then together, and repeat the process with the remaining pieces of butter. When the butter is all rolled in, the paste may be folded, patted, and rolled out, two, three, or seven times, as your strength will permit. Twice is enough for pies, three or four times for patties; but more are needed for a vol-au-vent.</p><p>When the butter is of the right texture, fine, smooth, and firm, not dry and crumbly, and the mixing and rolling are done so quickly and deftly that the butter does not soften, the paste will not stick, and very little flour will be required in rolling. Do not strike a hard blow in rolling, nor press the paste down to the board, but roll with a light gentle stroke. When the paste does not slip along the board, you may know it is sticking, and it must be lifted at once, the board scraped clean, and floured slightly.</p><p>Should the paste become soft and sticky, fold again, and pat it out to the size of the pan, and put it in the napkin between the two pans of ice. It will harden in ten minutes, and then may be rolled easily. After all the butter is in the dough, cut in two pieces, then roll and fold one, while the other is in the ice pan. Keep the board and pin wiped dry, and use only a little flour, but use enough to keep the paste from sticking.</p>
 
<pb n="319" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=339"/>

<p>Keep the edges even while rolling, and fold evenly, that there may be an equal number of layers in all parts. Each time the paste is folded over the butter a small amount of air is enclosed and is retained, unless the fold be patted down and allow the air to escape at the end. These bubbles of air may be plainly seen when the ball of dough is patted and rolled out, and care must be taken not to let the air escape. For this reason roll <emph rend="italic">lightly</emph> and always <emph rend="italic">from you,</emph> as a hard motion back and forth is more liable to break the bubbles. Roll with a fan-like sweep, a little to the right and left, to widen it and keep the rectangular shape; then roll gently on the edge nearest you, to make it of uniform thickness. The more of the bubbles you can retain in the paste, the lighter and more puffy it will be. The number of folds or layers of butter and paste makes the paste flaky, but the amount of air in it makes it rise and puff in baking.</p><p>The paste should be folded and rolled till no streaks of butter can be seen. After the last rolling, place it on the ice to harden, as it may then be cut and shaped more easily.</p><p><emph rend="italic">To Bake Puff Paste.</emph>--The dough should be icy cold when it is put into the oven. If the patties soften after being shaped, place them between the pans of ice till they are hard. The oven should be about as hot as for rolls, with the heat greater underneath, that the paste may rise nearly to its full height before browning; then quicken the fire to brown the tops, and turn the heat from underneath or put a pan or grate under to prevent burning. If the oven be too hot, the paste will burn before it is risen; if too slow, it will melt and spread.</p></recipe>

<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Patty Shells, Tarts, Vol-au-vents, and other Forms of Puff Paste.</hd>
<p>There are two ways of shaping the paste for patties and tarts. First, roll puff paste one eighth of an inch thick, and stamp out circular pieces with a cutter, two and
 
<pb n="320" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=340"/>

one half inches in diameter. With a smaller cutter stamp out the centres from half of these pieces, leaving rings half an inch wide. Dip the cutters in hot water, and cut quickly, that the edges may not be pressed together or cut unevenly. Rub a little white of egg on the top of the large rounds near the edge, put on the rings, and press them lightly to make them adhere, but be careful not to get any egg on the edges, as that will prevent them from rising. Put round pieces of stale bread, cut half an inch thick, in the centre, to keep the paste from rising and filling the cavity. Bake on shallow pans lined with paper, and when done remove the bread and soft paste underneath. Bake the small pieces cut from the centre on a pan by themselves, as they take less time for baking. In serving place them on the top of the shells for a cover.</p><p>Another way is to roll the paste one fourth of an inch thick, cut with a <implement>round cutter,</implement> and then with the smaller cutter cut nearly through the centre of each round, making a rim half an inch wide. After baking remove the centre crust and soft part underneath, without breaking through, as then the shell will not hold any liquid mixture. Some persons prefer this method; but there is less waste when cut in the first way, as the parts cut out may be baked for covers, and usually prove to be the most delicate part of the paste. Or, if covers are not wanted, these centres may be rolled out thinner, and used as bottom pieces.</p><p>The paste for patties is usually rolled one fourth of an inch thick and cut with a plain cutter. Two or three rims may be put on when a deeper shell is desired. Any kind of delicate cooked meat or fish (chicken, sweetbreads, oysters, lobster, etc.) may be cut into small pieces, and warmed in a thick <ref target="creamsauce1">cream sauce</ref> (see <ref target="linc298.jpg">page 278</ref>), and served hot in patty shells, with a cover of the paste.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Pies.</hd>
<p>For <emph rend="italic">Pies,</emph> roll the puff paste out a quarter of an inch thick, then roll up, and cut from the end of the roll. Turn each piece on the side, so that the folds show in rings, and pat out flat, then roll to fit the plate. Keep the paste in a circular form, and roll evenly in every direction. Make slightly larger than the plate, as the paste shrinks when taken from the board, and should be fulled in rather than stretched to the required size. After a little practice it is just as easy to judge of the amount of paste required for one crust, and roll it in this way to fit the plate, as to roll so large a quantity that the edges have to be trimmed off and mixed with the remainder of the paste. Roll some of the paste, and cut into strips three quarters of an inch wide; wet the under crust and place the rim on the edge. Use one rim for pies which are to be covered, and two, if you

Roll the upper crust larger than the plate, make a cut in the centre to let the steam escape, wet the rims, put the crust on the edge even with the rim and slightly fuller in the centre, to allow for shrinking in baking; otherwise the crust, as it is forced up by the steam within, will draw away from the edge.</p><p>Wet every spot of the rim and edge, and press closely but lightly together, to keep the juices from boiling out. All pies, meat pies especially, with a top crust should have several holes cut in the crust to let the steam escape. All fruit pies are better flavored if made with fresh, rather than stewed, fruits. If to be filled with juicy fruit, or cream, they are more wholesome prepared as follows: Bake the two crusts separately, stew the fruit, fill, and put the two together. Or fill with a mock filling of pieces of clean cloth, bake, remove the cloth, and just before serving fill with the prepared fruit.</p><p>Pies should bake from half to three quarters of an hour, or till <emph rend="italic">brown.</emph> Use tin plates, as pies bake better on the bottom in them. No greasing is needed, and the pies should be changed to earthen plates as soon as done.</p>

when using the old preparation of isinglass and gelatine. Much of the strength and flavor for jellies is lost in clearing them with eggs. Use Cox's gelatine for jellies and Nelson's for cream. Cox's gelatine makes the clearest jelly, and the fishy taste is destroyed by the strong flavoring used in making wine, lemon, or orange jelly. Nelson's gelatine is finer, softens quicker, and has a more agreeable flavor. It is therefore better adapted to creams and delicate dishes.</p><p>Never cook gelatine.

<hd rend="bold" align="center">Whipped Cream.</hd>
<p>Many wholesome, delicious, and attractive dishes may be made with whipped cream. To those who can obtain plenty of cream, these dishes afford a cheaper, more easily prepared, and far more satisfactory course than pie and many forms of hot puddings. Many of them are equally suitable for tea. Very rich cream should be diluted and well mixed with an equal quantity of milk. The best quality of cream obtained from the milkman is usually of the proper consistency. Thin cream will become liquid after whipping, and thick cream will turn to butter. The cream should always be icy cold; when it is to be served as a garnish, or for cream whips, it should be sweetened and flavored before it is whipped.</p><p>A <implement>whip churn</implement> is the best utensil for whipping cream. This is a tin cylinder, perforated at the bottom and sides, and having a perforated dasher. When the churn is placed in a bowl of cream, and the dasher worked up and down, the air is forced from the cylinder into the cream, causing it to become light and frothy. A <implement>Dover egg-beater</implement> will make the cream light, but it has a different consistency from that obtained by churning.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose rend="italic">To Whip Cream.</purpose>

--Place a bowl half filled with <ingredient>cream</ingredient> in a pan of broken ice. When very cold, put the <implement>churn</implement> into the cream, hold the cylinder firmly, and keep the cover in place with the left hand. Tip the <implement>churn</implement> slightly, that the cream may flow out at the bottom. Work the dasher with a <emph rend="italic">light short stroke up,</emph> and a <emph rend="italic">hard, pushing stroke down.</emph> When the froth appears, stir it down once or twice, as the first bubbles are too large; and when the bowl is full of froth, skim it off into a <implement>granite pan</implement> placed on ice. Take off the <emph rend="italic">froth</emph> only, and do not take it off below the holes in the cylinder, as it whips better when they are covered. For this reason never whip a pint of cream in a three-quart bowl, and do not try to whip it all, as usually a little is left in the bowl which is too thin to whip.</p><p>One pint of cream should treble in whipping. If for a garnish, drain the whipped cream on a <implement>hair sieve</implement> placed over a pan, and keep it on ice till stiff enough to keep its shape. Creams that are to be moulded are made stiffer by the addition of gelatine.</p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">ICE-CREAM AND SHERBET.</hd>
<p>A GOOD <implement>ice-cream freezer</implement> should be in every kitchen; for with it a great variety of wholesome and attractive dishes may be prepared with very little expenditure of time and strength. Fruit, cream, and eggs, when frozen, are more palatable in hot weather than when served in other ways. A deep can, four inches in diameter, with a tight cover fitting outside the can, and packed in a <implement>firkin</implement> with ice and salt, makes a good substitute for a freezer. By scraping the cream from the sides and beating occasionally with a large <implement>bread-knife</implement> as the cream freezes, one may have a very smooth quality of cream with very little effort.</p><p>But whether with a patent or home-made freezer, the essential points are to have the ice finely crushed, to use the right proportion of coarse rock salt, and to beat the mixture thoroughly during the freezing. Salt has a great affinity for water, and when mixed with broken ice it unites with the water; the ice, in changing from its solid form to a liquid, parts with its heat, and the mixture of melted ice and salt is many degrees colder than the ice alone. This is sufficient to reduce to the freezing-point the temperature of any liquid placed in the ice and salt. The finer the ice is crushed, the quicker it melts; and the more the mixture is stirred, the sooner all parts become chilled. The melted ice and salt should surround the can, and not be drawn off as fast as melted. For this reason it is a mistake to have the outlet for the water in the bottom of the <implement>firkin.</implement> It should be just below the top of the can, and then the water will run out before it can get inside the can. Draw it off whenever it floats the ice. The ice should be nearly as fine as the salt. Use one part
 
<pb n="362" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=382"/>

salt to three or four parts ice. An easy way is to measure each with a saucer or small shallow pan. Put in a layer of ice three inches deep (pack it in solidly), then a measure of salt (sprinkle it evenly on the ice), then three measures of ice and one of salt, etc., till the freezer is full. Pack each layer in closely with a wooden paddle, and turn the freezer handle occasionally while packing. Be sure that the freezer works perfectly before adding the cream. The bearings and gears should be kept well oiled. When the cream is thoroughly cold, pour it into the can. Turn slowly at first, and after ten minutes more rapidly, till you can turn no longer. It usually takes about half an hour. Remove the beater, scrape off the cream, and beat and pack the cream closely in the can. Put a cork into the opening in the cover, and lay the cross-piece over to keep the can down in the ice. Cover with a piece of old carpeting wet in the salt and water. If the ice and salt have been well packed, and the cream is to be served within an hour and not moulded, no more ice will be needed; but if to be kept longer, draw off the water and pack again. If to be moulded, beat the cream well, and pack into the mould; cover closely, and bury in ice and salt.</p><p>After using the freezer, clean and scald the can; dry thoroughly, and keep it uncovered while not in use. Drain the salt left in the freezer, and use again. A mixture of salt and snow answers when ice cannot be obtained. Use Turk's Island or <emph rend="italic">coarse rock salt,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">not</emph> what is called coarse fine salt.</p>

</p><p>Make a boiled custard with the milk, sugar, and the yolks of the eggs. Cook it slightly till smooth, but not curdled.

If cream cannot be obtained, beat the <ingredient>whites of the eggs</ingredient> till foamy, and add them just before freezing. No matter how many eggs are used, a little cream, if not more than half a cupful, is a decided improvement to all ice-creams. It is better to make sherbet, or fruit and water ices, than an inferior quality of ice-cream with milk. Ice-creams are richer and mould better when made with gelatine; but care must be taken to flavor highly, to disguise the taste of the gelatine.

<hd align="center" size="larger">GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CAKE.</hd>
<p>STUDY first the directions given under Measuring, Mixing, and Baking.</p><p>Cake is a mixture of part or all of the following materials: eggs, sugar or molasses, flour, butter or cream, milk or water, fruit, soda, cream of tartar, spices, etc.</p><p>An unlimited variety of cakes may be made by varying the proportions of these materials, and to the same proportions many different names are given. Many amusing experiences are known of the eagerness with which a newly named receipt for cake is received, which, after many trials, has been found to be an old receipt arranged in a different order. An analysis of the hundreds of receipts given in books devoted to cake-making would show that the general principles involved may be included under two divisions, namely, receipts for <emph rend="italic">sponge cakes,</emph> made <emph rend="italic">without butter;</emph> and <emph rend="italic">pound</emph> or <emph rend="italic">cup cakes,</emph> made <emph rend="italic">with butter.</emph> Sponge cakes are made rich with eggs, the lightness depending wholly upon the amount of air beaten into the egg; or an inferior quality is sometimes made by substituting soda and cream of tartar for part of the eggs, and adding more flour and some liquid, usually water. They vary in color, according as the white or yolk of the egg is used. Butter cakes are varied in the same way, and also by the addition of fruit, or spices, or various coloring and flavoring materials.</p><p>There is no one department in cooking where so much depends upon the baking as in making cake. The fire should be rather low, but sufficient to last through the entire baking. In many stoves it is exceedingly difficult to bake cake by a morning fire; as so much coal is put on,
 
<pb n="370" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=390"/>

the fire is too hot and cannot be checked sufficiently. The oven should be less hot than for bread. If too hot, leave the oven door open for ten minutes before putting in the cake, then watch it, and protect it by putting over it a covering of paper, or a pan on the grate above. Do not attempt to make cake unless you can have entire control of the fire.</p><p>Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in thick loaves. If the oven be not hot enough at first, or be cooled too suddenly during the baking, the cake will not be light. Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly than others. Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to twenty minutes, thicker cakes from thirty to forty minutes, very thick loaves about an hour, and fruit cake from two to three hours. Whichever kind you are baking, divide the time required into quarters. During the first quarter the heating is not manifested in appearance except by the rising; during the second the cake should continue to rise and begin to brown; then should become all over a rich golden brown; and in the last quarter settle a little, brown in the cracks, and shrink from the pan. Be careful not to take it out too soon. If necessary to move it, do it very gently, and never move it when it has risen to the full height, but is not browned or fixed in its shape.</p><p>If cake brown before rising, the oven is too hot. When it rises more in the centre, cracks open, and stays up, it is too stiff with flour. It should rise first on the edges, then in the middle, crack slightly, settle to a level again, when the cracks usually come together. Nothing is more suggestive of bakeshop cake, or inferior quality in material, than a loaf with an upper surface having sharp edges, then hollows, and a peaked centre, as if the inside of the cake had boiled up and run out over the top.</p><p>Line your cake tins with paper, to prevent burning the bottom and edges and to aid in removing the cake from the pans. Lay the paper over the outside of the pan, and crease it round the edge of the bottom. Allow it large enough to come above the top of the pan. Fold in the
 
<pb n="371" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=391"/>

middle lengthwise and crosswise, and cut out the open corners to the crease made by the pan. Then fit it into the inside of the pan, and grease the paper, not the pan, with fresh butter or lard. Many use a rag tied on a stick; others grease with a brush. Nice brushes are very expensive (and no others are suitable), and unless carefully cleaned are quite objectionable. Rags and paper absorb the grease which should be put on the pan, and in any case the fingers should be washed after the process. So there is no quicker, easier, or more economical way of greasing a tin than to rub the butter on with the fingers.</p><p>Mix cake in an earthen bowl, and never in a tin pan. Use a wooden spoon, as iron spoons discolor the hand and the mixture. Use only the best materials. Go without cake rather than try to make it, or eat it when made, with what is called cooking butter and second-rate eggs. Such cake cannot be good or wholesome. Wash the butter, if very salt. Brown sugar is good for fruit cake, but for all other varieties use the finest granulated or powdered sugar. Very coarse granulated sugar makes heavy cake, with a hard and sticky crust. The flour should be dry. When it has been kept in a cool place it should be slightly warmed, and always sifted before using. St. Louis flour--or pastry flour, as it is sometimes called--is best for cake. When new-process flour is used, take one eighth less. Soda, cream of tartar, and baking-powders should be crushed and sifted into the flour, then sifted two or three times with the flour. Mix spices with the flour or with the sugar. Mix a little of the measure of flour with the fruit to keep it from sticking together or settling. If the sugar be lumpy, crush and sift before using. Eggs should be fresh, and cooled by keeping in cold water or in the <implement>ice-chest.</implement> The yolks and whites should be beaten separately. Break each egg on the edge of the cup, just enough to crack the middle of the shell, so the white will flow out, but not hard enough to break into the yolks. Then hold the egg over the cup, with the cracked side up, and break it apart. Let the
 
<pb n="372" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=392"/>

white run into the cup, and keep the yolk in the half shell until all the white is drained off. Be careful not to break the yolk, as the smallest portion of it in the whites will prevent them from frothing. Beat the yolks in a bowl, and the whites in a platter if you use a fork or <implement>whisk,</implement> or in a bowl if you use a Dover beater. Never stop beating the whites until they are stiff and dry, as it is impossible to have them light if they become liquid again.</p><p>Measure all the ingredients, and have the fire and all utensils ready, before you begin to mix. Observe the following order in putting materials together.</p><p id="gendirsponge"><emph rend="italic">Sponge Cake Mixtures.</emph>--Beat the yolks until light or lemon-colored and thick. Add the sugar gradually, and beat again. Add the lemon juice or flavoring, and water, if that is to be used. Beat the whites until stiff and dry, and cut or fold them in lightly, then sift in the flour, and fold in carefully without any stirring. Sponge cakes should not be beaten after adding the flour. Those made with soda and cream of tartar require less beating than those without, but they are a very poor substitute for genuine sponge cake.</p><p id="gendirbutter"><emph rend="italic">Butter Cake Mixtures.</emph>--Warm the bowl with hot water, then wipe dry. Put in the butter, and rub with a wooden or silver spoon until light and creamy. Be careful not to have the bowl so hot as to melt the butter. Add the sugar and beat again. If the habit of rubbing the butter and sugar together with the hand be already formed, and you find it easier than to use a spoon, it is hardly worth while to change; but for those who are wholly inexperienced it is better to learn to use the spoon, and every lady would prefer to have her cook mix in that way. If the proportion of sugar be large for the butter,--more than double,--beat part of the sugar with the butter, and the remainder with the yolks of the eggs. Where a very small proportion of butter is to be used, it may be melted and mixed with the eggs and sugar. Beat the yolks till light and thick, then beat them well with the butter and sugar. Add the 
 
<pb n="373" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=393"/>

flavoring. Then add a little milk, then a little flour, and milk again, and continue until all the milk and flour are used. Lastly, add the beaten whites. All cakes made with butter require to be beaten long and vigorously after adding the flour, that they may be smooth and fine-grained. Fruit should be added last; cake with fruit should be a little stiffer with flour than that without fruit. Citron and large pieces of fruit may be put in in layers, or spread over the dough in the pan.</p><p>All cake should be baked as soon as possible after it is mixed. Put the scrapings from the bowl into small tins. If put into the loaf, they sometimes cause a heavy streak through the top.</p><p>Cake is baked when it shrinks from the pan and stops hissing, or when a straw inserted in the centre comes out clean. Remove the loaf from the pan as soon as baked, lifting it out by the paper; or, if not papered, loosen the edges with a knife, and turn the pan over upon a cloth laid over a <implement>bread-cooler.</implement> Remove the pan as soon as possible. Never let cake stand in the pan to become moist. When cake is baked too hard or burned, rub off the burned surface with a coarse <implement>grater.</implement></p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">FRUIT.</hd>
<p>IT would be a great saving of time and work, give a pleasing variety to bills of fare, and be above all a great promoter of health, if people would use ripe fruit abundantly in its season at their tables (not between meals). With the markets bountifully supplied with many varieties of fruit, it is to be regretted that it cannot be found at every table at least once a day. Much of the money spent for some kinds of meat would be better expended for fruit. A simple course of fruit is all that is needed after a dinner, and is much more wholesome than pies. But it is so hard for some people to break away from old customs that it will be long before housekeepers generally will be content to serve the queen of all fruits, the apple, in its natural state instead of making it into the "persistent pie," over the preparation of which many women toil, for naught save the fear that they may be considered shiftless if they have n't a pie in the house.</p><p>Ripe fruit is especially appropriate at the breakfast-table, and may be taken before or after the principal dishes, according to individual needs and taste. Some people require the acid of oranges or grapes before they can eat anything substantial; others might be made ill by their use at that time, but be benefited by them afterwards.</p><p>All fruit should be served as fresh and cold as possible. A dish of fruit which has been kept from day to day in a warm room may answer for an ornament, but it is not tempting to the palate. Only sound, fresh fruit should appear at the table.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose rend="italic">Apples</purpose>

for table use should have a pleasant spicy flavor, not too acid, and should be wiped clean, or polished if you prefer the street-vender's style.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose rend="italic">Oranges</purpose>

may be served whole or cut. Many slice them across the sections; but the presence of the seeds and tough inner skin is objectionable. A better way is to remove all the rind and white skin, divide into sections, then with the point of a silver <implement>fruit-knife</implement> cut off the inner skin in the middle, slip out the seeds, and cut each section into three pieces. Never serve with the seeds left in, nor sweeten until just before serving. A neat way to peel an orange is to cut the rind from the ends and leave a strip round the middle, then open, leaving the sections on the strip of peel. Or cut the oranges in halves crosswise without peeling, sprinkle with <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and eat with a spoon.</p></recipe>

<emph rend="italic">huckleberries</emph> make delicious jelly. Crab apples and quinces will form jelly easily; but grapes are unreliable, and currants, if not gathered at the proper time, will sometimes fail. Cherries and some other fruits require the addition of gelatine. Berries, currants, and grapes require no water. Simply mash them in their own juice. Apples, peaches, and quinces should be stewed in as little water as possible, then mashed, and the juice strained. The juices of fruits contain a gelatinous substance called pectose, or pectic acid, which is soluble in the fruit juice, but has the property of coagulation when mixed with sugar, exposed to a slight heat, and then cooled. Sometimes the heat of the sun is sufficient, but usually a short but more intense heat is necessary. When the sugar has a bluish tinge, or when there is not enough sugar to absorb the water in the juice, or when the juice is unusually watery, as when the fruit is over-ripe, and the fruit is boiled a long time to evaporate this water, the mixture loses its gelatinous properties and becomes gummy, or, as disconsolate housekeepers say, "will not jelly."</p>

Stir it often to prevent burning. Boil the juice twenty minutes, and skim thoroughly. Add the hot sugar, and boil from three to five minutes, or till it thickens on a spoon when exposed to the air.

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Canning.</purpose>

Canning differs from preserving in that the fruit is kept, either with or without sugar, by sealing in air-tight jars or cans, and is not cooked long enough to destroy its natural flavor. Some authorities state that fruit may be kept by putting it in the jars, filling with cold water, and sealing immediately. But nearly all fruits are improved by the addition of more or less sugar. As a rule, all fruits that require sugar when fresh require it when canned.</p><p>The important points in canning are to have the fruit perfect in shape and quality; the syrup clear, rightly proportioned, and boiling hot; the jars hot and filled to overflowing, and sealed quickly and thoroughly, that no air may be left inside. Have all utensils in order and at hand, that there may be no needless delay. Large-mouthed glass jars with glass covers or porcelain-lined screw covers are the best. Pint jars are more convenient for a small family. They should be scalded, and the covers and rubbers clean and perfectly fitted. Keep the jars in hot water until ready to fill, or roll each one in hot water just before filling, or place them in a folded towel wrung out of hot water, and put a silver spoon or fork in the jar while filling. A clamp is a great convenience, as the jar may be held in the clamp directly over the kettle and filled very quickly. If without this, have a broad shallow pan, half filled with hot water, on the stove or on a table near by, and place the jars in it while filling them. A wide-mouthed <implement>tunnel</implement> aids in filling the jars. When the fruit is to be boiled in the jars, place a perforated tin or some flat stones or <implement>muffin rings</implement> in the <implement>boiler,</implement> to keep the jars from resting on the bottom. Then the water will be under as well as around the jar, and there will be no danger of breaking.</p><p>All ripe mellow fruit may be prepared and put at once into the jars. Place the jars in a <implement>boiler</implement> or kettle of warm water, with something underneath to avoid breaking. Make the syrup, using sugar according to taste, or in the proportion of <emph rend="italic">one cup</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">sugar</ingredient> and <emph rend="italic">one cup</emph> of <ingredient rend="italic">water</ingredient> for

Run the handle of a silver tablespoon down the inside of the jar, that the syrup may completely surround the fruit. Fasten the covers on securely, and give the screw an extra turn every half-hour until the fruit is cold. If the jars be kept bottom up and in a dark place, there is hardly a chance of failure. The best quality of thick tin-foil may be used as a cover for any large-mouthed bottle or jar minus a cover. Fill the jar with the fruit and syrup, cover with a large piece of tin-foil, work it down over the rim until perfectly smooth and tight. If air-tight, there will be a depression in the cover as soon as the fruit is cold. Fruit thus covered should be kept away from mice, as they will eat the tin-foil.</p><p>Canned fruit should be opened some time before using, that it may be aerated and the flavor improved. There has been a strong feeling against the use of fruit prepared in tin cans. Chemists have examined canned fruit as soon as opened, and found it harmless; but if the fruit be left

<hd align="center" size="larger">GENERAL HINTS ON CARING AND COOKING FOR INVALIDS.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Ventilation.</emph>--The first condition of comfort and recovery to the patient is that the room be perfectly ventilated, either directly or from fresh air in an adjoining room. A sunny exposure and an open fire, and in summer an open fireplace, are essential aids. After all these points are secured, care must be taken that the air be not vitiated by anything in the room. Growing plants are more healthful than cut flowers; unless the room be large and airy, the latter should not be allowed for any length of time, and even then should be removed as soon as their freshness is gone. If possible, avoid having a kerosene lamp in a sick-room. The odor is irritating to the mucous membrane, and in some conditions positively harmful. The wick should <emph rend="italic">never</emph> be turned below the point of free combustion, either in the room of the sick or well. If you wish a dim light, place the lamp outside the door, or shade it by a screen. <emph rend="italic">Never</emph> turn it down, as it will inevitably vitiate the atmosphere.</p><p>Avoid noise in replenishing the fire, by bringing the coal in a paper bag, and putting bag and all upon the fire. Keep all medicines and everything suggestive of a sick-room out of sight.</p><p><emph rend="italic">The Bed.</emph>--Arrange the bed so that the patient may be shielded from any draught. Neither sun nor lamp light should shine directly in the eyes. Whenever it is possible, change the position of the bed, furniture, and pictures, that the eye may have something new and interesting to dwell upon, if such changes interest instead of
 
<pb n="408" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=428"/>

distress the invalid. Two small beds, that the patient may find relief in change, are desirable; or, if possible, procure an invalid's bed, which admits of many changes of position and the airing and changing of the bed with no accompanying fatigue.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cleanliness.</emph>--It is of the first importance that the bed linen and clothing of the patient should be kept fresh by frequent changes, and thoroughly dried and aired. Be careful to supply the needed warmth by light but not over-abundant clothing. The patient should be bathed freely; avoid a chill by giving a sponge bath with alcohol and warm water, exposing only a part of the body at a time to the air, and rub till perfectly dry.</p><p>Wet a cotton-flannel bag, made with the nap side out, in cold water, wring it slightly, and tie it over the broom to use in sweeping. Be careful to wash it every time it is used. It is quite essential that the floor of a sick-room should be kept clean. Remove all dust with a damp cloth. The cleansing, drying, or airing of all objects should be done outside of the sick-room. Keep the room, the bed, the patient, and everything about yourself absolutely neat and clean.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Conversation.</emph>--In extreme sickness let no unnecessary word be spoken in a sick-room, and no needless, noisy, nor abrupt movements be made. Let the voice be calm and clear, neither loud nor whispering. In speaking to the patient do so in the way that requires the least effort in response, and never consult him about his food. Avoid all discussions of the disease, the medicine, and any exciting topic either with or before him. Do not excite the patient by needless conversation with the doctor outside of the sick-room. Never whisper, even when the patient is asleep or in delirium, because a whisper is more penetrating than a low full tone. During convalescence do not weary with conversation; let it always be bright and cheerful, and, as far as possible, of things outside the sick-room. Cultivate the power of talking to, rather than with, a sick person.</p>
 
<pb n="409" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=429"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Conveniences in a Sick-Room.</emph>--"In severe sickness a glass tube is useful for feeding drinks and gruels; and little white china boats with spouts are also good. A wooden tray with legs six or seven inches high, to stand upon the bed, is very convenient for serving meals."</p>
<formula class="household"><p><purpose rend="italic">To keep Ice for a Sick-Room.</purpose>

--Tie a square of coarse white flannel over a pitcher, leaving a cup-shaped depression of the flannel in the pitcher. Put <ingredient>broken ice</ingredient> in the flannel, and cover it tightly with a thicker flannel. The ice will keep all night, and the water may be poured off as wanted.</p></formula>

<p>In applying hot bandages dip the flannel in boiling water, place it in the centre of a coarse towel, and twist and wring the ends of the towel; or place the flannels in a <implement>steamer</implement> over hot water until penetrated with the steam; they will then need no wringing.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Feeding the Patient.</emph>--When feeding the patient, do it gently and neatly. Anticipate his wants, and let the food be a surprise as far as practicable. In severe sickness give nourishment in a <emph rend="italic">small quantity often,</emph> and never fail to give it immediately after a long sleep. During convalescence food should be given at longer, but regular intervals. If the patient be unable to use a toothbrush, wet a bit of soft cloth and wipe the teeth and gums, and give a little water or acid drink to soften the dry mucous membrane and destroy the bad taste in the mouth, before offering any food.</p><p>Let everything prepared for the invalid be arranged to please the eye as well as the palate. Serve less than you think the patient requires, and give as much variety as possible, serving in different forms or in different dishes if the material must be the same. Hot liquids should be <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> when they reach the patient, not merely when they leave the kitchen. Serve them in a hot pitcher, and pour only a little into the hot cup or bowl, and so avoid its running over into the saucer or too rapid cooling. Never insult the patient by offering him a slice of dough covered with charcoal, under the name of toast. When the meal is
 
<pb n="410" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=430"/>

over, remove immediately every trace of food from the room. Keep in the sick-room choice fruit or any delicacies which have been sent to the patient only long enough to gratify the eye, then remove to a cool place, and serve as fresh and daintily as possible.</p><p>Wines or liquors of any kind should never be given without the advice of a physician. Young persons do not need them, and, in any form of fever, stimulants are positively harmful. In some extreme cases, among very old people, or where there is a great lack of recuperative power, they may be given.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Visitors.</emph>--Visitors should never be admitted to a sick-room, except with the consent of the physician. Never visit a sick-room when in a violent perspiration or with an empty stomach, as then the system more readily receives contagion. If obliged to sit up all night with a patient, provide yourself with something to eat, if nothing more than a cake of chocolate, that there may be no needless exhaustion.</p><p>Not the least of the many qualifications desirable in a good nurse is a thorough knowledge of the nature, use, and digestibility, as well as the best methods of preparing different kinds of food, and of their adaptation to different forms of disease. Such knowledge is of still greater importance to every physician, and fully as essential as the study of drugs. Nurses, alas! are often wholly unqualified, or not to be obtained at all; and then that patient is fortunate, indeed, who has a physician who can in emergency fill the treble office of nurse, cook, and doctor.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Diet for the Invalid.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">First Condition.</emph>--Sometimes the system from over-taxation, either mental or physical, needs a period of complete rest or comparative inaction; or, as in the commencement of many forms of sickness, the diet should be food which merely satisfies the hunger and which soothes and reduces inflammation and quenches thirst, but does

<p><emph rend="italic">Another Condition</emph> in sickness occurs when, after long-continued, prostrating, or rapidly wasting disease, the system demands immediate nourishment to supply that waste, or when there is a lack of nutrition from any cause. Food that contains the most nourishment in the most easily assimilated form is now needed; but the physician should always be consulted as to the food suitable during the different diseases. <emph rend="italic">Liquid</emph> food is most suitable, and should be <emph rend="italic">food</emph> as well as drink. In nearly all cases of fever milk is given when the patient can take it. Two or three grains of pepsin in a cup of milk or broth facilitate its digestion. In typhoid fever milk has often proved of great value, and is now generally recommended by the medical faculty in all cases of scarlet fever, nervous disorder, and all diseases arising from imperfect nutrition. It keeps up the strength of the patient, acts well upon the stomach, soothes the intestines, and promotes sleep. It should be taken slowly to prevent the curdling in a dense mass which may occur if too much be taken at once. A pint of hot milk taken slowly every four hours, will often check the most violent diarrh&#x153;a and dysentery. It should never be boiled, only scalded.</p><p>Eggnog or broth, meat broth, farina and oatmeal gruel, and port wine jelly, are all suitable at such times; but beef juice and tea are most generally used by physicians. They afford a fluid and easily assimilated form of food, and have a remarkable power of restoring the vigorous action of the heart, and dissipating the sense of exhaustion following
 
<pb n="422" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=442"/>

severe, prolonged exertion. When taken alone, they are stimulating rather than nutritive, and a patient would soon starve if he did not have the addition of the fibrine of the meat or of some farinaceous food, like bread crumbs or oatmeal.</p></section>
<section class1="beverages" class2="medhealth">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Beef Essence and Beef Tea.</hd>
<p>Beef essence is the pure juice of the meat. This is given where a patient needs much nourishment in a small compass. Beef tea is the juice of the meat diluted with water. It is a mistake to think that any beef because it is lean or cheap is good enough for beef tea. It will do for the <implement>soup-kettle,</implement> but not for those who are ill. Meat for beef tea should be lean, juicy, and of good flavor. Every particle of fat, skin, and membrane must be removed. The top of the round and the back and middle of the rump contain the most and the best-flavored juice. It costs more per pound than some other pieces; but as it yields nearly double the amount of juice, it is really cheaper. The tenderloin is often recommended for sick persons. It should never be used for beef tea, as it contains very little juice and lacks flavor. When the tender fibre of the meat is desired, it may be broiled, and served with the juice from some tougher steak.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Broiling</emph> is the quickest, and sometimes the most palatable, way of preparing both essence and tea in an emergency.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Drawing</emph> and <emph rend="italic">heating</emph> the meat and juice is best where a little nourishment is to be given often, and where all the elements of the meat are needed. Soaking in cold water, then straining, and heating the juice only, is the most economical way, as more than twice the usual amount of juice may be obtained by adding more water when the meat has not been heated.</p><p>The albuminous juices of meat coagulate at 160&#176;; if the tea be allowed to boil, they become hard, and settle almost immediately when served. Many make the mistake of straining the tea, or leaving the sediment untouched. If

the tea be heated just enough to make it palatable, it will hold the juices in solution, not separated, and will be thick, and of the color of chocolate, and much more palatable and nutritious than when boiled.</p>

<p>When the crisis of disease is past, the system needs gradual but complete nutrition, and the appetite is clamorous, fickle, or perhaps altogether wanting. Then is the time most critical for the patient, and most trying to the tact, skill, and patience of the nurse. Many a person has been carried safely through a long and distressing illness, only to succumb at last to injudicious feeding, because of the nurse's ignorance or his own indiscretion. When solid food can be safely given, the patient may take it in any of the forms given in the preceding rules.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">Children</emph> and <emph rend="italic">growing persons</emph> need the most nutritious food, and plenty of it at regular intervals; but nothing stimulating nor exciting. They should be given, and compelled to take, sufficient time for eating; and should be taught to masticate everything slowly and thoroughly. They should eat milk; whole-wheat and cornmeal bread; oatmeal, farina, and hominy mush; plenty of ripe fruit raw, and stewed fruit sweetened; beef, mutton, venison, and poultry, either roasted, broiled, or boiled; baked potatoes, and asparagus; green peas, beans, and corn, if every hull be first broken or cut; eggs, omelets, and custards; plain sponge cake; ice-cream, if not too hard and cold, and eaten slowly; simple fruit and bread puddings; fruit, tapioca, and farina; plain gingerbread and molasses cookies; whole-wheat cookies and wafers. Children should avoid hot bread and griddle-cakes; fried meats or cakes or doughnuts; highly seasoned food; rich gravies; rich pastry and cake; pickles, preserves, all stimulants such as tea or coffee; raisins, unless cooked three hours and stoned; sago, arrowroot, and other purely starchy foods, except when combined with milk, eggs, or fruit, and eaten with sugar and cream; and especially veal and pork. Veal is an immature meat, lacking in nourishment; and of the free use of pork, apart from the question of the trichin&#230;, a majority of physicians believe that it is largely responsible for the forms of
 
<pb n="430" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=450"/>

scrofulous disease that have so undermined the health of civilized nations.</p><p>What are termed the "fancies" of delicate persons, especially children, are often natural instincts, pointing out what is beneficial to the system, or the reverse. All children have a fondness for sugar, which should be gratified in moderation rather than repressed. Their desire for it is natural, else it would not have been placed in the milk which forms their only nourishment in infancy. But candy, rich preserves, and cake are not the best form of sweets for children. Pure block sugar or maple sugar is better than any form of candy. It should never be allowed between meals, but may be given occasionally as a part of the dessert. The habit of munching candy between meals destroys the appetite, disturbs the digestion, and is the cause of much illness among children. Children troubled with worms should avoid sugar, preserves, and green vegetables.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Milk</emph> should enter largely into the diet of children. It contains caseine, or flesh-forming material; cream and sugar, which are heat producers; mineral salts, for the bony structure; and water, as a solvent for all the other materials necessary in nutrition. It should be used with discretion, however; not drunk immoderately, but taken slowly as food after the pattern given by nature. Milk as taken is a fluid; but as soon as it meets the acid of the gastric juice, it is changed to a soft, curdy, cheese-like substance, and then must be digested, and the stomach is overtasked if too much be taken at once. A large glass of milk swallowed suddenly will form in the stomach a lump of dense, cheesy curd, which may even prove fatal to a weak stomach. Under the action of the stomach this cheesy mass will turn over and over like a heavy weight; and as the gastric juice can only attack its surface, it digests very slowly. But this same milk, taken slowly, or with dry toast, light rolls, or soft dry porridge, forms a porous lump through which the gastric juice can easily pass, and which breaks up every time the stomach turns it over. Milk should be slightly

salted, and <emph rend="italic">eaten</emph> with bread stuffs or sipped by the spoonful.</p><p>Cow's milk produces less heat than human milk; a child would grow thin upon it unless a little sugar were added. Wheat flour has such an excess of heat-producing material as would fatten a child unduly, and should have cow's milk added to it to reduce its fattening power.</p></section>

When beaten with cold milk, they are more quickly absorbed. If cooked, they should be either very soft, or hard enough to be easily crumbled to a powder, as in any intermediate stage the albumen is tough instead of brittle, and being tough is insoluble by the gastric juice; these insoluble portions are often delayed in the stomach or intestines till they putrefy, and the sulphuretted hydrogen and ammonia evolved become poisonous to the intestinal canal.</p>

Strong <emph rend="italic">Bouillon</emph> is adapted to those suffering from hemorrhoids or any disease of the rectum, as there is no solid waste.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Dyspeptics</emph> should avoid anything which <emph rend="italic">they</emph> (not others) cannot digest. There are so many causes for and forms of dyspepsia, that it is impossible to prescribe one and the same diet for all. Nothing is more disagreeable or useless than to be cautioned against eating this or that, because your neighbor "So-and-so" cannot eat such things. If we would all study the nature and digestion of food, and remember that air and exercise are as essential as food in promoting good health, we could easily decide upon the diet best suited to our individual needs.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">diabetic</emph> should abstain from sugar and anything which is converted into sugar in digestion, such as all starchy foods,--fine wheat flour, rice, macaroni, tapioca, liver, potatoes, beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips, peas, beans, very old cheese, sweet omelets, custards, jellies, starchy nuts, sweet sauces, wine, and liquors. He may eat oysters, all kinds of fish, meat, poultry, and game, soups without any starchy thickening, lettuce, cucumbers, watercresses, dandelions, young onions, cold slaw, olives, cauliflower, spinach, cabbage, string beans, ripe fruit of all kinds without sugar, cream, butter, milk sparingly, gluten, flour, oily nuts freely salted, eggs, coffee, and cocoa.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">corpulent</emph> should abstain from fat as well as sugar and starch. A diet of whole-wheat, milk, vegetables, fruits, and lean meat will produce only a normal amount of fatness; while an excess of sweets, acids, spices, and shortening keeps the system in an unhealthful condition.</p><p>Those who can digest fine flour, pastry, sugar, and fats become loaded with fat, but are neither strong nor vigorous. Thin people with weak digestion should also avoid such food; for thin people are often kept thin by the same food which makes others fat. If they cannot digest the starch,

"Men dig their graves with their teeth; not only by drinking whiskey and using tobacco, but by eating food loaded down with inflammatory materials."</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">bilious</emph> and <emph rend="italic">gouty</emph> should eat sparingly of brown meats, cheese, eggs, beans, peas, or food which is rich in albuminoids. A certain amount of albuminoid or nitrogenized food is requisite for tissue growth and repair; more being required for growing persons and the convalescent than for healthy adults. Most Americans are inclined to eat more albuminoid food than is required. It gives a sensation of energy, of being equal to work, which is very pleasant. But when we have "too much of a good thing," more than is needed for repair of tissue, this surplus of albuminous material is imperfectly oxidized, the blood is laden with waste, and biliousness or gout is the result. Fish gives less albuminoid waste than meat.</p><p>People who are inclined to <emph rend="italic">constipation</emph> should eat whole-wheat, rye, and corn bread and mushes, ripe fruit, berries, green corn, vegetables, beef, mutton, poultry, milk, cream, and butter; and should avoid fried or greasy food, hot bread, rich cake, veal, pork, or anything which has so much woody fibre or cellulose that it only irritates the digestive canal, such as the outer bran of wheat, coarse oatmeal, etc.</p><p>Those with <emph rend="italic">consumptive tendencies</emph> should eat wholesome, easily digested and assimilated food, with plenty of fat,--not in the indigestible form that it takes when mixed with starch, but as in cream, sweet butter, fat of roast or boiled meat, the fat, but not the lean, of ham and corned beef, oil, salads, corn-meal, oatmeal, etc.</p><p>The diet of people who are well should be governed largely by their age, occupation, and exercise.

If the occupation tax the <emph rend="italic">muscular strength,</emph> use muscle-making food; not wholly meat, as many laboring people are inclined to think, but grains, peas, beans, cabbage, milk, cheese, eggs, whole-wheat bread, and chocolate, with a small amount of beef, mutton, and poultry. <emph rend="italic">Students</emph> and <emph rend="italic">brain-workers</emph> need more of brain-producing and less of muscle-making food. Brain food must contain phosphorus, which is found largely in oysters, eggs, fish, lean meat, wheat, peas, beans, and fruit. Those who are engaged in <emph rend="italic">sedentary occupations,</emph> who take little exercise and live in close, confined rooms, should eat only the most easily digested food.</p><p>People who engage in regular active labor, who take plenty of exercise in the open air, cultivate a cheerful, happy disposition, live temperately in every way, and have naturally strong digestive organs, can eat any kind of wholesome food that has been properly cooked, and have no consciousness of a stomach or any visceral organs; and appetite, unless previously impaired, is their best guide. If the digestive organs be not strong naturally, such a mode of life as the above will tend to make them so, more than any amount of drugs or quack medicines.</p></section>

Take the prepared <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> on the point of a large needle or fine skewer, dip them into the syrup, and then lay them on a dish, which has been lightly buttered or oiled; or string them on a thread, and after dipping in the syrup suspend them by the thread. When oranges are used, divide them into eighths, and wipe all moisture. Cherries should be stoned. English walnuts are especially nice prepared in this way.</p></recipe>

<hd align="center" size="larger">THE DINING-ROOM.</hd>
<p>THE subjects of "The Arrangement of the Table," "Dinner-Giving," and "Bills of Fare" have been fully treated in other cook books, and it would be difficult to add to what has already been said. Hints on garnishing, carving, and appropriate combinations of dishes have been given in connection with many of these receipts; and want of space forbids anything more than some general rules.</p><p>Above all things, attempt nothing in style or expense beyond what you can well afford. There is no more paltry ambition, nothing that contains more certainly the seeds of unhappiness and disaster, than such a desire for "empty show," which all sensible people must despise.</p><p>Let your breakfasts be of wholesome and substantial food. The system needs nourishment in the morning after the long, unbroken fast of the night. The practice of taking only a cup of tea or coffee with hot biscuit, and possibly pie or doughnuts, gives a very poor foundation for the morning's labor, which is and should be the hard labor of the day. Milk, coffee, or chocolate, mushes, fruits, potatoes or bread, meat, fish, or eggs, in some of their simple and digestible combinations should form the basis of the breakfast. The morning meal should be taken as soon as possible after rising. Any prolonged bodily exertion or exposure to the early morning air, before the stomach is fortified by food, is now condemned by the majority of physicians.</p><p>The midday and evening meal may vary with the occupations and habits of the family; but a regular hour for eating should be observed, whether the more substantial meal come at noon or night; and if at night sufficient time should be allowed for digestion to be completed before

sleeping. A supper of cold bread and cake or pie is neither appetizing nor satisfying for those who have been hard at work through the day. "Something warm or hearty, something for a relish," every man craves for supper. Toast, brewis, warm tea-cakes, cocoa, oatmeal, warmed-over potatoes, cold meat, made dishes, eggs, oysters, etc., are far better than the common supper of sweets.</p><p>Every one may have clean, if not fine, table linen. An under covering of cotton flannel or felt made to fit the table is desirable, as it prevents noise, and a linen cloth may be laid over it more smoothly than over the bare table. Thin tablecloths remain fresh longer if stiffened slightly with very thin starch, but heavy damask requires no stiffening. Keep the cloths in a drawer large enough to hold them without much folding. Avoid making many folds in ironing, and in handling them fold always in the creases. In laying the cloth, place the centre of it in the centre of the table, and have the folds straight with the edges of the table. Crease the cloth round the edge of the table, that it may drape smoothly.</p><p>Lay a plate, right side up, for each person. If the table be long, place one plate at each end, and those at the sides opposite each other. Place the napkin at the left of the plate, and at dinner place a piece of bread between the folds of the napkin. Place the knives, <implement>butter plate,</implement> and <implement>tumbler</implement> at the right of each plate, the forks at the left, and the soup and <implement>dessert spoons</implement> in front, the handles toward the right hand,--the number of each depending upon the number of courses. The fruit dish or flowers should occupy the centre of the table; the salt and pepper, butter, jelly, pickles, etc., at the corners. Place the various dishes on the table in regular order, straight with the table, or, if at an angle, let there be some uniformity, never helter-skelter. The cups, plates, and dishes for hot food should be heated in hot water or in a <implement>warming-oven.</implement> Use a spoon to place ice in delicate glasses or pitchers; or put in the water first, and then the ice, to avoid breaking.</p>
 
<pb n="441" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=461"/>

<p>Do not let the table become disordered during the meal. The dishes, plates, etc., should be removed noiselessly, one by one; and never piled one upon another, after the hasty fashion of second-class hotels.</p><p>If the serving be done by the host and hostess, it is more convenient for them to sit at the sides of the table; the host serving the substantial dishes, and the hostess the tea or coffee, vegetables or entr&#233;es, puddings, and the dessert. Where there are servants to do the waiting, the host and hostess may sit at the ends of the table, as there they can command a better view of their guests, and see that they are properly served. The hostess should serve the soup, salad, dessert, and coffee; the host, the fish and meat; and the servants, the vegetables and entr&#233;es.</p><p>At a dinner served <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> the fruit and flowers only are placed upon the table, the several courses being served from the side.</p><p>Many volumes have been written upon table etiquette. Some of the suggestions they contain are practical; others useless. What is considered proper at one place or time is not approved under other circumstances; and those desirous of observing the usages of good society are often sorely perplexed to keep pace with the variations of fashion. But if, instead of following mere arbitrary rules from the low standpoint of "style," we would take for our guidance the best definition of true politeness as given by Dr. Watts,--"Love manifested in an easy and graceful manner,"--we need never be at a loss as to "what to do and what not to do." A moment's observation will show the strictness of etiquette maintained in the family in which you may be a guest,--for instance, whether the servants are expected to take entire charge of serving everything, or whether the family reserve to themselves something of the happy privilege of courtesy and thought for each other; and you may forget with them, in the mutual interchange of the proper attentions, that freezing formality which sometimes forbids that you should seem to know or care how your neighbor fares. "Think not of
 
<pb n="442" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=462"/>

yourself, but of what will contribute most to another's comfort or convenience," remembering that for the time being utter deference should be paid to the evident arrangement of the house at which you are. This is the safest standard for table etiquette, as well as for good manners everywhere. No selfish person can ever be truly polite. Children should be carefully trained in table manners as soon as they are old enough to come to the table, and accustomed to perfect politeness; then there will be no fear of mishaps, nor special training needed for "company," nor any awkward habits to be overcome in later life</p><p>After a meal brush up any crumbs that may have fallen, lest they be trodden into the carpet. Collect the knives, forks, and spoons by themselves. Put any food that may be used again on small dishes, never on the dishes used in serving. Scrape the dishes, empty and rinse the cups, and pack neatly near where they are to be washed. Brush the crumbs from the cloth, instead of shaking it, then fold and put it away carefully.</p><p>Never pile nice china or any other dishes in the dishpan. Begin with a pan half filled with hot soapy water. Keep the soap in a shaker made for that purpose, or in a tin cup; make a strong lather in the cup, and use as needed. Never leave the soap in the dishpan to waste and stick to the dishes. Wash glasses first. Slip them in sideways, so that the hot water will touch outside and inside at once, and then there will be no danger of breaking from unequal expansion. Wash one at a time, and wipe instantly without draining or rinsing. Wash the silver and wipe at once, as it keeps bright longer if wiped out of hot soapy water. Keep a cake of silver soap at hand, and rub each piece of silver as soon as discolored. Then wash the china, beginning with the cups, saucers, pitchers, and least greasy dishes, and changing the water as soon as cool or greasy. Place these dishes in the rinsing-pan with the cups inside up and plates resting on the edges, that they may be scalded inside as well as outside, and drain quickly. Scald and wipe immediately.</p>
 
<pb n="443" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=463"/>

<p>"Dave's" method of washing dishes, though not in general use, has been proved satisfactory. Place a pan of cold water between the washing and rinsing pans. After washing and wiping the glasses and silver, add more hot water, and wash the china first in the hot suds, then dip each dish instantly into the cold water, and stand it on the edge to drain in the rinsing-pan. The cold water rinses off the hot suds, and the sudden change of temperature dries the dishes almost instantly; and they require little or no wiping. They will be neither "sticky nor streaky."</p><p>Where there is only one woman for "cook, waitress, hostess, and kitchen girl," it is well, after the table is cleared and the dishes neatly packed, to wash first the kitchen dishes, and pots and kettles; then with clean water and towels wash and wipe the table dishes. The hands will be left in much better condition than when the pots and kettles are washed last.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Care of Kitchen Utensils.</hd>
<p>A complete list of kitchen utensils is not given in this work, as the variety and number needed will be largely determined by circumstances. There are several utensils, which are not perhaps in general use, which lessen the labor of cooking, and add much to the attractiveness of food prepared by their aid.</p><p>There is nothing that makes so much difference between ordinary and delicate cooking as a <emph rend="italic">set of strainers.</emph> There should be one of <emph rend="italic">very fine wire</emph> for sifting soda, spices, etc., and for straining custards and jellies; others with meshes from <emph rend="italic">one sixteenth</emph> to <emph rend="italic">one eighth</emph> of <emph rend="italic">an inch</emph> in diameter; also a <implement rend="italic">squash strainer</implement> and a <implement rend="italic">colander.</implement> <implement rend="italic">Extension wire strainers</implement> are very convenient. Keep also a supply of <implement rend="italic">strainer cloths,</implement> made from <emph rend="italic">coarse crash</emph> or <implement rend="italic">cheese cloth,</implement> and <emph rend="italic">fine napkin linen.</emph></p><p>A set of <emph rend="italic">oval tin moulds,</emph> a <implement rend="italic">melon mould,</implement> and one or two <emph rend="italic">fancy moulds</emph> are convenient for entr&#233;es, puddings, and jellies.</p>
 
<pb n="444" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=464"/>

<p>Other useful articles are <implement rend="italic">Dover egg-beaters,</implement> large and small; ordinary small <emph rend="italic">wooden spoons</emph> and the larger perforated ones; a <implement rend="italic">whip churn;</implement> <implement rend="italic">granite saucepans</implement> and <implement rend="italic">stewpans,</implement> holding from half a pint to six quarts; <implement rend="italic">double boilers;</implement> a <emph rend="italic">wire basket</emph> for frying; a <implement rend="italic">potato slicer;</implement> a <implement rend="italic">fine wire broiler</implement> for toast, and two coarser ones for steak and fish; a set of <emph rend="italic">pastry bags</emph> and <implement rend="italic">frosting tubes;</implement> <implement rend="italic">>fancy vegetable cutters;</implement> a <emph rend="italic">glass rolling-pin;</emph> and, above all, a small sharp-pointed <emph rend="italic">knife,</emph> made from the best steel, for paring potatoes, turnips, etc., and a set of <emph rend="italic">tin measuring-cups</emph> holding half a pint, and divided into quarters and thirds.</p><p>It is a mistake to have many large, unwieldy dishes. Small saucepans and small bowls are more convenient, and granite or <implement>agate ware</implement> is much lighter to handle and more easily kept clean than ironware. Buckets are convenient for keeping sugar and small quantities of flour. Glass jars or wide-mouthed bottles are best for nearly all groceries, such as rice, tapioca, meal, raisins, etc. They are easily cleansed, and the contents are plainly seen. They may be kept air-tight, or, if that be unnecessary, old jars not suitable for canning may be utilized.</p><p>A refrigerator should be examined daily and kept thoroughly clean. If a suitable brush cannot be had, a long stiff wire with a bit of cloth on the end should be used to clean the drain pipe. Pour boiling washing-soda water through it every other day, and do not forget to wash off the slime that adheres to the water pan. Fish, onions, cheese, any strong vegetables, lemons, or meat not perfectly sweet, should not be kept in the same <implement>ice-box</implement> with milk or butter.</p><p>Do not become wedded to the idea that dishes can only be washed in a sink. If your pantry or cookroom be some distance from your sink, and have a broad shelf or table in it, take your dishpan to the pantry, wash and wipe your dishes there, and in this way save a few of the unnecessary steps which soon amount to miles with many weary housekeepers.</p>

in an iron sink. The iron<pb n="445" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=465"/>

will leave a black mark on the board, which it is difficult to remove. Wash the board on the table where you have used it; use cold water, and scrub occasionally with sand soap. In scraping dough from the board, scrape with the grain of the wood, and hold the knife in a slanting direction, to prevent roughening the surface of the board. Wash, and wipe dry, and never let dough accumulate in the cracks. Have one board for bread and pastry, and keep it smooth. Use a smaller board for rolling crumbs and pounding and cleaning meat and fish.</p></formula>

<p>All dishes should be scraped before washing. A small <implement>wooden knife</implement> is best for this purpose.

should never be placed in the dish water. Many err in thinking it is only the handles which should not be wet.

Keep the knives out of the water, but wash thoroughly with the dishcloth, rub them with mineral soap or brick dust, and wipe them dry. Keep them bright, and sharpen often on a sandstone.

<formula class="household"><p>Kitchen mineral soap or pumice stone may be used freely on all dishes.

in cold water, with plenty of soap, and rinse thoroughly in cold water, every time they are used. If left to dry without washing, they will be sticky to handle and have a disagreeable odor. If the dishes be well washed, rinsed, and drained, the dish towels will require no rubbing. It is easier to take care of three or four which have never been left to become grimy than to wash one after it is stained and saturated with grease. Towels used in this way may be kept sweet and clean without boiling or drying in the sun. This method has been proved by years of trial.</p></formula>

<p>With a little care in observing these hints, and always using clean, hot soapy water (and not a liquid fit only for the swill cart), changing it as soon as greasy, dish-washing would be robbed of half its terrors. And after the work is done, if the hands be carefully washed with <emph rend="italic">Castile</emph> soap, not with strong washing-soap, and wiped dry, no unpleasant effect upon the skin will be felt.

<p>A large apron made like a child's tire, high in the neck, with long sleeves, and buttoned in the back, is the best pattern for a work apron.

<hd align="center" size="larger">FOOD:<lb/>

ITS USES, CLASSIFICATION, AND PROPORTION.</hd>
<p>WEBSTER defines food as "anything that supports and nourishes life."</p><p>The kingdom of nature is divided into <emph rend="italic">organic</emph> and <emph rend="italic">inorganic</emph> bodies. Organic bodies have life; inorganic bodies are without life. Organic bodies are composed of several reciprocal parts, each of which is necessary to, and dependent upon, all the other parts. Organic bodies, therefore, include <emph rend="italic">plants</emph> and <emph rend="italic">animals,</emph> and inorganic bodies include <emph rend="italic">earths, metals,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">minerals.</emph> Organic bodies spring from some parent or immediate producing agent; they are supported by means of nourishment, and die without it; they increase in size by the addition of new particles of matter to all parts of their substances. Inorganic bodies are formed by some chemical law or union, and grow only by addition to their surfaces.</p><p>Organic and inorganic bodies are continually wasting away or wearing out. Waste takes place in all objects, animate and inanimate. The minutest change in position in any plant, animal, or rock cannot be effected without some loss of substance. It has always been beyond the power of man to make anything that would not wear out. But there is this important distinction between organic and inorganic bodies. Only organic bodies can repair their waste, and add to their substance; they alone have life, or vital force. When anything wears out in a stone or a steam-engine, there is no power in the stone or the engine to replace the lost matter; and when a plant or an animal dies, the power of repairing waste is gone from it forever. Hence it is with <emph rend="italic">animate</emph> bodies, or bodies endowed with <emph rend="italic">life,</emph> that we have to do in considering the subject of food.</p>
 
<pb n="450" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=470"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Life</emph> is that form of energy in creation that results in development from within the object. The energy may be purely physical, as in plants; or it may involve mental and moral considerations, as in animals.</p><p>There are some essential distinctions between the various forms of organic life. Animals grow proportionally in all directions, and, at a certain time of life, attain their average size. Plants grow upwards and downwards from a collet only, and continue to grow through a term of existence. Animals feed upon organic matter, consume oxygen from the air, and throw off carbonic acid; plants feed upon inorganic matter, consume carbonic acid, and restore oxygen to the air.</p><p>Living plants or vegetables are, with few exceptions, fixed to the spot of earth from which they spring, and receive their nourishment from external sources. It is furnished them by the soil, air, light, and heat by which they are surrounded; and they are every moment receiving all that is necessary for their sustenance. If one of these essential conditions be withdrawn, death follows. Living animals have the power of <emph rend="italic">locomotion,</emph> and, being obliged to wander, they are not always directly in contact with their sources of nourishment. They have, therefore, a storehouse in which they lay up at intervals a supply of material. The possession of this stomach, or storehouse, characterizes all animal beings.</p><p>The changes that occur in animal life are more rapid and variable than those in vegetable life. Not being, like vegetables, always in connection with their food, animals need some monitor to warn them when to seek it. This is provided them in the <emph rend="italic">appetite,</emph> or the sensations of <emph rend="italic">hunger</emph> and <emph rend="italic">thirst.</emph> There is also a pleasure in the regulated indulgence of these sensations, which never fails to insure attention to their demands.</p><p>The vegetable kingdom is the original source of all organic matter. All our food is derived directly from the vegetable world, or indirectly through animals which have been nourished on vegetable products. The ox and sheep, which are consumed in the form of beef and mutton, have not fed on flesh, but on grass, hay, oats, and other grains. It is only under exposure to the sun's rays that plants will grow. Hence to its influence we must refer the production of food in the first instance, and therefore the sustenance of all life.</p><p>Life and growth in human beings are dependent upon two conditions,--motion and warmth.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Motion.</emph>--Our bodies are constantly in motion. The heart
 
<pb n="451" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=471"/>

and lungs move with every breath. Every thought causes some change in the brain. Whenever any part of the body loses its power of motion, it dies. All this motion, whether voluntary or involuntary, results in the gradual wasting away of the flesh, blood, and bones of which the body is composed. "We begin to die as soon as we begin to live." If the worn-out materials be not replaced, we die. One great object of food is to supply this waste. The demand for building material is greatest when the body is in a state of activity. Until the human body has attained its complete growth, there should be a constant supply of material for <emph rend="italic">new growth,</emph> as well as for repair. In maturity, or when, from bodily inactivity, there is less waste, a smaller supply will suffice. Food taken at regular intervals supplies means of growth, and repairs the worn-out tissues.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Warmth.</emph>--The temperature of the living human body is about 98&#176;. In hot or cold climates, in summer or winter, though the temperature of the external parts may vary, the internal temperature is the same; and if not maintained within a few degrees of this point, death invariably follows. The source of this animal heat, so independent of outside circumstances, must be from within. To keep up this internal heat or fire, a constant supply of fuel is necessary. This fuel is supplied by our food. To furnish material for growth and repair, and to provide fuel for the warmth of the body, is the twofold object of food.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Animal Combustion.</emph>--The process by which food maintains the motion and warmth of the body is a kind of combustion, and has often been compared to the combustion carried on in the steam-engine (see Youmans's Chemistry). We can have no combustion without oxygen; therefore <emph rend="italic">oxygen</emph> is the first important element of food. The air is our great source of supply of oxygen, and a volume might be written on the necessity for pure air and perfect ventilation. We breathe oxygen from the air into our lungs, and exhale carbonic acid. There must therefore have been some internal union of carbon or hydrogen with oxygen, and such a union always produces heat. The <emph rend="italic">carbon</emph> and <emph rend="italic">hydrogen</emph> are obtained from our food, and are important elements. They are necessary for animal combustion.</p><p>Food is taken in a natural or in a prepared state, and, after undergoing certain processes of digestion and assimilation, becomes a part of our bodies for a time, and then is burned in the body, the process resembling somewhat the burning of wood and coal in our grates. But this union of carbon and oxygen, "instead of taking place in one spot and so rapidly as to be accompanied
 
<pb n="452" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=472"/>

by light, as in the case of the grate fire, takes place in each drop of the blood, and so slowly and continuously as not to be noticed." The force and heat absorbed from the sun by the vegetable in growing, and stored in its starch and sugar, are set free, by the decomposition of the vegetable, into carbonic acid and water again. These are given out, partly as heat, keeping the body temperature at 98&#176;; and partly in other forms,--in that of mechanical motion, etc.</p><p>All the external or internal work of the body is done by the force and energy of the food which is burnt therein. The greater the amount of work to be done, the greater must be the supply of fuel. The fire is constantly burning. "The smoke passes out in exhalation, inhalation is the bellows to furnish more oxygen," and food supplies the fuel. The kidneys are the grates through which the ashes are removed. But if we are "a house on fire," why are we not consumed? Because, lest this internal fire burn too freely, the oxygen of the air is diluted with nitrogen, which is incombustible. The blood, bones, and muscles of the body are composed largely of nitrogen, sixteen per cent of that element being present; and this prevents the complete burning up of the structure. "What the iron is to the stove, the nitrogenous tissues are to the body." But the stove wears out in time, and so our bodies are constantly wasting away; and these nitrogenous elements must be supplied by our food.</p><p>Food, to accomplish its purpose fully, should consist of these four elements: <emph rend="italic">oxygen,</emph> to support combustion,--obtained from the air; <emph rend="italic">carbon</emph> and <emph rend="italic">hydrogen,</emph> to furnish fuel,--obtained from water and carbonaceous food; <emph rend="italic">nitrogen,</emph> to build up and repair the tissues of the body,--obtained from nitrogenous food.</p><p>Food, in the form in which it is eaten, cannot sustain life. It must be converted into a fluid that can pass through very small channels into the blood. Then it must be mixed with the air, and undergo certain changes, before it can replace the worn-out elements of the body. To prepare food so that it can most readily be assimilated, that is, made like our bodies, should be the chief purpose in cooking. To do this, three things are essential: 1st. The food selected should be of the right material, and properly proportioned; 2d. It should be cooked in the most digestible and attractive manner; 3d. It should be adapted to the various circumstances of age, occupation, climate, and state of health.</p><p>Food, to be of the right material, should contain all the elements
 
<pb n="453" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=473"/>

that our bodies contain. It is of primary importance, then, in studying food, to understand first the composition of the human body.</p></section>
<section class1="generalnonfood">
<hd align="center" size="larger">THE COMPOSITION OF THE HUMAN BODY.</hd>
<p>Our bodies are made up of different materials: skin, flesh, blood, bone, etc. These consist of a large number of substances, called compounds; the compounds contain two, three, or four elements, united chemically in definite proportion. Some of these compounds are: <emph rend="italic">water,</emph> which forms more than two thirds of the whole body, and is the common carrier of food into and through the system; <emph rend="italic">fibrine,</emph> which is the chief solid material of flesh, and forms one tenth of the body; <emph rend="italic">fat,</emph> a mixture of three compounds, distributed all through the system; <emph rend="italic">albumen,</emph> and other nitrogenous substances, of which <emph rend="italic">osseine</emph> in bones, <emph rend="italic">keratin</emph> in the hair, nails, and skin, <emph rend="italic">cartilagin</emph> in cartilage, and <emph rend="italic">hemoglobin,</emph> which contains iron and gives the red color to the blood, are the most important. <emph rend="italic">Chloride of sodium,</emph> or common salt, and other mineral salts of <emph rend="italic">potassa, lime,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">magnesia,</emph> are found in all parts of the body. These compounds are made up of two or more separate and distinct elements.</p><p>There are sixteen elements in the human body,--oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, fluorine, silicon, calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, manganese, and copper. Compounds only, not the separate elements, are capable of nourishing the body. Oxygen only exists as an element. Its office is to support combustion.</p><p>Combinations of two or more of these elements are found in the various articles used as food. It is quite important that our food should consist of various materials, containing elements similar to, or capable of being changed into, the elements of our bodies, of which the most important are: <emph rend="italic">water,</emph> to help digestion and assimilation of food, and to help carry away refuse material; <emph rend="italic">salts,</emph> to renew the mineral parts and replenish certain tissues; <emph rend="italic">carbon,</emph> to furnish fuel for warmth; <emph rend="italic">nitrogen,</emph> to build up and repair the whole structure.</p><p>For convenience the elements are classified chemically into <emph rend="italic">Non-Combustibles,</emph> or inorganic compounds, including <emph rend="italic">water</emph> and <emph rend="italic">salts; Combustibles,</emph> or organic compounds, including <emph rend="italic">carbonaceous</emph> and <emph rend="italic">nitrogenous foods.</emph> Some foods contain no carbon, some contain no nitrogen, and some have all the elements in
 
<pb n="454" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=474"/>

various proportions. Food has been classified into gaseous, or air; liquid, or water; and solid, including animal and vegetable foods. But the division into carbonaceous, or heat-producing, and nitrogenous, or flesh-forming foods, answers every purpose.</p></section>
<section class1="generalnonfood">
<hd align="center" size="larger">NON-COMBUSTIBLE COMPOUNDS.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Water and Salts.</hd>
<p>Water forms more than two thirds of the whole body. It is especially abundant in the blood and secretions. It gives them the necessary fluidity, and enables them to dissolve the important materials they contain. It is contained in all kinds of solid food, as well as in the liquids drunk as beverages. It is most abundant in fruits and vegetables. Every pound of perfectly dry food should be accompanied with four pounds of water.</p><p>Pure water is composed of oxygen and hydrogen, one ninth hydrogen and eight ninths oxygen by weight. The usual test for pure drinking water is that it be "free from color, smell, or taste, be soft, bright, and aerated, and free from all deposit." But it is very seldom found in that condition, as its power of dissolving other substances is so great that it nearly always holds animal, vegetable, or mineral matters in solution, obtained from the earth through which it flows. It also absorbs gases and odors from the air. The animal and vegetable substances found in it render it impure. But the mineral matters, unless in excess, are not objectionable.</p><p>When water contains more than a few grains to the gallon of carbonate of lime, it is termed hard water. When water is hard or impure, it should be boiled before being used for drinking, as this destroys the vegetable and animal impurities.</p><p>Water evaporates at all temperatures, boils at 212&#176;, and freezes at 32&#176; Fahrenheit. In freezing, the substances dissolved in water are expelled. Water, as it approaches the freezing-point, expands, and often bursts the vessels in which it is contained. In ponds or rivers it expands, becomes lighter, freezes, and floats on the surface in the form of ice.</p><p>Water is perfectly neutral. It combines with acids and with bases. It becomes sweet, sour, salt, astringent, bitter, or poisonous, according to the nature of the bodies it holds in solution.</p>
 
<pb n="455" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=475"/>

<p><emph rend="italic">Salts and other Mineral Matters.</emph>--The chief purpose of mineral ingredients is to replenish certain tissues, and aid in the transferrence and absorption of the combustible nutrients, as a scaffolding aids in the construction of a building.</p><p>Chloride of sodium, or common salt, is essential to the life of the higher animals. It exists in all parts of the body. It is more abundant in the blood than any other inorganic ingredient except water; but it is an active poisonous irritant if taken in excess, causing diseases of the mucous membranes, as in catarrh, and stiffening of the muscles, as in rheumatism. We take it as a natural ingredient in many kinds of food, and as a condiment to increase the relish of many others.</p><p>The desire for salt is instinctive. There are people who do not use salt in food, but it is probable that they obtain sufficient sodium and chlorine in the brackish water they drink; or it may be, their habits of life render less salt necessary.</p><p>Salt must be added plentifully to all vegetable food. The bad effects of a salt-meat diet can be counteracted by the use of lemon juice and fresh green vegetables, which are rich in potash salts.</p><p>Salt taken with our food supplies two substances. Its chlorine supplies the hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, that helps digest our food; and soda, which is an element of the bile,--a fluid which must be added to the dissolved or softened food before the nourishment can be extracted from it. People would very soon become ill if deprived of salt. A person requires from one fourth to half an ounce of salt daily. The attractive flavor which is developed by cooking and adding salt to our food excites the secretion of saliva and gastric juice, and therefore helps digestion. The Dutch used to condemn criminals to a diet of unsalted food. They suffered great physical torture, which soon ended in death.</p><p>Salt is one of the most abundant of all minerals. It is obtained from springs by evaporation, and from natural mines. It is readily soluble in hot or cold water. It is used for packing and preserving meats, as it prevents putrefaction by absorbing water from the flesh.</p><p>The other mineral ingredients needed in the system are combinations of <emph rend="italic">lime, soda, potash, magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">iron.</emph> Phosphorus, lime, and magnesia are found in meat, fish, the cereals, and potatoes. Potash is found in meat, fish, milk, vegetables, and the dry seeds and fleshy parts of fruits; iron, in flesh, vegetables, and nearly all food, in very minute quantities.
 
<pb n="456" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=476"/>

Sulphur is in fibrine, albumen, and caseine. There is sufficient saline matter, except common salt, in all the ordinary food we eat and the water we drink.</p><p>These mineral matters become rearranged and combined before becoming part of the body, but they do not undergo any chemical change or decomposition. They are absorbed with the food, and form for a time part of the animal tissues, after which they are discharged with the secretions, and replaced by a fresh supply. They are absolutely indispensable to the nourishment of the body.</p></section>
<section>
<hd align="center" size="larger">COMBUSTIBLE COMPOUNDS.</hd>
<subsection class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">CARBONACEOUS FOODS.</hd>
<p>The first division of combustible compounds is called <emph rend="italic">carbonaceous</emph> because they all contain carbon; or <emph rend="italic">heat-producing,</emph> because by their burning they generate heat. They consist of starch, sugar, fats and oils, gum, and the softer fibres of plants. They are found in vegetables, cereals, fruits, milk, eggs, and the fat of meat.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Starch.</hd>
<p>Starch is one of the most important of vegetable foods; it is found in grains, seeds, and roots, and in the pith and bark of plants. When pure, it is a snow-white, glistening powder. It consists of exceedingly minute grains, varying in size and shape in the different kinds of starch. These grains are covered with an outer skin which is insoluble and unchanged by cold water; but in boiling, this membrane bursts and the interior of each grain dissolves in the water, forming a thick, gummy solution. When cool, it stiffens into a kind of pasty mass.</p><p>Starchy food is very unwholesome unless properly cooked. It must be mixed with a sufficient amount of liquid, and subjected to a great degree of heat, that the grains may swell and burst. This liquid is sometimes supplied by the boiling water in which certain starchy foods are cooked; and sometimes by fat which melts with the heat, as in pastry, or by boiling fat, as in anything fried. When flour or starchy food is mixed with fat, it should be finely and evenly mixed, that the fat may penetrate
 
<pb n="457" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=477"/>

every part of the flour, or else it will cake, and all the grains will not burst. Anything that helps to make pastry lighter and the fat more evenly distributed, causes the starch grains to burst equally, and makes such food more wholesome.</p><p>Vegetables should be put into boiling water to burst the starch cells, and set free the confined air, of which there is a great deal in many kinds. They should be taken up as soon as they are soft, as they absorb water after the grains are fully burst.</p><p>Starch in its uncooked, insoluble state is not digested by the human stomach. Seeds and fruits which consist of starch, especially if it be combined with oil, as in many nuts, if eaten uncooked, are very difficult to digest.</p><p>All starchy articles of food should be masticated thoroughly, and mixed with the saliva. It is more necessary to chew bread and potatoes well than meat. Starch is changed by various means into sugar. If an acid be added to it in a watery solution, and boiled, it becomes clear and transparent, and after a time all the starch disappears, and sugar takes its place. The same change is caused by the saliva, and during digestion the starch is all changed into sugar, so that none of it is found in the fluids and secretions of the body. This is easily seen by chewing pure starch; after a while it will become sweet.</p><p>Starch contains no albuminous substances, and therefore cannot supply any of the materials of which our bodies are formed. But it is the source of the warmth of our bodies, and the strength we exert. Taken alone, it would be useless as an article of food. It must have the addition of albuminoid and fatty substances, like milk or meat.</p><p>Starch is prepared by grinding some vegetable matter that contains it in abundance, and mixing it with cold water. The water is strained and allowed to stand; the starch settles at the bottom, and is then dried and powdered. <emph rend="italic">Cornstarch</emph> is obtained from Indian corn, by a chemical process. The glutinous, oily elements are freed from the seed by alkaline solutions, and the starchy parts are ground and dried. <emph rend="italic">Sago</emph> is starch from the pith of a species of palm-tree. <emph rend="italic">Tapioca</emph> is from the root of a species of the cassava plant of South America. It is a coarsely granulated substance. <emph rend="italic">Cassava,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">mandioc,</emph> is a more finely granulated form of the same root. <emph rend="italic">Arrowroot</emph> is from the rhizoma, or rootstalk, of a West Indian plant. The natives use the roots of a species of the plant in extracting the poison of arrows; hence the name.</p>
 
<pb n="458" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=478"/>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sugar.</hd>
<p>Sugar is composed of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. There are three kinds,--cane sugar, or sucrose; grape sugar, or glucose; milk sugar, or lactose.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Cane sugar</emph> as an article of food closely resembles starch, but it is soluble and therefore more easily digested. It is readily distinguished by its sweet taste. It is found in many animal juices and also in fruits, but exists mainly in vegetable juices which have little or no acid in their sap, like sugar cane, rock maple, and beet-root. In its natural state it is dissolved in the vegetable fluids, mingled with many other substances. It is obtained by crushing the raw material; the fluids thus obtained are heated with a solution of lime, which causes the impurities to separate and rise in scum. These are removed, and the purified juice boiled down until it solidifies as a brownish deposit. This brown sugar is again dissolved, boiled, and filtered through charcoal, evaporated, and crystallized. Molasses is the drainage of the raw sugar. Brown sugar is the first product. Granulated sugar is brown sugar refined and re-crystallized. All brown and moist sugars are inferior in quality; they contain water and mineral matter, and are sometimes infested by a minute insect. Loaf sugar is the purest.</p><p>Sucrose, or cane sugar, is changed, by the acids of the gastric juice and the nitrogenous matter of the food, into grape sugar, or glucose. One of the most remarkable properties of sugar is that it can be decomposed and converted into other substances by fermentation. In its chemical relations sugar ranks with acids, and combines with bases, as in sugar of lead. It melts at 320&#176;, and by cooling forms a transparent amber-colored solid known as barley sugar. If heated to 420&#176;, it forms a brown mass, called caramel. Sugar has great preservative powers, and is used in preserving fruits, hams, bacon, etc.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Glucose,</emph> or grape sugar, is abundantly distributed throughout the vegetable kingdom. It is found in honey, figs, grapes, and other fruits which have acid juices. It is less sweet than cane sugar, and is immediately absorbed into the circulation when taken into the stomach. It is less soluble and less easily crystallized than sucrose.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Lactose,</emph> or milk sugar, is obtained only from the milk of mammalia. It has the composition of cane sugar, and is converted into grape sugar when taken as food.</p>
 
<pb n="459" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=479"/>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fats.</hd>
<p>Fats, or oleaginous substances, are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,--the two former elements preponderating,--and, having a very strong affinity for oxygen, are highly combustible.</p><p>Fats are solid; oils are liquid. Fats may be changed to oil by a slight accession of heat, and are obtained from both animal and vegetable tissues,--suet and dripping, from beef fat; lard, from the fat of pigs; butter, from the cream of milk; olive oil, from the fleshy pulp of the fruit of the olive tree. Oil is also found in nuts, seeds, cereals, and fruits. Croton oil, used for medicinal purposes, is from a plant, a native of India; cod liver oil, from the liver of cod fish; castor oil, from the seeds of the castor-oil plant.</p><p>Fats and oils contain three different oleaginous substances, known as stearine, margarine, and oleine. <emph rend="italic">Oleine</emph> is that portion of oil that causes its fluidity. It is more abundant in oils than fats, and in the fat of swine than in the harder fat of sheep or beef. Lard is better than mutton fat or suet for frying, because, having more oleine, it can be converted into a liquid sooner. <emph rend="italic">Margarine</emph> is harder than oleine. It exists in human fat, in butter, and olive oil. <emph rend="italic">Stearine</emph> is the most solid substance of the three, and is most abundant in tallow and suet.</p><p>The peculiar odor some fats and oils possess is from the presence of an acid. In butter it is butyric acid. Glycerine is the base common to all the fats. In stearine, the hardest fat, it unites with stearic acid; in margarine, a less solid form, with margaric acid; in oleine, or oil, with oleic acid.</p><p>"Fat forms the chief material of adipose tissue. It serves to fill spaces and give rotundity and beauty to the form, to equalize external pressure, to diminish the friction of the parts, to give suppleness to the tissues, and, being a non-conductor of heat, to keep the body warm. An undue accumulation of fat is a species of disease."</p><p>Oils and fats will not mix with water; but if an alkaline substance, like potash or soda, be added, the oil becomes separated into fine particles, and is held suspended in the watery fluid. This is called an emulsion, and this is what takes place in intestinal digestion. The gastric juice, being acid, does not digest fat, but only separates it from these substances, that it may digest the albuminous portions with which it is mingled. But
 
<pb n="460" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=480"/>

the pancreatic fluid, being alkaline, resolves the fat into an emulsion. This completes the digestion, then the fats are absorbed and received into the general circulation. Having a strong affinity for oxygen, these fatty particles in the venous blood, when they come in contact with the oxygen of the air, burn, and heat is evolved. The power of fat in maintaining heat and activity is two and a half times that of starch.</p><p>Oils which are used as food are <emph rend="italic">fixed</emph> oils. <emph rend="italic">Volatile</emph> oils are found in many condiments and perfumes. Volatile oils can be distilled, or changed to vapor, and recondensed into their original form; they leave no permanent stain on paper. Fixed or greasy oils cannot be distilled; before changing to vapor they recombine into new compounds.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Gum, Mucilage, Pectose, and Cellulose.</hd>
<p>These are combustible compounds, but are neither starchy, saccharine, nor oily. Gum is found in apple and plum trees. Gum arabic is from a species of acacia, and is soluble. Mucilage is found in onions, quinces, and flaxseed. It forms a jelly with water, but does not dissolve like gum arabic. Pectose is found in many roots, like the turnip; also in the pear and peach. When boiled with water it changes to a vegetable jelly, called pectine. Currants, pears, peaches, plums, contain pectine, and this is what gives firmness to the preserves made from them. Cellulose is the woody fibre of stalks of grain, the membrane which envelops the grains, husks, and skin of seeds, rinds, cores, and stones of fruits. It is the main and almost the sole constituent of linen, and of the paper which is made from linen.</p></subsection>
<subsection class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">NITROGENOUS FOODS.</hd>
<p>The second division of the Combustible Compounds is called <emph rend="italic">nitrogenous,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">flesh-forming foods.</emph> Nitrogen is the flesh-forming element common to all foods. It enters largely into the composition of the body, forming sixteen per cent of the animal tissue. A liberal supply is necessary to form and repair tissue. Although the atmosphere is four fifths nitrogen, we get no supply from that source. It must be supplied in a state of combination, not as an element, from such compounds as have been produced under the influence of life. We require organic nitrogenous matter, and not pure nitrogen. This is sometimes derived from vegetable sources, but is most
 
<pb n="461" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=481"/>

abundant in animal substances. Animal food is richer and more nutritious than vegetable food; but the latter, if taken in large quantities, yields the same amount of flesh-forming material. Nitrogenous substances in plants and animals are identical in composition; and, from whichever source they are taken, the most important consideration is, to digest them and make them into blood.</p><p>Nitrogen is an essential part of some of our most powerful medicines, like quinine and morphine, and of our most dangerous poisons, such as strychnine and prussic acid.</p><p>Nitrogenous foods are also called <emph rend="italic">albuminous,</emph> because albumen is their common element, though it is called by different names in different things. <emph rend="italic">Albumen</emph> is from <emph rend="italic">albus,</emph> meaning white. The principal varieties of albuminous food are lean meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, peas, beans, oatmeal, flour, rye, and corn. These are treated more fully in other parts of the book, in chapters on Bread, Meats, Fish, Eggs, Milk, and Vegetables.</p><p>The albuminous portion of meat is the juice, or albumen, and the fibre, or fibrine. In eggs it is the white. In milk it is the caseine, or the curdy part that separates when milk has soured. In peas and beans it is called vegetable caseine. In flour it is gluten,--the sticky, glutinous substance which is left after squeezing or washing out the starch.</p><p>Albumen exists in two states,--one soluble in water and one insoluble. The soluble may be changed to insoluble by heating to 120&#176;, or by adding nitric acid. It is the most easily digested of all flesh-forming foods.</p><p>Albuminous substances have the property of <emph rend="italic">coagulation;</emph> but all albuminoids do not coagulate in the same way. The albumen of eggs and the juices of meat coagulate by heating to the boiling-point. The fibrine of the blood coagulates when exposed to the air. Milk coagulates by the addition of an acid.</p><p>Albuminous substances also have the property of <emph rend="italic">fermentation.</emph> This occurs principally in substances which are rich in sugar, starch, and gluten, like flour, milk, etc. The fermentation in flour and milk is explained in the chapter on Bread-Making.</p><p>Fermentation will not take place without air or moisture, and a moderate degree of heat. Therefore, if albuminous substances be excluded from air and moisture, and kept very hot or very cold, they will not ferment. Fermentation is a change in the elements of a body composed of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. Sugar is composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in equal parts; when sugar ferments, it decomposes and then reunites in
 
<pb n="462" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=482"/>

different proportions, forming different compounds,--alcohol, carbonic acid, and water.</p><p>Albuminous substances are the only substances which putrefy. <emph rend="italic">Putrefaction</emph> resembles fermentation, and is due to the presence, in large proportion, of the fickle element, nitrogen, and also to the large number of elements combined in all albuminous substances. Complicated machinery is always more easily deranged than simple; and in all chemical combinations, the more complex they are, the more unstable. Nitrogen has a very weak affinity for other elements, and forms very unstable compounds. All substances rich in nitrogen, when exposed to the air, soon pass into a state of decomposition, or putrefaction. The oxygen of the air has a greater affinity than the nitrogen for the other elements, and unites with them very easily. In putrefaction the oxygen unites with the carbon to form carbonic acid, and with the hydrogen to form water. The hydrogen and nitrogen unite and form ammonia, and this occasions the peculiar, unpleasant odor of all putrefying bodies. In substances rich in sulphur and phosphorus, the hydrogen unites with them and forms sulphuretted and phosphoretted gases which are very offensive. Therefore, if we exclude the air or oxygen from such substances, we can arrest decomposition. This is done by keeping them in air-tight vessels, thus removing the oxygen from the outside; and by boiling or drying, to remove that which is diffused within. Freezing will have the same effect; also salting or preserving. The salt draws out the moisture, hardens the albumen, and prevents the access of oxygen. In preserving, by the use of a strong solution of sugar, the watery juices are drawn out and formed into a thick syrup which excludes the air.</p><p>There are some albuminous substances, such as isinglass and gelatine, which are taken as food; but, strictly speaking, they are not <emph rend="italic">flesh-formers. Isinglass</emph> is obtained from the sound, or swimming bladder, of the sturgeon, and is imported from Russia. It is not actually gelatine, but is transformed into it by boiling water. <emph rend="italic">Gelatine</emph> is obtained from bones. <emph rend="italic">Ossein</emph> is that part of the bones to which their strength and elasticity are due. It is insoluble in cold water, but is slowly dissolved and changed into gelatine by being boiled gently under a pressure sufficient to prevent the escape of steam. Gelatine is also obtained from tendons, calves' feet, fish scales, stag's horns, etc.</p><p>There are other varieties of nitrogenous food which are also carbonaceous.

Tea also contains iron and manganese.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Drinks, Beverages,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">Liquid Foods</emph> are classified as follows: <emph rend="italic">water,</emph> including rain, well, and mineral spring water; <emph rend="italic">mucilaginous, farinaceous,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">saccharine</emph> drinks, including toast water, Irish moss, and barley water, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, and other gruels; <emph rend="italic">aromatic</emph> or <emph rend="italic">astringent</emph> drinks, including, tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, and herb teas; <emph rend="italic">acidulous</emph> drinks, including lemonade, raspberry vinegar, and other fruit syrups; <emph rend="italic">animal broths,</emph> or drinks containing gelatine, including soups, broths, and beef tea; <emph rend="italic">emulsive</emph> drinks, including milk; <emph rend="italic">alcoholic</emph> and <emph rend="italic">intoxicating</emph> drinks, including wines, cider, beer, ale, porter, brandy, and whiskey.</p><p>Water is discussed under Non-Combustible Foods. Receipts for mucilaginous and acidulous drinks, animal broths, and herb teas are given in the chapter on Cookery for the Sick. The aromatic drinks are included in a separate article under the head of Beverages. Alcoholic drinks will not be discussed for want of space. Milk is food as well as drink, and deserves especial consideration.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Milk.</hd>
<p>Milk consists of three distinct substances, which separate from one another after standing awhile,--the cream, curd, and whey.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">cream</emph> is the carbonaceous part, and forms ten or twelve per cent of the whole. It consists of very small globules of fat, or butter, invisible to the naked eye, surrounded by a fine membrane of caseine or albuminous matter. These are dispersed in the milk at first; but as they are lighter than the other parts, they rise to the top of the milk in the form of cream. When the cream is churned, the membrane of each globule is ruptured, causing the butter to cohere in a separate mass. If all this caseine, or albuminous matter, be not removed, the butter soon becomes rancid. The butter has more margarine than oleine, and is therefore hard and firm instead of fluid. It contains butyric acid, which gives it its peculiar flavor.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">curd</emph> is the albuminous part of the milk, which separates in a solid form whenever milk sours or curdles. This separation is occasioned by the action of the oxygen in the air upon the nitrogen in the caseine, causing a portion of the caseine to ferment. This ferment acts upon the sugar of the milk, and converts it into lactic acid; and this acid acts as any other acid
 
<pb n="464" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=484"/>

would, and causes the sourness of the milk. The caseine is insoluble in water, but in the milk it is combined with soda, and this compound is soluble. So, when the milk sours, and a sufficient quantity of acid is formed, it seizes upon the soda, takes it away from the caseine, and forms lactate of soda. The caseine, being thus set free, shrinks, and gathers into an insoluble curdy mass. This separation is spontaneous; but it is often caused artificially, by the use of an acid,--usually rennet, which is the lining membrane of a calf's stomach. The curd thus separated is pressed and prepared in various forms of cheese. It contains the nutritious elements of the milk in a condensed, but somewhat indigestible form. Cheese is more digestible when made from fresh than from skimmed milk.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">whey</emph> is the water of the milk that separates from the curd in souring, and contains dissolved in it the sugar of milk and the saline and mineral ingredients. It is much better to use milk in its natural state than to use the butter or cheese obtained from it. It is the cheapest form in which animal food can be obtained, and should be used freely, especially by the young or weak.</p><p>Condensed milk, when well prepared, is convenient and valuable as an article of diet, if fresh milk cannot be obtained. It can only be made from pure milk, and is therefore perfectly harmless.</p></subsection>

<hd align="center" size="larger">CONDIMENTS.</hd>
<p>There is another class of foods, called <emph rend="italic">condiments,</emph> which should not pass unnoticed.</p><p>Food that "tastes good" is digested more readily, and assimilated more perfectly, so that we really derive more nourishment from it. We use many articles with our food to make it taste better, which are not in themselves valuable as food. But by stimulating the flow of saliva and gastric juice, and enhancing the fine flavor or food, they increase the pleasure of eating, and render digestion more complete. These are called condiments. They are not necessary to persons of sound digestion, and, with the exception of salt, should not be used by children, nor by any one in large quantities. In perfect digestion there is the first taste in the mouth and the after-taste of the digestive organs which require satisfaction. "Any cook may gratify the first, but the second requires a skilled chemist."</p>
 
<pb n="465" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=485"/>

<p>The principal condiments are salt, pepper, mustard, and some herbs, including mint, thyme, parsley, sage, marjoram, summer savory, and bay leaves; spices, including ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, mace, and allspice; and flavorings or extracts of lemon, vanilla, orange, almond, pineapple, etc.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Salt</emph> is the only condiment actually necessary to health (see page 455).</p><p><emph rend="italic">Pepper</emph> is a stimulant when taken in small quantities, but irritating if taken in excess. It is the dried berry of a climbing plant of the <emph rend="italic">piper</emph> family. The whole peppers are called <emph rend="italic">peppercorns.</emph> These peppercorns are ground, and we have <emph rend="italic">black pepper.</emph> The outer shells are sometimes removed before grinding, and these kernels ground give us <emph rend="italic">white pepper,</emph> which has a different flavor and is less pungent than black pepper. <emph rend="italic">Red</emph> or <emph rend="italic">Cayenne pepper</emph> consists of seed-vessels or pods of different species of <emph rend="italic">capsicum</emph> ground to powder. It is stimulating, and far more wholesome than the black pepper, though not as much used. It is valuable as a medicine.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Mustard</emph> is used as a condiment and medicine. It is made from seeds of black and white mustard, which are crushed between rollers, and then pounded in <implement>mortars.</implement> In small quantities it is good for digestion. Both red pepper and mustard, if used sparingly with indigestible food, like lobster and baked beans, are very useful.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">herbs</emph> are used dried or green, and when used judiciously, make meats, soups, and sauces more palatable.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Spices</emph> are used in cakes and articles of food containing sugar, and sometimes with meats. They are used whole, ground, and in the extract. Ginger is the most healthful, and is often used in sickness. It is a valuable stimulating tonic in hot weather. The other spices are better when mixed in small quantities, less of clove and more of cinnamon being used. When combined so that no one spice predominates, they are pleasant to the taste. Care should be taken lest they hide the natural flavor of the food.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Flavors</emph> are all good in small quantities. Almond, vanilla, lemon, and pineapple are often adulterated. They should never be added while the article is hot, as the heat wastes the strength of the flavor. Vanilla beans are better than the extract. It is always well, if possible, to use the fresh fruit juice.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Lemon juice</emph> and <emph rend="italic">vinegar,</emph> used in moderation, increase the solvent properties of the gastric juice, and are useful with meats and vegetables which are difficult of digestion.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">PROPER PROPORTION OF FOOD.</hd>
<p>These different kinds of food, <emph rend="italic">water, salts, sugar, starch, fat,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">albumen,</emph> must be combined in our diet; for a simple substance which fulfils only one of the purposes required in our food will not support life. A man cannot live on water or salt, yet he would soon die without them. A diet composed exclusively of fats, starch, or sugar is equally incapable of supporting life. The albuminous foods, though they are considered the most nutritious, must be combined with the others to produce the desired result.</p><p>Milk is the only substance prepared by nature expressly as an article of food. Seeds grow, and produce plants and fruits after their kind; but milk is prepared as the natural food of the young of all mammalia. A baby fed on milk develops in every part; therefore milk must supply every requisite for the growth of the young body, and the proportions in woman's milk may be taken as the standard for human food. Milk analyzed is found to contain water, salt, fat, sugar, and caseine,--the five elements of food. It has enough of flesh-producing elements to restore the daily waste, and enough heat-giving elements to feed the oxygen in breathing. But when the teeth are formed, the child's system needs a greater proportion of some elements than are supplied by the milk, and other foods are gradually added to the diet.</p><p>Eggs also contain all the necessary elements; a diet of seven eggs per day furnishes all the nutrition a person needs. But the elements in eggs are too highly condensed, and are not properly proportioned for a continuous diet.</p><p>Many articles of food do not contain all these elements, and it is very important to proportion our food rightly, so that one kind will supply what another lacks. A certain bulk is also necessary in our food to stimulate a thorough action of the digestive fluids. If the quantity be not sufficient to distend the stomach, so that the churning motion of the muscular coats can affect every part of the food, the digestion is imperfect. Dyspepsia is often caused by lack of sufficient quantity of food, and by weakness of the muscles of the stomach. If this requisite quantity be wholly nutritious or highly condensed food, capable of entire absorption, the effect is too stimulating, and serious disorders of the alimentary canal are the result. To remedy this, it is necessary to have a certain amount of innutritious
 
<pb n="467" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=487"/>

food, which furnishes the bulk required, and gives all parts of the digestive apparatus their proper amount of work to perform.</p><p>Many persons argue in favor of a vegetable diet, as we can obtain from vegetables all the necessary elements. There have been many cases known where people lived to an extreme age who used exclusively a vegetable diet, and others who lived equally as long upon animal food. But the general rule is, that we find the highest degree of bodily and mental vigor only among those who make use of a mixed diet. One of the strongest physiological arguments in favor of this rule is found in the structure and conformation of the teeth and alimentary canal. Part of the teeth are of the carnivorous, or flesh-eating kind, and part of the herbivorous, or vegetable-eating kind. The alimentary canal is equally well adapted to the digestion of animal or vegetable food, or an admixture of both. The proper proportion, by weight, is one third of animal, and two thirds of vegetable food.</p><p>"Nature has given us an unerring guide to a proper choice of diet. An unperverted appetite is the voice of the physical system making known its needs, and it may always be trusted to indicate the food necessary to the preservation of health. But as the voice of nature is often unheeded, it is necessary to exercise intelligence in selecting our food and adapting it to the circumstances of life. By a proper choice we can often counteract the effects of a violation of nature's laws."</p></section>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center" size="larger">ADAPTATION OF FOOD TO CLIMATE, AGE, OCCUPATION, AND STATE OF HEALTH.</hd>
<p>In examining the foods adopted by different nations and classes of people, we find that many choose instinctively the kind best adapted to their individual needs. The climate, occupation, and water influence their choice.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Climate.--</emph>Animal food is better for cold than for hot climates. We breathe more rapidly, take in more oxygen in cold weather, and the internal fire burns up more of the food. We exercise more, and this causes more rapid wearing out of muscle and flesh. Fat meat is not digested easily unless exercise be taken freely; more oxygen must be mixed with it to produce heat than is required for sugar and starch. In summer, when we exercise less, the waste is less, and we need less warmth-giving

ood. The starch and sugar obtained from fruits and vegetables are easily digested, and furnish sufficient warmth. The Esquimaux or Greenlander consumes a large quantity of <emph rend="italic">fat,</emph> or <emph rend="italic">blubber oil,</emph> the most condensed form of carbonaceous food. This gives him the amount of heat necessary in an extremely cold climate. With this blubber he mixes some indigestible substances to give the needed bulk for the perfect action of the stomach. The people of Norway, Sweden, and Russia use large quantities of <emph rend="italic">oily fish.</emph> In China, India, and other extremely hot climates, <emph rend="italic">rice</emph> is the universal food. Rice contains a very small amount of flesh-forming material, being mostly starch, which is changed into sugar by the action of the saliva. The natives of rice-eating countries owe much of their lack of spirit and energy to this defective diet. But when eaten with butter or olive oil, and made into curries, pilaf, and pilau, with a small amount of flesh or fish, it supplies all the elements necessary for life in such climates. The Spaniard in his <emph rend="italic">olla podrida--</emph>a stew of peas, bacon, or fowl, with red pepper--finds all the necessary elements. The red pepper, used so largely in the curries and other dishes common to hot climates, stimulates the liver, which is naturally weakened by the long-continued heat, and thus assists digestion. The Arab chooses <emph rend="italic">dates, parched grains, mare's</emph> or <emph rend="italic">camel's milk.</emph> The Turk adds to these <emph rend="italic">melons</emph> and <emph rend="italic">cucumbers.</emph> As we come northward again, we find more flesh-forming material in the <emph rend="italic">polenta</emph> (a dish made of Indian corn) and the <emph rend="italic">chestnuts, macaroni,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">cheese</emph> used by the Italians. The <emph rend="italic">pot-au-feu</emph> is the principal dish of every peasant in France. This furnishes the cheapest form of nutriment, and contains all the necessary elements of food.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">waters</emph> of a country sometimes determine the national food. In Ireland, where the waters are strongly impregnated with lime, they furnish what the potato, which is richer in potash and soda, lacks. When potatoes are combined with cabbage and pork, as in <emph rend="italic">kolcannon,</emph> the flesh-forming element is supplied; and this, on account of the cost of meat, the laboring classes are unable to obtain in any other form. In England and Scotland, where the waters are soft, oats and wheat, which are rich in phosphates, are the staple diet. When combined with milk, eggs, rice, peas, beans, bacon, and cheese, their food is complete.</p><p>To satisfy the natural instinct to obtain these five elements, we all prefer our bread with butter or cream, our meat with potatoes, our rice with butter, milk, or eggs; our fish we cook in fat; we eat liver with bacon and ham, or bacon with eggs;
 
<pb n="469" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=489"/>

we eat cheese with crackers, butter with cauliflower or cabbage, salt with all vegetables, oil with salad, and fresh vegetables with salt meat. Fruits and foods intended to be eaten raw contain a large proportion of water. This is supplied, when lessened by evaporation, by cooking and soaking in water. In cooking meats, we endeavor to retain all the juices, which are largely water. In spring we crave fresh green vegetables and salads, that we may have the <emph rend="italic">potash salts</emph> of which there has been a deficiency in the winter diet.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Occupation</emph> affects our choice of diet. Persons engaged in sedentary occupations cannot digest as much nor as easily as those who labor out of doors. They should have food that gives the greatest amount of nourishment in the smallest compass, and it should be served in the most digestible form. Those who tax their brains severely should have animal food and the most digestible forms of starchy and warmth-giving foods. Those who exercise freely in the open air may take a larger quantity, and it need not be the most digestible, as they require food that will stay by them. The laborer instinctively prefers potatoes underdone, or "with a bone in them;" and he chooses salt meat, not only because it is cheaper, but because it stands by him longer. The salt causes him to drink water freely, and this supplies the waste caused by excessive perspiration. A diet of vegetables, peas, beans, cheese, oatmeal, bacon, and the cheaper, more indigestible parts of meat properly cooked, is suitable for laboring people.</p><p><emph rend="italic">State of Health.--</emph>In selecting food with reference to health it must be remembered that there are certain general rules which have been established by the best authorities through many ages and in a great variety of circumstances; there are, however, some exceptions to these general rules. Milk is considered a wholesome food, yet there are some persons who cannot take it. Cheese is a cheap and nourishing food for laboring people, but there are some persons to whom it is an active poison. This is also true of oysters and strawberries. These exceptions are owing to some idiosyncrasy of the palate or weakness of the digestive organs, and should be regarded only as exceptions, which do not affect the general principle.</p><p>The application of these general principles, given throughout this book in connection with the various articles used as food, must be left to each individual; but to those who have given the subject no serious study a few hints may be helpful. They will be found in the article treating of Cooking for the Invalid.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">NOURISHING AND STIMULATING FOOD.</hd>
<p>There is another classification of food which it is well to consider briefly. In its effect upon the system food is nourishing and stimulating, or the reverse.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Nourishing foods</emph> are those which serve to develop perfectly every animal function, but do not increase the strength and speed of organic action beyond the point of full nutrition. Bread, vegetables, fruits, sugar, salt, and water are nourishing foods.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Nourishing and Stimulating Food.--</emph>All food that nourishes the body is in one sense stimulating, as it gives renewed energy to the bodily functions. But there are foods which impart a speed and energy to the organs above that necessary to perfect nutrition; these are termed stimulating foods. Animal food is of this class.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Stimulants.</emph>--Alcoholic drinks and condiments are classed as stimulants, because they impart no nourishment, but act simply as excitants to preternatural activity.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Innutritious foods</emph> are those which are not assimilated; which are by nature indigestible, or have been made so by improper combinations and modes of cooking. The bran of wheat, fried or greasy food, heavy bread, and rich soggy pastry are either entirely unassimilated, and therefore not nourishing, or they weaken the system by exciting particular organs to excessive action.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">DIGESTION.</hd>
<p>IN studying digestion, it is well to keep in mind the twofold division of food into nitrogenous, or flesh-forming, and carbonaceous, or heat-producing, elements. The process of digestion differs with the character of the food. The purpose of digestion is to change and combine all the elements of food into a fluid which will mingle with the blood, become assimilated, and furnish nutriment for the body.</p><p>Digestion is not confined to the stomach. It begins with <emph rend="italic">insalivation</emph> in the mouth, and, after <emph rend="italic">deglutition,</emph> is carried on in the stomach and intestines, the process continuing through the entire length of the alimentary canal,--a tube varying in diameter, and thirty-six feet in length.</p><p>The first process in digestion, as in any chemical analysis, is to crush the materials. The <emph rend="italic">teeth</emph> are the grinders for reducing the food. If we bolt our food or swallow it in lumps, the soft coats of the stomach are made to do the tearing and grinding work of the teeth. A solvent being necessary, the <emph rend="italic">saliva</emph> is secreted from the blood, and is poured through three pairs of glands into the mouth, each pair supplying a different saliva. This softens the starch and tender cellulose. Animals, like the beaver, which feed chiefly on woody matters, have very large salivary glands.</p><p>In health the saliva is always alkaline, especially during and after meals. It lubricates the mouth, and moistens the food so that it may assume a pasty condition. It is also necessary to the sense of taste, everything being tasteless that the saliva cannot dissolve. For this reason we cook and season our food so that it will excite the flow of the saliva.</p><p>"This saliva is poured into the mouth <emph rend="italic">not to be cast out,</emph> but to do a specific work, then pass into the stomach and be again absorbed. If the system be drained of the saliva by profuse spitting, as is the case with those who use tobacco freely, the order of bodily functions is reversed, and the mouth is made to do the work of the kidneys, which is to carry away a large amount of the superfluous water and all the waste salts."</p>
 
<pb n="472" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=492"/>

<p>The saliva consists mostly of water, with a very small amount of saline matter and about five parts in one thousand of <emph rend="italic">ptyalin,</emph> an albuminous ingredient, or ferment, which has the power of converting the starchy portions of food into sugar, and sugar into lactic acid, but does <emph rend="italic">not</emph> act upon nitrogenous food. The saliva froths easily, and aids in carrying air into the stomach.</p><p>This is the first step in digestion, and the most important, as any error in the beginning leads to evil consequences which affect the whole process. It is also important, because it is wholly a voluntary process. While the food is in the mouth, we may masticate it thoroughly or imperfectly, and swallow or reject it. But when deglutition has carried it into the stomach, it is wholly beyond our control, and we are not responsible for the remainder of the process, only so far as it may be affected by error in the first stages. Bread, potatoes, and all starchy foods should be thoroughly masticated, and mingled with the saliva. Meat may be swallowed hastily, or knives may be made to do the work of the teeth in masticating animal food; but no chemist can prepare an artificial saliva to be mixed with starchy food, to save the trouble of chewing it. If a piece of dry light bread be masticated thoroughly, it will crumble and be quickly mixed with the saliva, and become sweeter the longer it is kept in the mouth. The alkaline saliva changes the starch into sugar, and begins the digestion. Try to chew a piece of hot bread and it at once assumes a pasty condition, which neither teeth nor saliva can penetrate, and is swallowed involuntarily. A piece of putty would not be more indigestible. If this experiment be tried, no other argument would be needed against the use of hot bread.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">stomach</emph> carries on the second part of digestion. The presence of food excites the flow of a fluid called the <emph rend="italic">gastric juice,</emph> which is secreted in large quantities in the mucous membrane of the stomach. At the same time the muscular coats of the stomach contract, and produce a sort of churning motion, which carries the food round and round and over and over, exposing all parts of it to the action of the fluid. This gastric juice is always decidedly <emph rend="italic">acid</emph> in its nature, containing hydrochloric acid. The lactic acid formed from the sugar in the mouth is also present in the stomach. This acid arrests the work begun in the mouth on the starchy foods, renders the alkali neutral, and acts only on albuminous food. It contains an albuminous ingredient, or ferment, called <emph rend="italic">pepsin,</emph> in about the same proportion as the ptyalin of the saliva. The pepsin
 
<pb n="473" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=493"/>

mixed with the lactic acid is powerful enough to dissolve all the albumen and fibrine of flesh food into albuminose, and sets free the starch, sugar, and fat, melts the fat, but does not change either. When there is an excess of deficiency of acid in the stomach, the digestion is abnormal. Pepsin is sometimes used as a remedy for dyspepsia, and is obtained from the stomachs of young, healthy pigs which are kept hungry.</p><p>As all food which is to nourish the system must be converted into a fluid form, any substances which are taken in fluid form and afterward solidified in the stomach, as blood or juice of flesh, milk, and raw eggs, must be changed again to a permanent liquid form before they can be absorbed. All nitrogenous matters are not only dissolved by the gastric fluid, but are modified so as to remain dissolved. These changed albuminous matters are called <emph rend="italic">peptones.</emph> Oil plays an important part in these changes, so that, although oil is not digested, it serves a useful purpose in passing through the stomach.</p><p>The stomach would digest itself were it not protected by a sheathing of mucus and by a continual forming of cells called <emph rend="italic">epithelium,</emph> during the process of digestion. The liquid or watery portions of food enter at once into the circulation by absorption. If too much water be taken with food, it dilutes the gastric juice and retards the digestion; as all that is not needed must be absorbed before digestion can go on.</p><p>Digestion is also retarded by the presence of very hot or very cold food, as everything taken into the stomach has to be changed to the normal temperature of 100&#176;. A large amount of food overloads the stomach, distends the muscular coats, and lessens the power of motion. Too little food is also a mistake, as the stomach needs a certain amount of bulk to work upon. Continual or irregular eating is wholly contrary to the intention of nature, since it does not allow the stomach time to rest and to form new cells to secrete digestive fluids. Flesh food that is finely minced, like hash, croquettes, and many entr&#233;es, passes rapidly through the stomach without being dissolved by the gastric juice; but when taken in larger pieces it remains long enough to be all digested.</p><p>The digestive power of the stomach is weakened when there is any undue action in any other part of the body, as in great muscular exertion or in powerful excitement of the brain. Therefore we should eat sparingly at first, when fatigued by exercise or study or when unduly excited, and should rest awhile after eating.</p>
 
<pb n="474" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=494"/>

<p>Lactic acid, small portions of sugar and digested nitrogenous substances, pass into the blood by absorption through the stomach veins. Thus the contents of the stomach leave it in two directions: a portion is absorbed through the coats of the stomach by the process of osmose, or the passage of fluids through animal membranes; the remainder passes through the pyloric opening into the duodenum and intestines for the completion of digestion. Food from the stomach enters the duodenum in an <emph rend="italic">acid</emph> state, and in the intestines is mingled with three <emph rend="italic">alkaline</emph> fluids, all containing soda.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">pancreatic fluid,</emph> secreted from the pancreas, digests the fatty matters. It breaks the large granules of oil and fat into a great many minute particles, and converts them into a milky liquid called <emph rend="italic">chyle,</emph> which mixes freely with water and passes through the tissues of the intestines into the lacteals. It also changes the starch into sugar, and the sugar into lactic acid, but has very little action on albuminous substances.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">bile,</emph> secreted from the liver, plays an important part in intestinal digestion, the exact nature of which is unknown. Bile is a complex liquid, consisting of biliary acid in combination with soda. It certainly aids in the absorption of fat, and many suppose its purpose is to lubricate the walls of the intestinal canal; from its soapy consistency it effects a smooth, non-irritating passage of the contents. If there be any lack or surplus of the bile, it soon produces an injurious result in the system. The bile is in the intestines, and not in the stomach except when the action of the stomach is inverted, in nausea and vomiting; then the bile is forced up into the stomach instead of down into the intestines.</p><p>The <emph rend="italic">intestinal juice,</emph> secreted in the mucous membrane the entire length of the intestine, combines the active and digestive powers of all the other secretions.</p><p>The lactic acid is formed so rapidly from the digestion of sugar that the contents of the intestine quickly becomes acidulous, and this completes the digestion of any portions of nitrogenous food not fully digested in the stomach. The combined amount of the salivary, gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and intestinal fluids secreted daily is twenty-one pints, of which the gastric juice forms more than one half. There are mechanical aids to intestinal as well as stomach digestion. The writhing, worm-like motion, or peristaltic movement, of the muscular coats of the intestines forces the food downward, and exposes all portions of it to the digestive fluids.</p>
 
<pb n="475" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=495"/>

<p>Notwithstanding all these powerful agents in digestion, a portion of useful matter passes through the intestines unchanged; and if there be a deficiency of either fluid, or a weakness of the muscular coats, or too great a quantity of irritating substance, like cellulose, woody fibre, bran, etc., the amount is increased. This is carried, with the innutritious portion, into the larger intestine, and forms a part of the excretions.</p></section>
<section class1="generalnonfood">
<hd align="center" size="larger">ABSORPTION.</hd>
<p>The nutritive and perfectly digested portions of food are absorbed partly by the veins of the stomach, entering at once into the circulation, and partly by the intestines. The lining membrane of the intestines folds over and over upon itself, like a ruffle, along the entire edge; this is full of little tubes, or <emph rend="italic">villi,</emph> which absorb the chyle.</p><p>The blood vessels absorb the nutritive elements from the villi and carry them to the veins in two ways: 1st. Through the portal vein into the liver, where it penetrates every part of the liver, then passes out through the hepatic vein into the veins near the heart; 2d. Through the lacteals, which are attached to the lining membrane of the intestines and empty into the thoracic duct, a tube extending along the spine, and then into the subclavian vein, which lies in the left side of the neck, under the collar bone. The veins also bring with them the lymph,--a thin colorless fluid which comes from the absorbent vessels situated all over the body, and which contains the worn-out particles.</p><p>Then the venous blood, supplied from the lacteals with new material, and from the lymphatic vessels with waste materials, enters the heart through the upper door, or right auricle, passes through the valves down into the right ventricle; out through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where, as purple venous blood, it penetrates to the most remote capillaries.</p><p>If the lungs be full of pure fresh air, the oxygen changes the purple blood into red blood, and burns up the impurities. The waste products of the combustion of carbon and hydrogen are expelled from the lungs at every breath in the form of carbonic acid and watery vapor; and not until now can the new elements in the blood, obtained from the food, become in reality food, or perfect blood.</p>

<p>This oxygenized or vitalized blood now returns from the lungs, and enters the heart through the left upper door, or left auricle; the valves open and allow it to pass into the left ventricle, then out through the a&#246;rta, or great artery, from which the arteries carry it to the capillaries all over the system.</p><p>In the capillaries the new material is deposited wherever needed, and changed by cell growth into new tissue. The lymphatic vessels take up all that is not needed, with the worn-out portions; and the veins then carry this impure blood back again to the lungs and heart.</p><p>Thus a continuous circulation is established, the blood coursing over the whole body once in every three to five minutes, the time varying with the amount of exercise and the state of health. During this circulation the combustible compounds are burned by the oxygen received into the blood in the lungs, the carbonaceous products of combustion are expelled through the lungs as carbonic acid gas and watery vapor, and the nitrogenous products through the kidneys in the form of urates.</p><p>"This process of digestion and absorption is really a kind of preliminary cooking process, going on from the mouth downwards all the way to the colon; and from every part of the long canal tiny lacteals and absorbing veinlets carry off contributions of food either to the general store of chyle, or to the venous blood which is hurrying back to the heart."</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">NUTRITION.</hd>
<p>"Albumen is the basis of all animal nutrition. This is seen in the bird's egg during incubation. Under the influence of warmth and oxygen, all the tissues, membranes, and bones are developed from albumen."</p><p>In the human body a nutritious fluid is prepared from the food, and supplies materials for growth and repair. This fluid is the blood, and when examined under the microscope is found to consist of a clear colorless fluid, of a saline, alkaline, and albuminous nature, and an immense number of infinitely minute blood globules, or corpuscles. These corpuscles consist of an albuminous membrane called globulin, filled with a red coloring matter, hematine, in which there is much iron.</p><p>This liquid albuminous portion of the blood must be changed to fibrine before it can nourish the muscles of the body. The
 
<pb n="477" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=497"/>

change of the gluten, caseine, and all the varieties of albuminous food into fibrine is a gradual process, begun in the lacteals, continued in the circulation of the blood, and completed in the lungs by the oxygen which they receive in breathing. This fibrine remains in the liquid state, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood, and is distributed by the circulation into all parts of the structure, where it gradually coagulates into a network of tough thread-like fibres, enclosing in its meshes the blood corpuscles, and is changed by cell growth into new tissue, solid flesh and bone.</p><p>The nervous system is also built and repaired from albumen. Nervous matter is about seven per cent albumen, and is the material by which we are put into relation with the external world. By it we see, hear, feel, taste, smell, and are conscious of existence.</p><p>Each elementary cell or particle of tissue, whether of bone, flesh, or nerves, seems to have a sort of gland-like power, not only of attracting materials from the blood, but of causing them to assume its structure and participate in its properties. The bones and teeth select and appropriate the phosphates of lime, and magnesia, also fluorine. The muscles and nerves take fibrine, phosphates of magnesia, and potash. The cartilages seek for soda; the hair, skin, and nails are made up of silica. Iron is needed in the coloring matter of the blood, the black pigment of the eye, and in the hair. Sulphur exists in the hair, and phosphorus in the brains. The glands of the mouth take the substances necessary to form saliva; those of the eye, the elements of tears; the coats of the stomach, gastric juice; and the liver, bile. Each part of the body has the power to select, from the common supply, the material which suits it best for building and growing.</p><p>If the conversion of albumen into fibrine be incomplete, the tissues are imperfectly nourished. The formation of tubercles in the lungs is caused by half-formed cells and coagulated albumen deposited in the lungs. This is caused by a deficiency of the oily matter, which is necessary for the perfect formation of cells and the growth of healthy tissue. Hence for these cases physicians prescribe cod-liver oil.</p><p>Distilled spirits coagulate the albumen which ought to go into the blood; this prevents the proper digestion of food, and causes one of the great evils resulting from their use. The nervous tissue is thus deprived of nourishment, which is one of the causes of delirium tremens.</p>
 
<pb n="478" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=498"/>

<p>Every twinge of pain in neuralgia is the nerves crying out for better blood. Imperfect digestion and assimilation of food are the chief causes of neuralgia.</p><p>Nutrition, though seemingly complex, is really a simple process; albumen is changed to fibrine, and fibrine to flesh. The relation of each to the other has been aptly compared to that of the raw cotton, the spun yarn, and the woven fabric.</p><p>The minute corpuscles in the blood are constantly building up the body, very much as the coral insect builds its structure. The work of each corpuscle is too small for our conception; but, taken in the aggregate, the result is the wonderful growth and renovation of the human body. And what is still more wonderful, every organ of the body is on the alert to keep the whole system in natural health. The activity of the vessels which remove the waste particles from the blood is untiring. The kidneys are the scavengers of the body, and stand next to the lungs in renovating it. If too much water be drunk, the kidneys, lungs, and skin carry it off, for fear that the blood should become too watery. We may cease to convey food into the body for days with no evil consequences; but let the removing organs cease operations for a single day, and disease ensues.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">LIFE AND MOTION.<ref target="n3" height="superscript">1</ref></hd>

<ednote>The following note appears on the bottom of page 478 in the original text.</ednote>
<p id="n3" size="smaller">1 This article is mainly an abstract of the chapters on the "Circulation of Matter," contained in "Johnston's Chemistry of Common Life." It is inserted here as bearing upon the general subject of food, and with the hope that all who read this will read the original.</p>

<p><emph rend="italic">Circulation of Water.</emph>--As a plant grows, water from the soil or air unites chemically with carbon, and forms the woody fibre of the stem, the sugar of the sap, and the starch of the seed. When the plant dies, the water is again set free from its structure and passes into the air. The starch and sugar, also, which the plant yields having been consumed by some animal, the water which they contain passes into the air through the lungs and skin. Thus the same water is caused to revolve in a circle of life-sustaining combinations. Within a single hour it may be in some vegetable structure in the form of sugar; then it may pass into and circulate through some animal system and be discharged as vapor from the lungs, and afterwards become
 
<pb n="479" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=499"/>

absorbed by thirsty leaves and aid in the growth of flowers and fruits.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Circulation of Carbon.</emph>--Vegetables, which are largely starch and carbon, absorb carbonic-acid gas from the atmosphere, which contains thirty-three grains of carbon in every square inch. If the world were all dry land, and covered with dense vegetation, all the carbon would be extracted from the atmosphere in twenty-three years. This carbonic acid is restored to the atmosphere by the waste and decay of vegetable matter, by the exhalations from animals, and by combustion.</p><p>The leaf of a living plant draws in carbonic acid gas from the air, and gives off the oxygen contained in it, retaining only the carbon. The roots drink in moisture from the soil; and out of the carbon and water contained in it the plant forms starch, sugar, fat, and other substances.</p><p>The animal takes the starch, sugar, or fat into its stomach, and draws in oxygen through its lungs. New chemical combinations are thus formed, undoing the work of the plant, and sending back to the air, from the lungs and skin, both the starch and oxygen, in the form of carbonic-acid gas and water. The same material is constantly circulating,--now floating in invisible air, now forming the substance of the growing plant, now of the moving animal, and now diffusing itself through the air ready to go its round again. It forms part of a vegetable to-day; to-morrow it is in a man's backbone; a week hence it may have passed through another plant and into another animal.</p><p>In burning coal, we cause its carbon to unite with the oxygen of the air and to disappear as carbonic acid gas. The carbon returns to the atmosphere from which it may have been taken millions of years ago when it was appropriated by the growing plants, which, in the form of vegetable matter, were afterwards buried beneath the surface of the earth only to reappear ages subsequently in the form of fuel. The earth itself breathes out carbonic acid, sometimes with water, sometimes alone. It sparkles in the springs of Carlsbad and Seltzer; it kills man and beast in the terrible "Valley of Death" in the island of Java.</p><p>In this way is supplied the loss of that which is daily buried by the shell fish and coral insects in the limestone formations and coral growths. These rocks contain, chained down in seemingly everlasting imprisonment, two fifths of their weight of carbonic acid.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Circulation of Nitrogen.</emph>--Gluten and fibrine are distinguished from starch and fat by containing nitrogen. The nitrogen forms
 
<pb n="480" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=500"/>

four fifths of the air. It exists also in ammonia, and in aqua fortis, or nitric acid. These two compound bodies exist and are found in the soil; and from the soil the nitrogen is taken up by the plants, and gluten is formed. When the animal consumes the gluten, it builds up and renews the waste of its several parts. The gluten of the plant is transformed into the flesh and tissues of the living animal. Thus the nitrogen of the soil through the plant has reached the dignity of being a part of breathing, intellectual man.</p><p>Having reached this form, this restless element, nitrogen, grows weary of inactivity and moves on. Not only the living body as a whole is in constant motion, but even its minutest parts are continually active. "They are like the population of a great city moving to and fro, coming and going continually, weeded out and removed every hour by deaths and departures, yet as unceasingly kept up in numbers by new in-comers, changing from day to day so insensibly as to escape observation, yet so evidently that after a few years scarcely a known face can be discovered among the congregated thousands." Scarcely has the gluten of the plant been fitted comfortably to its place in the muscle, the skin, or the hair of the animal, when it begins to be dissolved again and is removed.</p><p>The living animal absorbs much oxygen from the air by its lungs. One part of it converts the carbon of the food into carbonic acid; another portion is built into the substance of the body; a large part is employed in dissolving and removing the waste in urea, uric acid, etc. This urea and uric acid return to the soil from which the nitrogen they contain originally came, and where they are reconverted into ammonia, nitric acid, and other substances, and are now ready to enter into new roots and go the rounds again.</p><p>The undigested gluten is rejected in the animal droppings, mingles with the soil, and is changed to ammonia and nitric acid. The vegetables which die undergo natural decay, and again enter the soil and air as elements. Animal bodies themselves die at last, and the nitrogen they contain is made to assume the forms in which plants are able to take it up. The ammonia and volatile compounds of nitrogen, produced by animal and vegetable decay, rise in the form of gas or vapor, and escape into the air. The rains of heaven wash the ammonia out and bring it back to the earth. Part of it is, however, resolved into elementary nitrogen, and is thus lost to plants. To make up for this loss, nitric acid is formed in the air in small quantities.
 
<pb n="481" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=501"/>

Through the agency of the electric currents the oxygen and nitrogen of the air unite to form nitric acid. Ammonia is given off by volcanoes, and is returned to the earth by the rains and snows.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Circulation of Mineral Matter.</emph>--Everything which the animal body contains is derived, directly or indirectly, from vegetable foods; and the mineral or ash it leaves, when burned, must have come from the soil through the plant. When the animal dies, its body sooner or later returns to the soil. So we have another circle in which the earthy matter of animals and plants moves. It ascends from the soil to the plant, then to the animal, and back again to mother earth, so that it is really "dust to dust."</p><p>The plant does not absorb all mineral matters, but selects the rarer and more precious materials from the soil, and such as are held in solution by water. Phosphoric acid, lime, magnesia, and saline matter, of which common salt is a representative, are the principal substances chosen. The animal eating the vegetable, these substances enter its stomach, and are dissolved and enter the blood. The vessels provided for the purpose select the required material, and, like ships in commerce, sail away on the blood rivers to their destined havens. The saline portion is carried to the blood and tissues. The phosphate of lime goes to the bones, and phosphate of potash to the muscles. After a time the animal, partly as it wastes and finally when it dies, returns to the soil all that the plant took from it. New plants receive it, and it goes the rounds again.</p><p>So, over and over again, as the modeller fashions his clay, plant and animal are formed out of the same material. Is all senseless matter to be constantly working, and are we intelligent beings to idle away a precious but limited existence? One should learn from this always to work for a definite purpose.</p><p>How lovely is the plant in its position of bond-servant of man! How willing and interesting! It serves till death, yet rises again rejoicing as ever, when spring returns, to renew its destined toil.</p><p>The least alteration in the natural constitution of things would insure the extinction of animal and vegetable life.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.</hd>
<p>THE Course of Instruction at the Boston Cooking School, which is inserted on <ref target="linc515.jpg">page 495,</ref> may be helpful to those interested in establishing Schools of Cookery.</p><p>Beginning with the care of a fire and the simple dishes in daily use, the course includes illustrations of every principle involved in cookery. Special attention is given to bread, soups, entr&#233;es, meats, healthful puddings, desserts, and dishes for the invalid.</p><p>The course is so arranged that each lesson offers a bill of fare for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The number of dishes prepared at each lesson should be determined by the age and ability of the pupils, and the character of the instruction desired. In some classes it is desirable to have the dishes which are prepared served at the close of the lesson; thus an opportunity is given to instruct in laying the table and serving the food.</p><p>With beginners or very young pupils, it is better to teach only two or three dishes at a lesson. Taking the first lesson in the first course for an example, a practice lesson may be conducted after the following plan. Explain first the construction of the stove and the making and care of a fire. When convenient, each pupil should take the entire care of a fire for one lesson. Let the pupils become familiar with the kitchen utensils, their names, and uses. The receipts should be read, and copied, if no text-book be used, and a portion of the work assigned each pupil. After the receipts are given, one pupil should prepare the yeast, another mix the bread, another pare and put the potatoes to soak, and another cut the bread for cro&#251;tons, and wipe and trim the chops. The tables should be so arranged that pupils may watch what others are doing while busy about their own work. The attention of the whole class should be called to the making of the bread and yeast, and each in turn should help in the kneading. After the bread and yeast are set to rise, the potatoes should be put on to boil, the soup started, and the German toast prepared and left to soak. Those who prepared the bread and yeast may lay the table. When the potatoes and 
 
<pb n="484" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=504"/>

soup are done, keep them hot while the chops are being cooked, the toast browned, and the coffee made. Keep the other dishes hot while the soup is being served. Let the pupils share in turn the duties of waitress and hostess.</p><p>In the second lesson the teacher should have ready for baking bread mixed the night before, and also some cold boiled potatoes. While one pupil is preparing the pans for the bread, another may shape part of the dough into a loaf, and then all may assist in shaping rolls or biscuit. The blanc-mange should be prepared next, and put away to cool. Then the meat and potatoes chopped for the hash, and the eggs boiled in various ways. One or two eggs will be sufficient to illustrate soft-boiled eggs, and may be eaten at once. The hard-boiled eggs may be used in making scalloped eggs. The gruels may be made at any time, and tested when ready. Then start the potato soup, bake the rolls or bread, cook the fried or creamed potatoes and the hash, and while the table is being laid and the soup finished, another pupil may broil the fish.</p><p>Where it is not desirable to have a lunch, or where only a few lessons are given, it is better to have each lesson devoted wholly to one subject. In a lesson on bread, several kinds of bread may be mixed, and that baked which was mixed the night before. Also make soda biscuit, rye muffins, and gems or corn cake.</p><p>Or arrange the lessons with reference to the principles and methods of cooking, as shown in the programme for a course of lectures.</p><p>In practice classes the pupils should do all the work under the guidance of the teacher. It is not enough that the work be done for them, letting them learn by looking on. They should <emph rend="italic">do</emph> for themselves, the teacher directing and explaining. It is better to run the risk of spoiling a dish than not to give the pupils a chance to try, as a failure is often the best lesson pupils can have. Then they will know what to avoid when working alone. In large classes or in a demonstration lesson, the work may all be done by the teacher with the assistance of the advanced pupils.</p><p>During a lesson instruction should be given in washing dishes and in the buying and care of materials used in cooking, and the pupils should be encouraged to ask questions freely. Examine the pupils frequently in the general principles of cookery, and the nature of food materials. Although it is not necessary to memorize every receipt, yet every pupil should be sufficiently
 
<pb n="485" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=linc&#38;PageNum=505"/>

familiar with the rules to be able to make bread, soup, coffee, several kinds of puddings and dishes for invalids, and to cook a variety of meats and vegetables, without referring to a receipt. Each one should have a correct idea of proportions, that she may detect any error in a new receipt.</p><p>Pupils should dress appropriately for their work, cultivate habits of neatness and order, and never be encouraged to think that any part of cooking is disagreeable or unworthy of their very best effort; and the teacher should have unlimited patience with all, however inexperienced or careless they may be.</p></section>

<hd align="center" size="larger">THE HEALTH FOOD COMPANY<lb/>

OF NEW YORK</hd>
<p>is now in the tenth year of its existence. Its valuable and important work has been recognized and commended by thousands of physicians, by many writers for the medical and general press, and by multitudes of the sick and suffering who have found health and comfort through its products. It has had many imitators, but it has conscientiously adhered to its original mission of preparing</p><p align="center" rend="italic">PERFECT FOODS FOR SICK AND WELL.</p><p>Basing its work upon exact science, and being presided over by a scientific man, it has gained the support and co-operation of the scientific world. Prof. Albert N. Leeds, Public Analyst for the State of New Jersey and Professor of Chemistry in the Stevens Institute, has microscopically examined and chemically analyzed most of the Health Food Company's products, and asserts their great excellence. (In our limited space we can only briefly quote from the Professor's published statement, but we are assured that he will cheerfully mail a copy of the pamphlet to any one who shall address him at the College named, situated in Hoboken, New Jersey.) He found in the Health Food Company's <emph rend="bold">Whole Wheat Flour 16.74</emph> per cent of albuminoids, chiefly gluten, thus showing its great superiority over all other bread-flours in general use. Of the "Franklin Mills" Flour, said to be made from "entire wheat," he writes: "It contains 8.55 per cent of albuminoids, chiefly gluten, together with a very large percentage of cellulose or finely-ground bran. It is greatly lacking in nutritive elements." Prof. Leeds further testifies that the <emph rend="bold">Glutens</emph> prepared by the Health Food Company are richer in the gluten element than any which he has been able to obtain, whether of American or foreign origin, and more than twice as rich as a so-called gluten made by Farwell &#38; Rhines, of Rochester. He also finds by analysis that "Robinson's Prepared Barley Flour" contains only <emph rend="bold">5.13</emph> per cent of albuminoids, while the Health Food Company's barley flour, retailing for less than one-eighth as much, contains <emph rend="bold">13.83</emph> per cent, showing it to be nearly three times as rich in substantial nutriment. The flours and foods of the Health Food Company are nourishing in health and remedial in sickness. Their good work is in the improvement of the blood-making processes, in better digestion, in increased nutrition. Many physicians have testified to the readiness of diseases to yield to their treatment when the patients have been sustained by the bland, soluble, non-irritating, nourishing nutriments prepared by the Health Food Company. Its products still stand at the head of the long list of food preparations for infants and invalids, for the sick who seek to recover health and strength, for the strong who desire to remain strong. It has elevated food and its preparation to the dignity of a science, and has sought to render itself wholly worthy of the warm encomiums so ably pronounced by scholars, physicians, and scientists, conspicuous among whom stand the Rev. John F. Clymer, Prof. Austin Flint, and Mrs. Laura Lyman Shipherd, Editor of "Home Interests" in the <emph rend="italic">New York Tribune.</emph></p><p>Pamphlets, price-lists, and all particulars are freely mailed to all inquirers.

<hd align="center">A Good Cement for Iron.</hd>
<p>A correspondent of The English Mechanic says that he used the following recipe with the greatest success for the cementing of iron railing tops, iron gratings to stoves, etc., and with such effect as to resist the blows of a sledge hammer: Take equal parts of sulphur and white lead, with about a sixth of borax; incorporate the three so as to form one homogeneous mass. When going to apply it, wet it with strong sulphuric acid and place a thin layer of it between the two pieces of iron, which should then be pressed together. In five days it will be perfectly dry, all traces of the cement having vanished, and the iron will have the appearance of having been welded together.--Boston Budget.</p></div>
