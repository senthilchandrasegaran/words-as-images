<p>DEAR GIRLS:</p>
<p>This book tells the story of Mary Frances, a little girl whose great ambition was to help her mother. So anxious was she to do this that even the humble Kitchen People became her teachers and instructors. They talked to her, a thing never heard of before; helped her over the hard places, and explained mysterious secrets she could never otherwise have understood. They wove around a simple little book of recipes her mother had made for her the spell of Fairyland; they led her through a series of delightful adventures such as never happened to any girl before, in which she lived for three whole happy weeks, and out of which she emerged no longer a little girl, but a real little woman.</p>
<p>Some very wise people would call this a story book, some a manual training book, and others a cookery book, but Mary Frances knows better; she

knows that it is a Book within a Book that introduced her to Aunty Rolling Pin and a lot of other dear, dear friends, such as no little girl ever had before, and whom she now wishes to introduce for the first time to all other little girls. (I know that she gained their consent to do this because she told me so.)</p>
<p>In the hope that Mary Frances' wish may be realized, this record of her adventures is sent out to the girls of America with the best wishes of</p>

<p>ALL the Kitchen People were terribly excited.</p>
<p>"I see my finish!" puffed Tea Kettle from his perch on the stove.</p>
<p>"That's slang!" snapped Sauce Pan, who sat near by.</p>
<p>"Slang or no slang," said Tea Kettle, "I'll melt if somebody doesn't come fill me soon."</p>
<p>"Where's the cook? Where's the mistress?" asked <implement>Boiler Pan.</implement></p>
<p>"Why, the cook's left--left this morning and the mistress's sick. What's that I smell burning?"</p>
<p>"That's the potatoes in the oven," said Toaster.</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed <implement>Coffee Pot.</implement></p>

won't help! If you say Whew! to an oven door, will it open?--Somebody open the door!"</p>
<p>"Good idea, Saucy!" exclaimed Tea Kettle. "You might try it yourself!"</p>
<p>"Owoooh! O-w-o-o-o-h!" strained little Sauce Pan at the heavy door. "O-w-o-o-o-h! I can't-t budge it! Cauch! Cawc! Ochee!" he coughed. "What smoke! Somebody else come try!"</p>
<p>"Get out of the way, then," said Big Iron Pot, making heavily toward the stove.</p>
<p>"Knew your arms were too short," laughed Tea Kettle, seeing Iron Pot couldn't reach the knob.</p>
<p>"Well, they're as long as yours," said Iron Pot angrily.</p>
<p>"Kick it open!" sug-gest-ed Sauce Pan. "Everybody allowed one kick!"</p>
<p>"First go!" exclaimed Iron Pot.</p>
<p>Whack! came a muffled sound. Then, "Oh, my poor feet! Oh! Oh!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked Sauce Pan.</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Big Iron Pot, hopping around on one little leg, and holding the other with his hands. "Only I wish you'd had 'First go!'"</p>
<illustration><caption>"I wish you'd had 'First go!'"</caption><description>An animated black pot hops away from an old-fashioned stove, holding one foot in his hands.

<p>"Well," declared Tea Kettle, "unless help comes soon, we may as well give up all hope of rescue. This is dreadful!"</p>
<p>"Listen, then," ticked Mantel Clock, who didn't mind the smoke. "I know a secret: the dear little girl--"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, we know!" cried the Kitchen People.</p>
<p>"Well!" asked Mantel Clock, "what do you know?"</p>
<p>"The little girl--that there is a little girl--"</p>
<p>"Is that all you know?" demanded Mantel Clock. "Now, when people interrupt--"</p>
<p>"Just dying to tell," said Sauce Pan in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>"Please, please, tell us the secret," begged the Kitchen People.</p>
<p>"Well," Mantel Clock ran on, "the dear little girl that lives in our house is going to learn to cook. What d'you say if we all turn in and help her?"</p>
<p>"Goody-goody!" Aunty Rolling Pin laughed so she nearly rolled off the table.</p>

<p>IN ran the dearest, sweetest little girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, you poor Tea Kettle!" she cried. "You'll boil to death!" and she pulled it over to the cooler part of the stove.</p>
<p>Tea Kettle simmered his thanks.</p>
<p>"What can be burning?" she asked. "What can it be?" and she looked all over the stove.</p>
<p>"I do believe it's something in the oven!"</p>
<p>As she pulled open the oven door, out rolled the burnt potatoes.</p>
<p>"Now," she said, "now, for the toast," and she caught up her mother's apron from a hook, and tied it just under her arms, crossing the strings in front.</p>
<p>The Kitchen People held their breath to see what would happen next.</p>
<p>Suddenly she clapped her hands.</p>
<p>"The very thing!" she cried, and ran out of the room. In a minute she was back, with a little book in her hands.</p>

<p>I believe--I just believe it tells about toast. Yes, here it is, right on the first page:</p>

<p>"Let's see if there is any stale bread. I should think so! a whole loaf! Now, I'll cut two slices, and since I want it to be very nice, I'll cut off the crusts. I guess that will be enough; oh, how I wish somebody was here to help me."</p>
<p>"There is somebody--<emph rend="italic">I'll</emph> help!"</p>

<p>Mary Frances looked round in amazement. Seeing no one, "Why,--where? Why,--who are <emph rend="italic">you?"</emph> she asked.</p>
<p>"I'm Tea Kettle, Miss," said Tea Kettle, lifting his lid very politely. "I'm gladly at your service, if you please."</p>
<p>"And I!" It was Sauce Pan.</p>
<p>"And I!" cried <implement>Boiler Pan.</implement></p>
<p>Mary Frances could scarcely believe her ears.</p>
<p>"My," she said, "can you all talk? and will you help me? Isn't that grand!--But how you did s'prise me! Won't we have a lovely time!"</p>
<p>"Look at the fire! Look at the fire!"</p>
<p>"What a tiny voice!" thought the little girl,--but she quickly took the lids off the stove. Some very bright coals stared up at her.</p>
<p>"The fire is fine," she said aloud, and she looked all about to find where the voice came from, but she saw no one.</p>
<p>"Look down, please!" said the same tiny voice, this time very distinctly.</p>
<p>There stood the funniest little wire man, no higher than the little girl's elbow.</p>
<illustration><caption>"And I!"</caption><description>An animated saucepan with a smiling face, arms, and legs.</description></illustration>

<p>"You didn't see me," laughed the little man, "but I know how to make toast."</p>
<p>"Of course!" said the little girl, "you're--why, you're the Toaster!"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," said the little man, with a bow, "at your service, Miss Mary Frances."</p>
<p>"Try me, and see what I can do," went on Toaster Man. "Just put a slice of that bread into my head, and hold me over the fire."</p>
<p>Mary Frances leaned over and gravely put a slice of bread in Toaster. He looked so funny standing there that she wanted to smile, but thought it wouldn't be exactly polite to so helpful a friend. But when he said, "Slide up my collar," in a thick, smothery sort of voice, she laughed aloud before she could stop, but turned the sound into a cough so quickly that Toaster Man looked up at her queerly only a moment; and she pulled the ring up until it held the bread tightly in place.</p>
<p>"Now, lift me up over the fire!" he demanded.</p>
<p>Mary Frances hesitated--she couldn't tell where to take hold of him.</p>
<p>"Never mind my legs," he said, as though he read

her thoughts, "I'll see to them," and he folded them up so close that when Mary Frances lifted him up, she could find no sign of them.</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll be burnt!" she cried, as she held what Toaster Man had called his head over the bright fire.</p>
<p>"Not I," he laughed, "not I. I like it. It's the toast that'll be burnt, if I'm not turned over soon."</p>
<p>Mary Frances took the hint, and turned Toaster carefully over.</p>
<p>"Not too close to the coals at first, Little Miss," said the little fellow. "Now,--closer! That's it!"</p>
<p>"How is it?" he asked, as Mary Frances took him from the fire.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful piece of toast!" she cried.</p>
<p>"Grand-if-i-cent!" exclaimed Toaster. "Now, you do the next piece without my saying a word--but first spread that with butter, and put it in the oven. Now, you read in your book, and see if that's not the way to make Buttered Toast."</p>
<p>Mary Frances opened her book.</p>
<p>"Read it out!" said the little man.</p>
<p>"When I speak that way, Mother tells me to say 'Please,'" said she.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon," said the little man, "Please."</p>
<p>So Mary Frances read:</p>

<p>"That's it! that's what I told you," cried the little fellow. "I'm always right about toast. Can you make the next slice without a word more?"</p>
<p>"I think so," said Mary Frances; and she didn't utter a sound until she had taken the second piece out of Toaster.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful piece of toast!" exclaimed Toaster. "It's better than the first."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't think--" Mary Frances started.</p>
<p>"I know!" snapped the little man. "Don't contradict me about toast! By the way," he asked, "why don't you make it into Milk Toast for your mother? it would be softer, and more palat--palat--"</p>
<p>"Pal-a-table," said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"A piece of toast?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No," he exclaimed in-dig-nant-ly, "a long word always makes me choke. That's why I seldom use them. Now, please read about Milk Toast."</p>
<p>"If you know--" sug-gest-ed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"Well, it's more like real grown-up people to have it out of a book," said the little man. "Go on!"</p>
<p>And Mary Frances read from her little Cook Book.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" size="smaller"><p>No. 3.--MILK TOAST.
<list align="center">
<item>1 tablespoon <ingredient>butter</ingredient></item>
<item>1 tablespoon <ingredient>flour</ingredient></item>
<item>1 cup <ingredient>milk</ingredient></item>
<item>1/4 teaspoon <ingredient>salt</ingredient></item>
<item>3 slices <ingredient>toast</ingredient></item></list></p>
<p><list>
<item>1. Make ready the toast.</item>
<item>2. Heat the milk until smoking hot.</item>
<item>3. Melt the butter in a small saucepan.</item>
<item>4. Throw the flour into the butter. Cook until it bubbles a little, stirring all the time. Take from the fire.</item>
<item>5. Pour 1/3 milk upon the butter and flour, a little at a time, stirring with the back of a spoon to press out the lumps.</item>
<item>6. Place over fire, and gradually stir in the remaining milk.</item>
<illustration><caption>Cup of milk.</caption><description>An illustration of two milk bottles.</description></illustration>

<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=mary&#38;PageNum=29"/>
<item>7. Add the salt. Let boil a minute.</item>
<item>8. Put slices of toast in a heated dish; pour the sauce over and serve hot.</item></list></p></recipe>
<p size="smaller">All measures are made level with the top of cup or spoon. To measure level spoonful:
<list>
<item>Fill spoon heaping full, and level it off with the back of a knife.</item>
<item>For half spoonful, cut through lengthwise.</item>
<item>For quarter spoonful, divide a half spoonful across.</item>
<item>A saltspoon is 1/3 teaspoon.</item></list></p>
<p>"That's right!" said Toaster Man. "That's the way my grandmother made it. If I were you, I'd make only half of that sauce for only two slices of toast. You did so well with the Plain Toast; you go right ahead with the Milk Toast, and see if you can make it all yourself, and if you need any help, I'll be on the spot in a twinkle. Follow carefully what your little Cook Book says. You know you must measure everything even with the top of the spoon, or cup."</p>
<p>So Mary Frances did exactly what the recipe told her.</p>
<p>As she poured the last of the sauce over the toast, which she had put in a pretty dish, the little man, who had been running here and there, watching everything

she did, shouted, "Hurrah!" At least, he tried to shout, but his voice would scarcely reach to a grown-up person's ear. "You are the best pupil I ever had!"</p>
<p>"Have you had many?" asked Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"You are the only one," said Toaster. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"I should think," said the little man, standing on his toes, to look over the edge of the dish, "that that Milk Toast would taste awful good!"</p>
<p>"Won't you try it?" asked Mary Frances. She was very much afraid he would, but she wanted to show her gratitude for his kindness.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," sighed the little man, "I never eat."</p>
<p>"You never eat!" exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"It may seem strange to you," said the little man, "but everything that is put into my head falls out backwards, and I simply can't eat."</p>
<p>"It must be dreadful!" said Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"It keeps me very thin," complained Toaster, "but if I'm not mistaken, your mother will eat all that toast,--if she gets it while it's hot."</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope so," said Mary Frances; "and I thank you so very very much."</p>

<p>MARY FRANCES pushed open the door of her mother's room very softly.</p>

<p>"It's the best toast I ever ate," said her mother, "and Mary Frances, dear, I feel much better already."</p>
<p>She would have said more had not Mary Frances' brother bounded up the stairs two steps at a time with,--</p>
<p>"What do you think! I met Father downtown, and he says Aunt Maria's coming over to keep house for us. In the daytime, she must be at home; but she'll come over to get breakfast for us, and we'll go there for our dinners--and Father says Mother is going to the seashore to have a 'perfect rest' until she's well. Anyhow, I'm glad we won't starve. I wish Sis knew how to cook!" and he teasingly pulled one of Mary Frances' curls.</p>
<p>"Hush, Brother!" said the mother, "you should have been here to see the lovely Milk Toast Sister just brought me. It was the best I ever ate--and she made it all herself."</p>

<p>TO the kitchen door she ran, and was about to rush out, when she thought she heard voices--thin, little voices they were--so she peeped out, for the door was ajar,--and this is what she saw:</p>
<p>Toaster Man, all tired out, was leaning back in a chair, snoring softly; but all the other Kitchen People were wide awake. It was Tea Kettle that was speaking:</p>
<p>"So, he put the eight feathers in a pan, and cooked them--"</p>

<p>"The Jack Rabbit--and then he ate their fringe all off, and gave the bones to the cat. Then he bragged--he bragged that he'd eaten eight whole chickens at once."</p>

thought Mary Frances, "but I must warn them about Aunt Maria"; and she hurried out into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Listen!" she whispered, with upraised finger. "Listen!--Mother is going away, and Aunt Maria's coming over to keep house. Don't ever say a word--she'll never understand you, and she'll scrub and scour you till you ache, poor things!--she'll do that anyway, but don't talk before her. I hurried down to warn you--I was so afraid you might."</p>
<p>"Never fear," spoke up Tea Kettle; "we never, never talk before 'grown-ups'--we can't help them. I forgot to tell you--if you speak about us to anyone, we can never, never speak again."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll take a look at that fire, myself," Aunt Maria continued, as she started toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>"He'll never eat a hundred!"</p>
<p>Mary Frances looked around. <implement>Boiler Pan</implement> was climbing down from the closet shelf.</p>
<p>"Hello! How do you know?" asked Mary Frances. "You never saw him eat."</p>
<p>"Hear that! Hear that!" cried <implement>Boiler Pan.</implement> "As though I hadn't cooked potatoes before you were born.

Eat a hundred? Why, I can't hold a hundred--so there!"</p>
<p>"Ho, ho!" said Mary Frances, "that must be so How many can you hold?"</p>
<p>"Oh, about thirty, I guess," swelling with pride.</p>
<p>"Well," said Mary Frances, "you've no notion how many that boy can eat, and there isn't much else for lunch. I guess I'll cook about twelve,"--and counting them out, she began to wash them.</p>
<p>"Be sure to get all the sand out of their eyes, laughed <implement>Boiler Pan.</implement> "But first, will you help me jump up on the stove, and fill me?--then I can boil while you're 'ringing' the potatoes."</p>
<p>This done, he was very quiet, while she finished the potatoes.</p>
<p>Just then the clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>"Why, I must hurry," exclaimed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," bubbled <implement>Boiler Pan.</implement></p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I'm coming," and she dropped the potatoes in one by one.</p>
<p>"Now, put on my hat," said <implement>Boiler Pan,</implement> and Mary Frances put on the lid.</p>
<p>"Are they all right?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"All right!" he answered in a muffled voice.</p>
<p>Mary Frances then went in the dining-room, and busied herself about setting the table.</p>
<p>Soon, she heard a "rumpus" in the kitchen. She ran out. Bubbles were sputtering over the sides of <implement>Boiler Pan,</implement> and the lid was dancing a jig.</p>
<p>"What shall I do? What shall I do?" cried Mary Frances, jumping up and down.</p>
<p>"This hat's crazy! Take it off, quick!" <implement>Boiler Pan</implement> besought her.</p>
<p>Without thinking, she seized the lid with her fingers, but dropped it with a cry of pain.</p>
<p>"I'm scalded, I'm scalded," she sobbed. "What will I do for it?" and she ran for some cold water.</p>
<p>"Don't do that, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin. "Butter it and then powder it with baking soda the way your mother does."</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry," said <implement>Boiler Pan,</implement> "but I really couldn't get my old hat off. I should have told you to take a holder."</p>
<p>"Never mind, it's better now. Those potatoes must be done. Yes," as she tried them with a fork, "even

the biggest is done in the middle. I'm so glad, for I expect that boy any minute."</p>
<p>"So'm I," said <implement>Boiler Pan,</implement> "for I feel the effect of this stren-u-os-i-ty."</p>
<p>Mary Frances pretended not to notice this speech, but carefully drained the water from the potatoes, and shook <implement>Boiler Pan</implement> over the fire to dry them off.</p>
<p>"I--I--learned--that--that--wor--word--after year--years--of--stud--study," he said between the shakes, "and you--nev--never--notic--noticed--"</p>
<p>But Billy was knocking.</p>
<p>So Mary Frances, hastily putting <implement>Boiler Pan</implement> on the back of the stove, ran to let him in.</p>
<p>"Hello, Sister! Here we are! Lunch ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes, all ready. I'll put it on. You sit in Father's place, and we'll play we're grown up."</p>
<p>"Scrumptious!" exclaimed Billy, as Mary Frances set the smoking dish of potatoes on the table.</p>
<p>"What an excellent cook you must have, Madam," he said, after his first taste. "Such good potatoes!"</p>
<p>"I have ten," said Mary Frances.</p>

Billy, for all the world as though he were a grown-up young gentleman. "How quiet they keep."</p>
<p>"Yes," laughed Mary Frances, "but they're 'most always busy," and she held up her ten pink little fingers.</p>
<p>"Oh, Billy," she added earnestly, "I'm so glad you like them--the potatoes, I mean. There is only one left--won't you have that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, let's give that to Jubey--Jubey might be hurt if you didn't let her try them. I would,--if I were Jubey."</p>

<p>"GOOD morning, Kitchen People," said Mary Frances, after breakfast next day, "this is a very important morning with me."</p>
<p>The Kitchen People looked pleased and important, too.</p>
<p>"You see, it's this way," she continued as she took her little book and sat in the rocking chair. "I am very anxious to get through every recipe in my cook book before Mother comes home, so I guess we'll just finish all the potato recipes to-day,--and give Billy a Potato Lunch! Won't that be fine?"</p>
<p>The Kitchen People all smiled in approval.</p>
<p>She went to the window.</p>
<p>"O--h, Billy! Billy!" she called; "you're invited to a Potato Lunch in our dining-room at twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>"All right, I'll be on time," answered Billy from the garden.</p>

more recipes--about two potatoes each. Four times two,--eight."</p>
<p>She washed the potatoes carefully, and had no sooner set about paring them, than the kitchen door opened, and in walked Aunt Maria.</p>
<p>"What in the world is that child doing? Paring potatoes? Did I ever!--Such thin, close parings, too! How well she does it!--But you must drop them into cold water as soon as they are pared, child. I wish I could stay and show you how to cook, but duty calls me--I must be going!"</p>
<p>Mary Frances stepped to the door with her.</p>
<p>"When I was your age, child, I could cook 'most everything and piece patch-work for quilts,"--and she kept Mary Frances on the porch ten minutes, telling her that little girls weren't brought up any more to be useful the way they were when she was a little girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lid!" sang Tea Kettle, as Mary Frances stepped back into the kitchen. "Oh, my aunt!--has the old lady went?"</p>
<p>"Gone!" said Big Iron Pot from the back of the stove.</p>

<p>"I dare," sputtered Iron Pot. "I dare,--and I dare tell you other things, too!"</p>
<p>"You do, do you?" bubbled Tea Kettle. "You do! Well, what do you dare tell me?"</p>
<p>"I dare tell you, Mister," said Iron Pot, "that you've got a dirty face--yes, a black face."</p>
<p>Tea Kettle, it was plain to be seen, was boiling mad. Steam blew out of his nose in every direction.</p>
<p>Now, everybody who knows anything about a tea kettle can imagine how very angry Tea Kettle was.</p>
<p>As soon as he could get his breath, he blew steam all over Iron Pot.</p>
<p>"My face is black, is it? Well, yours is black,--and it will soon be black and blue!"</p>
<p>"You swallow them words!" and Iron Pot raised his queer little fists.</p>
<p>"Sput!" mocked Tea Kettle, getting ready to spout again. "Take that!"</p>
<p>Wang! came down the little fist,--but not on the lid of Tea Kettle. Oh, no; for just as that was going to happen, Mary Frances lifted him high in the air.</p>

<p>"Let go of me! Let me at Iron Pot!" He was at white heat.</p>
<p>"Be quiet!" said Mary Frances, shaking him quite hard. "What's all this about?"</p>
<p>"Iron Pot commenced it!" sullenly simmered Tea Kettle. "Iron Pot called me names!"</p>
<p>"Why," said Mary Frances, "this is disgraceful! Now, you sit there!" She put Tea Kettle on the front of the stove.</p>
<p>"And you, there!" She pulled Big Iron Pot as far back as she could.</p>
<p>"Now, behave yourselves!"</p>
<p>Then she sat down to rest.</p>
<p>"What makes them quarrel so, I wonder," Mary Frances said half to herself. "All the Kitchen People seem so kind and helpful."</p>
<p>"Why, don't you know, child?" asked Aunty Rolling Pin. "I thought everybody knew that story."</p>
<p>A story! Mary Frances was always ready to listen to a story.</p>
<p>"Won't you tell me, please?"</p>

back an inch or two to a more comfortable place on the table.</p>
<p>"You see, it's this way, child," she began.</p>
<p>"In the days of your great-grandmother there were no stoves, only open fireplaces were used for cooking,--and kettles were just as black then as that old black Pot there.</p>
<p>"So, when the Pot called the Kettle black, the Kettle said:</p>
<p>"'Black yourself!' and no harm was done.</p>
<p>"But when your mother got that fine new cook stove, she bought that bright, shiny Kettle, too.</p>
<p>"But that silly old Pot doesn't know that the new Kettle is bright and shiny, so it keeps on calling names. That Pot doesn't know it's fooling itself,--for all it sees is its own homely old black self in the shiny Kettle making faces.</p>
<p>"And that's what comes of calling names, child," chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin, as she ended her story.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Tea Kettle puffed steam importantly, and clapped his little lid.</p>
<p>Nothing more was said in the kitchen for several seconds.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" at length said Mary Frances gratefully to Aunty Rolling Pin.</p>
<p>Then she added, very firmly and gently to Iron Pot and Tea Kettle:</p>
<p>"I want you to promise me never to call names again, either one of you, for it makes me feel so sad.</p>
<p>"Do you promise?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I promise," brightly answered Tea Kettle.</p>
<p>"I pro-promise," solemnly declared Big Iron Pot.</p>

<hd align="center" size="smaller">MARY FRANCES GETS BREAKFAST</hd>
<p>MARY FRANCES was a long time getting to sleep that night for thinking about breakfast.</p>
<p>She had her little cook book, and Mother's last letter under her pillow.</p>
<p>"Billy writes your lunches are 'scrumptious,'" ran her mother's letter. "I cannot tell how much comfort my little girl is to me."</p>
<p>"I've 'most a mind to tell Mother about the cook book," thought Mary Frances, "but won't she open her eyes when I tell her I've made everything--if I can keep the secret! I do hope I wake up in time. Father said he'd call me to breakfast, when he said "Good-night,' but I want to slip down, and have everything ready when he comes."</p>
<p>So she fell asleep, and dreamed she made an Angel Cake as big as a mountain, and that Jubey stole it, and fed all the hungry cats in the world.</p>
<p>She had fixed the curtain so that the first sunlight

would fall on her face, and it seemed only a breath of time until she felt it call her.</p>
<p>How sleepy she was!</p>
<p>"I'll get down before the Kitchen Folks are awake," she whispered.</p>
<p>She carried her little shoes in her hand, and stole softly downstairs, stopping in the dining-room to put them on.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, you!" she recognized the voice of Tea Kettle.</p>
<p>"Just wait till I read it out of my little book," mimicked a new voice.</p>
<p>"For shame, you saucy Pan!" exclaimed Big Iron Pot.</p>
<p>"Just wait until I read it!"</p>
<p>Mary Frances peeped into the kitchen. In the middle of the floor stood little Sauce Pan, pretending to read out of a book:</p>
<p>"'How to Make Potato Pie Out of Sauer-kraut.'"</p>
<p>"Silly!" exclaimed <implement>Potato Masher.</implement></p>
 <p>Sauce Pan repeated:</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose>"To Make Potato Pie Out of Sauer-kraut:</purpose></p>
<p>"1. Fill eight <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> with <ingredient>Sauer-kraut,</ingredient> and peel them.</p>

<p>"2. Make a crust of the left-overs.</p>
<p>"3. Bake the parings well, and serve very hot on <ingredient>ice.</ingredient>"</p></recipe>
<p>Just then Mary Frances sneezed.</p>
 <p>How Sauce Pan ran, and jumped up to his place on the rack!</p>
<p>He looked so shamefaced when Mary Frances went in, that she hadn't the heart to scold him.</p>
<p>Instead, "Boiled Eggs," she called.</p>
 <p>He pretended to be asleep. Then she took him by the arm and shook him.</p>
<p>"Boiled Eggs!" she shouted. "Doesn't that mean you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," he said meekly; "I'm such a 'sleepy-head!' Do you know," con-fi-den-ti-al-ly, "I often talk in my sleep." At this the Kitchen People grinned.</p>
<p>"Ahem!" said Mary Frances, "It's a dangerous habit. Sometimes people tell stories when they're awake, too," she added as she stepped out to get the milk.</p>
<p>"Is 'Old Puff-away' ready?" asked Sauce Pan of <implement>Coffee Pot.</implement></p>
<p>"If you mean Tea Kettle, Saucy," answered Coffee

Pot excitedly, "I hope so, for I can scarcely wait till I'm needed."</p>
<p>Tea Kettle gave two extra puffs of steam, but otherwise took no notice.</p>
<p>"How do you know you'll be used?" Sauce Pan asked of <implement>Coffee Pot,</implement> nudging <implement>Pie Plate</implement> who was near him.</p>
<p>"I come next in the book--and, besides, I'm always used for breakfast." <implement>Coffee Pot</implement> was beginning to get angry.</p>
<p>"Bet we have eggs,--eggs, and toast, and--<emph rend="italic">tea!</emph> Yes, I bet it's <emph rend="italic">tea</emph> for B. this morning."</p>
<p>Sauce Pan kept on saying, "Tea for B." so long that <implement>Coffee Pot</implement> began to cry:</p>
<p align="indent2">"Eggs and toast and tea,<lb/>
That doesn't mean me.<lb/>
Coffee is better--<lb/>
Though not wetter--<lb/>
For breakfast<lb/>
Than tea, tea, tea."</p>
<p>"Tee-hee--Tee-hee--Tee-hee!" giggled Sauce Pan, pointing to <implement>Coffee Pot</implement> tan-ta-liz-ing-ly, who began to cry in earnest.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with <implement>Coffee Pot?</implement>" Mary Frances asked when she came in. "Is it possible Aunt Maria forgot to dry you last night?"</p>
<p>Nobody said anything--and Sauce Pan hastily ran toward the stove.</p>
<p>"Wait," called Mary Frances, "wait a minute until I can look in my book--"</p>
<p>"Oh, I can say it without any book--we all know our own tricks," boasted Sauce Pan.</p>
<p>"All right," said Mary Frances, "say it--that will save time."</p>
<p>So he began.</p>
<p>"B'iled eggs--excuse me!--boiled eggs," he corrected, seeing Mary Frances' stern face.</p>

her what 'accordin' meant, and she said 'accordin' to the tastes of them that eats them--soft or hard."</p>
<p>"I was speaking of the best way," declared Sauce Pan glancing loftily at Mary Frances. "There is no end of ways to do it, but this is the scientific way to cook eggs so that they will be soft, but cooked all the way through and easily digested--not liquid inside a hard, white coat.

<p>After she had followed his directions entirely, she made the toast.</p>
<p>Toaster Man was so sleepy, he didn't say a word except, "You'll do it right, I know," and fell asleep again.</p>

<p>"I must stop," she'd say to herself--and the more she'd say it, the more she'd laugh. "This is dreadful, Mary Frances," she'd scold herself; "but, oh, my, wasn't it funny!"--and away she'd go again.</p>

<p>"Like the old country!" thought Mary Frances. "That's the funniest way for anything to taste I ever heard of. Maybe he's so hungry he's a little bit out of his head. Oh, I know what I'll do! I'll make an omelet for him! I don't believe he's eaten omelet since--maybe, since he was as little as I am--maybe a hundred years. He looks a hundred years old, I'm sure.

<p>MARY FRANCES listened at the kitchen door before going in next morning. She wanted to find out what the Kitchen People might be doing.</p>
<p>"It isn't exactly eavesdropping," she thought, "although it seems awfully near to it."</p>
<p>"Can't you find it?" somebody was asking.</p>

<p>"Well, Nosey," answered <implement>Coffee Pot,</implement> "suppose you try--your nose is long enough to poke into anything!"</p>
<p>"So much the better for me this time, Pug Nose."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tea Pot rather breathlessly. (It seemed to Mary Frances as if he were lifting a heavy weight.) "Yes, here is the place. Somebody else read; I'm too tired."</p>

<p>"Now, dears," Mary Frances smiled upon them, "no wonder you look surprised; for that's a grand invitation, all written out on real paper. I had an awful time getting it to sound right. I'm not sure that it is just exactly correct yet. So we'll get dressed right away. Now don't all ask at once what you'll wear. Yes, Fonsey, of course you'll wear your dress suit. What of it if it isn't proper to wear it until after six o'clock? You have only your work clothes and that suit and you'll have to wear your best."</p>
<p>Everybody was quiet and good as gold while Mary Frances finished dressing them.</p>
<p>"There," she said to herself, "the last sash is tied. Goodness, I'm tired--tired-er than if I'd been cooking the whole morning! Aren't dolls stupid compared with Kitchen Folks? I do wonder what the Kitchen Folks will do. Will they talk before them?</p>
<p>"Now, you, dolls, be good, and take a nap," she warned, "so that you won't be sleepy at the party. I must go and get ready."</p>

<p>She couldn't seem to keep still, but kept rolling to and fro, watching Mary Frances' every motion.</p>
<p>"Well, Aunty Rolling Pin?" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"Ever make any biscuits, child?"</p>
<p>"No, Aunty Rolling Pin, but I believe I can with your help, if you'll be so kind."</p>
<p>"'Deed I will, child." Aunty Rolling Pin gave a delighted chuckle. "I've been waiting patiently for the chance."</p>
<p>"I'm going to give a Dolls' Kitchen Party, Aunty."</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm glad you told me, child; that makes everything more important than ever. So, as you gather together the things you'll need, you can listen--ahem!--to Aunty Rolling Pin's wisdom."</p>
<p>"You know about 'most everything!" said Mary Frances. "I'd be much obliged to you for any other hints during the rest of my lessons."</p>
<p>"I'll be glad to help, child," said Aunty.</p>

<p>"Mother expected to explain everything to me, you see--"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, child," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin, seeing Mary Frances looked sad; "but I see you have sifted the flour and baking powder and salt into a bowl and poured it back. Instead of using a bowl, it's a good idea to use a piece of heavy paper. When this is folded funnel-like, the flour can readily be poured into the <implement>sifter</implement> again and again."</p>
<p>"That certainly is easier," said Mary Frances, putting the hint to practice.</p>
<p>"In order to get the baking powder into every bit of the flour, they should be sifted together three times. Now, I see you are working the butter into the flour. Rub lightly with your finger tips. That's it--pour the milk gradually, mix well--the dough should be almost sticky, but not too soft to handle. Now it's my turn," she chuckled, as Mary Frances turned the dough on a well-floured board. "But if you are going to make Thimble Biscuits, one half of the dough is enough to pat out for them--"</p>
<p>"And I can make the rest into real biscuits! What a splendid idea!" said Mary Frances.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the handles are her ears," she thought, softly patting the dough with Aunty Rolling Pin.</p>
<p>As she bent over, she caught the sound of singing, and this is the song Aunty Rolling Pin sang:</p>
<p align="center">"Roly-poly, roly-poly,<lb/>

<p>"Where?" she asked suddenly stopping.</p>
<p>Mary Frances jumped. She had been rolling Aunty Rolling Pin to and fro, unconsciously keeping time with her song.</p>
<p>"Where?" she again demanded, her mouth full of flour.</p>
<p>"Dear me," answered Mary Frances, "I don't know."</p>
<p>"School, of course," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin; "I thought you'd surely know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," laughed Mary Frances; "Cooking School."</p>
<p>"Certainly, child," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin. "To what other school could you go to learn about me?"</p>
<p>"That's beautiful poetry," said Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"I think so," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin; "I made it up myself. It's so <emph rend="italic">floury</emph>, you know," blowing the white dust in the air.</p>
<p>"Tee-hee," giggled Mary Frances.</p>
<p>Aunty Rolling Pin looked offended.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said Mary Frances, "you mean 'flowery.'"</p>
<p>"I mean what I say," said Aunty Rolling Pin; "isn't that what I said?"</p>
<p>As it certainly was what she said, and Mary Frances didn't like to explain, she hastily turned to her work.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to cut the biscuits, as she had often helped her mother in baking. She knew how to dip the cutter each time into flour, that the dough might not stick. She used the large thimble she had brought down from the sewing room in the same way as she had used the <implement>biscuit cutter.</implement></p>

<p>"Well," said Mary Frances, "you see, it's like this:</p>

<p>"No," answered Mary Frances, seriously, "but I meant she does such funny things: Last summer, she told Elvin Phelps if he didn't keep his bees from stealing honey out of her flowers, she'd shoot them--she (oh, dear!)--wanted--him--to tie each one--by his hind leg--to keep--them--home--oh, dear," laughed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"What did he do?" asked Aunty Rolling Pin, anxiously.</p>
<p>"He told her (excuse my laughing--but it's so funny!) he would rather--put a 'No Trespassing' sign up in her garden for them to read! Ho-ho! Tee-hee." Mary Frances shook with laughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Iron Pot, importantly climbing from the shelf, and eying critically the piece of meat Mary Frances had placed on the table.</p>
<p>"That's a pretty nice cut of meat--pretty nice. It will be all right to cook it as I will tell you. But, really, mutton is less greasy if it is boiled long enough before needed to let the gravy cool. Take off the cake of fat which will form on the top when cold. Of course, take the meat out as soon as it is tender, and after 'skimming' the gravy, put it in again to re-heat."</p>
<p>"I haven't time!" said Mary Frances, anxiously.</p>
<p>"You can put yours in a bowl, and stand the bowl in ice water to cool the liquor quickly, and do the same thing that way, now--"</p>

<p>"No, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin, smiling; "but perhaps you have learned by this time pretty nearly well enough to do an easy lesson without our help. We can't talk before other people, you know. Perhaps the little girl's own Kitchen People will help her some time."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a very easy lesson, I think.--'Apple Snow,' she added. And 'a promise 's a promise!'"</p>
<p>"Yes," interrupted Sauce Pan, "you can get along nicely with that recipe."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I can," said Mary Frances, happily. "I'll go over for Eleanor now."</p>

Frances' mother had written in the recipe. The Kitchen People watched out of the corners of their eyes, but never said a word.</p>
<p>"Oh, isn't this good," sighed Eleanor, eating the light, delicious dessert. Then, "Mary Frances, I know; I'm going to ask my mother for a cook book! I wonder if you'll let me borrow yours some time to show her."</p>
<p>"Of course!" laughed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>Just then there was a ring at the door-bell.</p>
<p>In came Aunt Maria with a mysterious looking bundle.</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, you have company, I see," said the old lady with a smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Eleanor, "Mary Frances has been giving me a cooking lesson."</p>
<p>Mary Frances shook her head and put her finger to her mouth, but Eleanor didn't understand.</p>
<p>"A cooking lesson!" exclaimed Aunt Maria. "A cooking lesson! Mary Frances! A cooking lesson!"</p>
<p>Then she began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Mary Frances, dear," she said, at length, "I heard about the lovely things you made Mary Ann Hooper; and I found out, too, by wheedlin' it out of her, about the cooking lessons--and here's a surprise for you," and she handed the bundle to the little girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria!" cried Mary Frances unwrapping it. "Look, Eleanor!--a little cap and apron!"</p>
<p>"To wear at your cooking lessons," fluttered Aunt Maria.</p>
<p>"How dear and lovely! (Trying them on.) "Look, Eleanor, they just fit!"</p>
<p>"You're the happiest girl in the world!" sighed Eleanor.</p>
<p>"I should be, if Mother were really well," said Mary Frances; "but she's much better, and is coming home soon. Aunt Maria," she added,--"oh, I want you to share the secret! I'm doing all the lessons she had written out for me in my cook book--to surprise her when she comes home!'</p>
<p>"Good!" said Aunt Maria. "I'll tell you!--you can get dinner ready the day she comes!"</p>

<p>Then, suddenly thinking,--</p>
<p>"Oh, Aunt Maria, excuse me, please! Won't you have some of our lesson?--Some of the Apple Snow we made for our lesson, I mean?"</p>
<p>"I'd ap-pre-ci-ate the kindness," said the old lady a little stiffly, as though a bit ashamed of her softness a moment ago. But after tasting the treat, she said:</p>
<p>"It's the most beautiful snow I ever saw, little girls,--even more beautiful than that on which I, so many years ago, used to pull a sled.</p>

<hd align="center" size="smaller">THE TEA PARTY</hd>
<p>MARY FRANCES didn't eat much lunch.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, child?" asked Aunt Maria, anxiously. "'Homesick' for Mother?--or was to-day's lesson too hard?"</p>
<p>Then Mary Frances told of cutting and eating the fresh cake. "And, Aunt Maria," she said, the tears flowing down her cheeks, "it went down!</p>
<p align="right">down!&#32; &#32; &#32; &#32; &#32;</p>
<p align="right">down!</p>
<p>until I was afraid it would rise out of the bottom of the pan the other way."</p>
<p>"Never mind, dear child," Aunt Maria comforted her. "I did the same thing to my first cake. I remember it well!"</p>
<p>"You did, Aunt Maria?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the old lady. "I'll tell you what we'll do! I'll bake a cake in place of yours for to-night's party. Don't tell any one."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Aunt Maria," cried Mary Frances; "that's so kind!"</p>
<p>"Not a word to any one!" cau-tion-ed Aunt Maria. "What else do you have?"</p>
<p>"Cocoa," said Mary Frances; "I can make that."</p>
<p>"My," smiled Aunt Maria, "I'm so proud."</p>
<p align="center">*&#32; &#32; &#32;*&#32; &#32; &#32;*&#32; &#32; &#32;*&#32; &#32; &#32;*&#32; &#32; &#32;*&#32; &#32; &#32;*</p>
<p>After the games and riddles, Mary Frances excused herself from her guests, and made the cocoa and the pot of tea for her aunt. Then Billy carried in the tray, on which she had placed the cake, and the cups and saucers, plates, napkins, and <implement>Chocolate Pot,</implement> and, oh, yes, Tea Pot, for Aunt Maria; and she poured the cocoa like a real grown lady, while the boys passed the plates and the cake, and served the guests to the cups of cocoa.</p>
<p>"Did Mary Frances make this cake?" asked one of the guests. ("I'm awfully glad she didn't ask about the other," thought the little girl.)</p>
<p>"Yes," said Eleanor's brother Bob. "Yes; knowing the greatness of the present oc-ca-sion, I have written a poem, en-ti-tled, 'Ode to the Cook' (bowing to Mary Frances), which, with your kind indulgence, I will now read:"</p>

<p>"Begin!" laughed Mary Frances.</p>
<p>Bob cleared his throat and began:</p>
<p align="center">"Mary Frances is a girl<lb/>
Who cooks for you and I;<lb/>
She can boil a fancy cake<lb/>
Or stew a cherry pie.</p>
<p align="center">"Once she made a pot of soup<lb/>
And served it for our dinner;<lb/>
We thought that we were like to die,<lb/>
It made us so much thinner."</p>
<p>"Time to weep?" asked Billy, pa-thet-i-cal-ly.</p>
<p align="center">"Now, this, our cook will save expense,<lb/>
For when she is your baker,<lb/>
You may save your doctor's bill--<lb/>
Just get an undertaker."</p>
<p>"Now, Billy," cried Mary Frances, "what have you been telling?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Bob, I say--" said Billy.</p>
<p>"Mary Frances, don't mind Bob," interrupted

Eleanor. "You see what I have to stand all the time." And Mary Frances laughed heartily.</p>
<p>"Did you think I minded Bob?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Show you forgive me, Mary Frances," begged Bob, "by letting me have another cup of cake, and another piece of cocoa."</p>
<p>"Not <emph rend="italic">another</emph>," laughingly corrected Mary Frances. "To be polite, I believe I must pretend I didn't notice you'd had any."</p>
<p>"You certainly are kind, Mary Frances," said Bob, "when I don't know how many pieces--"</p>
<p>"I know," cried Eleanor,--"this makes the fifth!"</p>
<p>"Well, Nell," begged Bob, "don't tell Mother."</p>
<p>"You deserve it," said Eleanor.</p>
<p>"Come," said Billy, "all ready! another game! 'Blind feeds Blind!'" And they blindfolded the boys' eyes, and sat them opposite each other, each with a plate of little pieces of cake, and a spoon. They were to try to feed each other. The one who dropped the least number of pieces, and whose cake was first gone, won. It was very funny! Sometimes the spoon was poked into the other boy's ear; sometimes it hit his nose.</p>

<p>"Everything was grand, Mary Frances," said Eleanor, "and it was the loveliest party!"</p>
<p>"I think so, too," smiled Aunt Maria.</p>
<p>"One last riddle," said Mary Frances' father, bidding the young people good-night:</p>
<p>"'Why is Mary Frances the happiest girl in the world?'"</p>
<p>Then they all guessed--</p>
<p>"Because 'Mother' is coming home to-morrow!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mary Frances," laughed Eleanor, "I've had more fun! Good-night, dear." And "So have we all of us," and "Thank you," cried the others.</p>

<p>"That's it!" exclaimed Aunty Rolling Pin, joyously. "I was afraid there might not be 'shortening' or lard enough in the recipe. The whole art of making good pastry is in having one-third as much lard as flour, and using as little water as possible.</p>
<p>"I was afraid, too, that your mother would not put 'pastry' in the book, for when flour or starch grains are coated in fat they are too dry to 'swell' well in cooking, and cannot burst open. They are not, I'm sorry to say, a very di-ges-ti-ble food."</p>
<p>"I'm glad she did, though," said Mary Frances; "she will not often let us eat 'pastry,' but I 'spect she im-ag-ined how pleased I'd be. I wonder why pie tastes so good, if it isn't good for us? My, how much I have to do! Now I'm ready!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said <implement>Baking Dish,</implement> "that is very nice; but if you use the yolk of the egg in the pudding, it will save it, and make the pudding better."</p>
<p>"To save a yolk, all you have to do (it was little <implement>Egg Beater</implement>) is to drop it into a cup and pour a little cold water over the top, to prevent its drying. You can use it next day, if you keep it cool."</p>

<p>Whenever she'd make a mistake, some one of the Kitchen People would correct and help her.</p>
<p>At six o'clock all the dinner was ready to serve, and the table was set.</p>

<p>AFTER one last look, Mary Frances, hearing the sound of carriage wheels, ran to answer the door before the bell rang; but Billy was there, too, and they opened the door together.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother!" cried Mary Frances; "you dear, darling Mother! What a 'cry-baby' I am!" (as the tears rolled down her cheeks, and Mother kissed her and Billy and Father again and again) "What a 'cry-baby!'"</p>
<p>"Which she is not!" declared Billy. "Tell Mother,--Mary Frances, I can't wait for you to tell your secret!"</p>
<p>"A secret?" smiled Mother. "A secret, Mary Frances?"</p>
<p>"Oh, how good something smells!" said Mother. "It makes me hungry."</p>
<p>"Come right out, then," said Mary Frances, bowing, "Dinner is Served."</p>

<p>"Here?" asked her mother. "I im-ag-ined we'd go over to Aunt Maria's."</p>
<p>"No, Mother, dear," laughed Mary Frances, happily; "it's the 'surprise' for you." And they went into the dining-room.</p>
<p>"Wh--wh--why! how did this happen?" asked Mother. "Where did this feast come from?"</p>
<p>Everybody laughed and talked at the same time.</p>
<p>"Mary Frances is guilty," laughed Billy; and Mary Frances "owned up."</p>
<p>"Mother," said she, bringing her worn and somewhat soiled little cook book and putting it in her Mother's lap, "I've made everything! I've gone 'all through' my book! I got dinner to-night!--that's your surprise."</p>
<p>"My own dear, lovely child!" said Mother. "You dear, precious baby-woman!" And taking Mary Frances in her lap, she hugged and kissed her again and again.</p>

hadn't been for you, I never, never could have done it,--my dear, dear, friends."</p>
<p>"You'll not need us soon again," said Tea Kettle, sadly. "We're sorry--yet we're glad that your mother will take our place as teacher now."</p>
<p>"Will you help me when I do need you?" asked Mary Frances.</p>
<p>"When you do," they promised, and she threw them a kiss.</p>
<p>"Good-night, little Miss," they cried; and when she turned round again, they looked just like any or-din-ary kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>For a minute she felt very lonely; then, remembering, she said gladly, "But they promised!"</p>
