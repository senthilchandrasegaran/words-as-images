<illustration><description>An illustration of a tree with few leaves and many branches. On the trunk is a mailbox.</description>
</illustration><p>ONE morning in early spring, John Landis, a Pennsylvania German farmer living in Schuggenhaus Township, Bucks County, on opening his mail box, fastened to a tree at the cross-roads (for the convenience of rural mail carriers) found one letter for his wife Sarah, the envelop addressed in the well-known handwriting of her favorite niece. Mary Middleton, of Philadelphia.</p><p>A letter being quite an event at "Clear Spring" farm, he hastened with it to the house, finding "Aunt Sarah," as she was railed by every one (Great Aunt to Mary), in the cheery farm house kitchen busily engaged kneading sponge for a loaf of rye bread, which she carefully deposited on a well-floured linen cloth, in a large bowl for the final raising.</p><p>Carefully adjusting her glasses more securely over the bridge of her nose, she turned at the sound of her husband's footsteps. Seeing the letter in his hand she inquired: "What news, John?" Ouickly opening the letter handed her, she. after a hasty perusal, gave one of the whimsical smiles peculiar to her and remarked decisively, with a characteristic nod of her head: "John, Mary Midleton intends to marry, else why, pray tell me, would she write<pb n="010" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=16"/> of giving up teaching her kindergarten class in the city, to spend the summer with us on the farm learning, she writes, to keep house, cook, economize and to learn how to get the most joy and profit from life?"</p><p>"Well, well! Mary is a dear girl, why should she not flunk of marrying?" replied her husband; "she is nineteen. Quite time, I think, she should learn housekeeping--something every young girl should know. We should hear of fewer divorces and a less number of failures of men in business, had their wives been trained before marriage to be good, thrifty, economical housekeepers and, still more important, good homemakers. To be a helpmate in every sense of the word is every woman's duty, I think, when her husband works early and late to procure the means to provide for her comforts and luxuries and a competencying she may, in time, become as capable a housekeeper and as good a cook as her Aunt Sarah; and, to my way of thinking, there is none better, my dear."</p><p>Praise from her usually reticent husband never failed to deepen the tint of pink on Aunt Sarah's still smooth, unwrinkled, youthful-looking face, made more charming by being framed in waves of silvery gray hair, on which the "Hand of Time," in passing, had sprinkled some of the dust from the road of life.</p><p>In size, Sarah Landis was a little below medium height, rather stout, or should I say comfortable, and matronly looking; very erect for a woman of her age. Her bright, expressive, gray eyes twinkled humorously when she talked. She had developed a fine character by her years of unselfish devotion to family and friends. Her splendid sense of humor helped her to overcome difficulties, and her ability to rise above her environment, however discouraging their conditions, prevented her from being unhappy or depressed by the small annoyances met daily. She never failed to find joy and pleasure in the faithful performance of daily tasks, however small or insignificant. Aunt Sarah attributed her remarkably fine, clear complexion, seldom equalled in a woman of her years, to good digestion and excellent health; her love of fresh air, fruit and clear spring water. She usually drank from four to five tumblerfuls of water a day. She never ate to excess and frequently remarked: "I think more people suffer from over-eating than from insufficient food." An advocate of deep breathing, she<pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=17"/><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=18"/>
<illustration><caption>AUNT SARAH</caption><description>A portrait of an older woman dressed in early twentieth century clothing.</description>
</illustration><pb n="011" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=19"/> spent as much of her time as she could spare from household duties in the open air.</p><p>Sarah Landis was not what one would call beautiful, but good and whole-souled looking. To quote her husband : "To me Sarah never looks so sweet and homelike when all 'fussed up' in her best black dress on special occasions, as she does when engaged daily household tasks around home, in her plain, neat, gray calico dress."</p><p>This dress was always covered with a large, spotlessly clean, blue gingham apron of small broken check, and she was very particular about having a certain-sized check. The apron had a patch pocket, which usually contained small twists or little wads of cord, which, like "The Old Ladies in Cranford," she picked up and saved for a possible emergency.</p><p>One of Aunt Sarah's special economies was the saving of twine and paper bags. The latter were always neatly folded, when emptied, and placed in a cretonne bag made for that purpose, hanging in a convenient corner of the kitcken.</p><p>Aunt Sarah's gingham apron was replaced afternoons by one made from fine, Lonsdale cambric, of ample proportions, and on special occasions she donned a hemstitched linen apron, inset at upper edge of hem with crocheted lace insertion, the work of her own deft fingers. Aunt Sarah's aprons, cut straight, on generous lines, were a part of her individuality.</p><p>Sarah Landis declared: "Happiness consists in giving and in serving others," and she lived up to the principles she advocated. She frequently quoted from the "Sons of Martha," by Kipling:</p><p> Lift ye the stone or cleave the wood, to make a path more fair or flat,<lb/>Not as a ladder from earth to heaven, not as an altar to any creed,<lb/>But simple service, simply given, to his own kind in their human need."</p><p>"I think this so fine," said Aunt Sarah, "and so true a sentiment that I am almost compelled to forgive Kipling for paying 'The female of the species is more deadly than the male.'"</p><p>Aunt Sarah's goodness was reflected in her face and in the<pb n="012" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=20"/> tones of her voice, which were soft and low, yet very decided. She possessed a clear, sweet tone, unlike the slow sweet tone, unlike the slow, peculiar drawl often ending with the rising inflection peculiar to many country folk among the "Pennsylvania Germans."</p><p>The secret of Aunt Sarah's charm lay in her goodness. Being always surrounded by a cheery atmosphere, she benefited all with whom she came in contact. She took delight in simple pleasures. She had the power of extracting happiness from the common, little every-day tasks and frequently remarked, "Don't strive to live without work, but to find more joy in your work." Her opinions were highly respected by every one in the neighborhood, and, being possessed of an unselfish disposition, she thought and saw good in every one; brought out the best in one. and made one long to do better, just to gain her approval, if for no higher reward. Sarah Landis was a loyal friend and one would think the following, by Mrs. Craik, applied to her:</p><p>"Oh, the comfort, the inexpressible comfort, of feeling safe with a person--having neither to weigh thoughts nor measure words, but pouring them all right out, just as they are--chaff and grain together, certain that a faithful hand will take and sift them, keep what is worth keeping and then with the breath of kindness blow the rest away." </p><p>She was never so happy as when doing an act of kindness for some poor unfortunate, and often said, "If 'twere not for God and good people, what would become of the unfortunate?" and thought like George McDonald. "If I can put one touch of rosy sunset into the life of any man or woman (I should add child) I shall feel that I have worked with God."</p><p>Aunt Sarah's sweet, lovable face was the first beheld by many a little, new-born infant; her voice, the first to hush its wailing cries as she cuddled it up to her motherly breast and oft with loving hands, softly closed the lids over eyes no longer able to see; whom the Gracious Master had taken into His keeping.</p><p>One day I overheard Aunt Sarah quote to a sorrowing friend these fine, true lines from Longfellow's "Registration" :"Let us be patient, these severe afflictions not from the grounf arise, but oftimes celestial benedictions assume the dark disguise."</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=21"/>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd align="center" placement="heading">CHAPTER II.<lb/><lb/> MARY'S ARRIVAL AT THE FARM</hd><p>The day preceding that of Mary's arrival at the farm was a busy one for Aunt Sarah, who, since early morning, had been preparing the dishes she knew Mary enjoyed. Pans of the whitest flakiest rolls, a large loaf of sweetest nut-brown, freshly-baked "graham bread," of which Mary was especially fond; and array of crumb-cakes and pies of every description covered the well-scrubbed table in the summer kitchen, situated a short distance from the house. A large, yellow earthenware bowl in the table contained a roll of rich, creamy "smier kase" just as it had been turned from the muslin bag, from which the "whey" had dripped over night; ready to be mixed with cream for the supper table. Pats of sweet, freshly-churned butter, buried in clover blossoms, were cooling in the old spring-house near by.</p><p>The farm bouse was guiltless of dust from cellar to attic. Aunt Sarah was a model housekeeper; she accomplished wonders, yet never appeared tired or flurried as less systematic housekeepers often do, who, with greater expenditure of energy, often accomplish less work. She took no unnecessary steps; made each one count, yet never appeared in haste to finish her work.</p><p>Said Aunt Sarah, "The lack of system in housework is what makes it drudgery. If young housekeepers would sit down and plan their work, then do it, they would save time and labor. When using the fire in the range for ironing or other purposes, use the oven for preparing dishes of food which require long, slow cooking, like baked beans, for instance. Bake a cake or a pudding, or a pan of quickly-made corn pone to serve with baked beans, for a hearty meal on a cold winter day. A dish of rice pudding placed in the oven requires very little attention, and when baked may be placed on ice until served. If this rule be followed, the young housewife will be surprised to find how much easier will be the task of preparing a meal later in the day, especially in hot weather.</p><pb n="014" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=24"/><p>The day following, John Landis drove to the railroad station several miles distant, to meet his niece. As Mary stepped from the train into the outstretched arms of her waiting Uncle, many admiring glances followed the fair, young girl. Her tan-gold naturally wavy, masses of hair rivaled ripened grain. The sheen of it resembled corn silk before it has been browned and crinkled by the sun. Her eyes matched in color the exquisite, violet-blue blossoms of the chicory weed. She possessed a rater large mouth, with upturned corners, which seemed made for smiles and when once you had been charmed with them, she had made an easy conquest of you forever. There was a sweet, winning personality about Mary which was as impossible to describe as to resist. One wondered how so much adorable sweetness could be embodied in one small maid. But Mary's sweetness of expression and charming manner covered a strong will and tenacity of purpose one would scarcely have believed possible, did they not have an intimate knowledge of the young girl's disposition. Her laugh, infectious, full of the joy of living, the vitality of youth and perfect health and happiness, reminded one of the lines: "A laugh is just like music for making living sweet."</p><p>Seated beside her Uncle in the carriage, Mary was borne swiftly through the town out into the country. It was one of those preternaturally quiet, sultry days when the whole universe appears lifeless and inert, free from loud noise, or sound of any description, days which we occasionally have in early Spring or Summer, when the stillness is oppressive.</p><p>Frequently at such times there is borne to the nostrils the faint, stifling scent of burning brush, indicating that land is being cleared by the forehanded, thrifty farmer for early planting. Often at such times, before a shower, may be distinctly heard the faintest twitter and "peep, peep" of young sparrows, the harsh "caw, caw" of the crow, and the song of the bobolink, poised on the swaying branch of a tall tree, the happiest bird of spring; the dozy, drowsy hum of bees ; the answering call of lusty young chanticleers, and the satisfied cackle of laying hens and motherly old biddies, surrounded by broods of downy, greedy little newly-hatched chicks. The shrill whistle of a distant locomotive startles one with its clear, resonant intonant, which on a less quiet day would pass unnoticed, which on a less enjoyed to the full the change from the past months of confinement<pb n="015" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=25"/> in a city school, and missed nothing of the beauty of the country and the smell of the good brown earth, as her Uncle drove swiftly homeward.</p><p>"Uncle John," said Mary, "tis easy to believe God made the country."</p><p>"Yes," rejoined her Uncle, "the country is good enough for me."</p><p>"With the exception of the one day in the mouth, when you attend the 'shriners' meeting' in the city," mischievously supplemented Mary, who knew her Uncle's liking for the Masonic Lodge of which he was a member, "and," she continued, "I brought you a picture for your birthday, which we shall celebrate tomorrow. The picture will please you, I know. It is entitled, ' I Love to Love a Mason, 'Cause a Mason Never Tells.'"</p><p>They passed cultivated farms. Inside many of the rail fences, inclosing fields of grain or clover, were planted numberless sour cherry trees, snowy with bloom, the ground underneath white with fallen petals. The air was sweet with the perfume of the half-opened buds on the apple trees in the near-by orchards and rose-like pink blossoms of the "flowering" crab-apple, in the door yards. Swiftly they drove through cool, green, leafy woods, crossing a wooden bridge spanning a small stream, so shallow that the stones at the bottom were plainly to be seen. A loud splash, as the sound of carriage wheels broke the uninterrupted silence, and a commotion in the water gave evidence of the sudden disappearance of several green-backed frogs, sunning themselves on a large, moss-grown rock, projecting above the water's edge; from shady nooks and crevices peeped clusters of early white violets; graceful maidenhair ferns, and hardier members of the fern family, called "Brake," uncurled their graceful, sturdy fronds from the carpet of green moss and lichen at the base of tree trunks, growing along the winter's edge. Partly hidden by rocks along the bank of the Stream, nestled a few belated cup-shaped anemones or "Wind Flowers," from which most of the petals had blown, they being-growth in the woods, in passing, could be seen the small buds of the azalea or wild honeysuckle, "Sheep's Laurel," the deep pink buds on the American Judas tree, trailing vines of "Tea Berry," and beneath dead leaves one caught an occasional glimpse of fragrant, pink arbutus. In marshy places beside the creek,<pb n="016" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=26"/> sawying in the wind from slender stems, grew straw-colored, bell-shaped blossoms of "Adder's Tongue" or "Dog Tooth Violet," with their mottled green, spike-shaoed leaves. In the shadow of a large rock grew dwarf huckleberry bushes, wild strawberry vines, and among grasses of many varieties grew patches of white and pink-tinted Alsatian clover.</p><p>Leaving behind the spicy, fragrant,"woodsy" smell of winter-green, birch and sassafras, and the faint, sweet scent of the creamy, wax-like blossoms of "Mandrake" or May apple, peeping from beneath large, umbrella-like, green leaves they emerged at last from the dim, cool shadows of the woods into the warm, bright sunlight again.</p><p>Almost before Mary realized it, the farm house could be seen in the distance, and her Uncle called her attention to his new, red barn, which had been built since her last visit to the farm, and which, in her Uncle's estimation, was of much greater importance than the house.</p><p>Mary greeted with pleasure the old landmarks to her on former visits. They passed the small, stone school house at the crossroads, and in a short time the horses turned obediently into the lane leading to the barn-a country lane in very much a tangle of blackberry vines, wild rose bushes, by farmers called "Pasture Roses," interwoven with bushes of sumach, wild carrots and golden rod.</p><p>Mary insisted that her Uncle drive directly- to the barn, as was his usual custom, while she was warmly welcomed at the farm house gate by her Aunt. As her Uncle led away the horses, he said, "I will soon join you. Mary, 'to break of our bread and eat of our salt.' as they say in the 'Shrine.'"</p><p>On their way to the house. Mary remarked : "I am so glad we reached here before dusk. The country is simply beautiful! Have you ever noticed, Aunt Sarah, what a symphony in green is the yard? Look at the buds on the maples and lilacs--a faint yellow green--and the blue-green pine tree near by; the leaves of the German iris are another shade; the grass, dotted with yellow dandelions, and blue violets; the straight, prim, reddish-brown stalks of the peonies before the leaves have unfolded, all roofed over with the blossom-covered branches of pear, apple and 'German Prune' tree. Truly, this must resemble Paradise!"</p><p>"Yes." assented her Aunt,"I never knew blossoms to remain on<pb n="017" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=27"/> the pear trees so long a time. We have had no 'blossom shower' as yet to scatter them, but there will be showers tonight, I think, or I am no prophet. I feel rain in the atmosphere, and Sibylla said a few moments ago she heard a 'rain bird' in the mulberry tree."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah," inquired Mary, "is the rhubarb large enough to use?"</p><p>"Yes, indeed, we have baked rhubarb pies and have had a surfeit of dandelion salad or 'Salat,' as our neighbors designate it. Your Uncle calls 'dandelion greens' the farmers' spring tonic; then and '<purpose>celadine</purpose>' that plant you see growing by the side of the house. Later in
the season it bears small, yellow flowers not alike a very small buttercup blossom, and it is said to be an excelent remedy for chills and fevers, and it tastes almost as bitter as quinine. There are bushels of dandelion blossoms, some of which we shall pick tomorrow, and form them make dandelion wine."</p><p>"And what use will my thrifty Aunt make of the blue violets," mischievously inquired Mary.</p>
<formula class="household"><p>"The <purpose>violets</purpose>," replied her Aunt, "I shall dig up carefully with some earth adhering to their roots and place them in a glass bowl for a centrepiece on the table for my artistic and beauty-loving niece; and if kept moist, you will be surprised at the length of time they will remain 'a thing of beauty' if not a 'joy forever.'And later, Mary, from them I'll teach you to make violet beads."</p>
</formula><p>"Aunt Sarah, notice that large robin endeavoring to pull a worm from the ground. Do you suppose the same birds return here from the South every summer?"</p><p>"Certainly, I do."</p><p>"That old mulberry tree from the berries of which you made delicious pies and marmalade last Summer, is it dead?"</p><p>"No; only late about getting its Spring outfit of leaves."</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd align="center" placement="heading">CHAPTER III.<lb/><lb/> SCHUGGENHAUS TOWNSHIP.</hd><p>"Schuggenhaus," said Sarah Landis, speaking to her niece, Mary Midleton, "is one of the largest and most populous townships in Bucks County, probably so named by the early German settlers, some of whom, I think, were my father's ancestors, as they came originally from Zweibrucken, Germany, and settled in Schuggenhaus Township. Schuggenhaus is one of the most fertile townships in Bucks County and one of the best cultivated; farming is our principal occupation, and the population of the township today is composed principally of the descendants of well-to-do Germans, frequently called 'Pennsylvania Dutch.'"</p><p>"I have often heard them called by that name," said Mary. "Have you forgotten, Aunt Sarah, you promised to tell me something interesting about the first red clover introduced in Bucks County?"</p><p>"Red clover," replied her Aunt, "that having bright, crimson-pink heads, is the most plentiful and the most common variety of clover; but knowing how abundantly it grows in different parts of the country at the present time, one would scarcely have believed, in olden times, that it would ever be so widely distributed as it now is.</p><p>"One reason clover does so well in this country is that the fertilization of the clover is produced by pollenation by the busy little bumble-bee, who carries the pollen from blossom to blossom, and clover is dependent upon these small insects for fertilization, as without them clover would soon die out."</p><p>"I admire the feathery, fuzzy, pink-tipped, rabbit-foot clover," said Mary; "it is quite fragrant, and usually covered with butterflies. It makes such very pretty bouquets when you gather huge bunches of it."</p><p>"No, Mary, I think you are thinking of Alsatian clover, which is similar to white clover. The small, round heads are cream color, tinged with pink; it is very fragrant and sweet and grows along<pb n="019" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=29"/> the roadside and, like the common white clover, is a favorite with bees. The yellow hop clover we also find along the roadside. As the heads of clover mature, they turn yellowish brown and resemble dried hops; sometimes yellow, brown and tan blossoms are seen on one branch. The cultivation of red clover was introduced here a century ago, and when in bloom the fields attracted great attention. Being the first ever grown in this part of Bucks County, people came for miles to look at it, the fence around the fields some days being lined with spectators, I have been told by my grandfather. I remember when a child nothing appeared to me blue flowers. I also remember the fields of broom-corn. Just think! We made our own brooms, wove linen from the flax raised on our farm and made our own tallow candles. Mary, from what a thrifty and hard-working lot of ancestors you are descended! You inherit from your mother your love of work and from your father your love of books. Your father's uncle was a noted Shakespearean scholar."</p>

Yet Sarah Landis was a housewife of the old school and still cooked apple butter or "Lodt Varrik," as the Germans call it; made sauerkraut and hard soap, and baked old-fashioned "German" rye bread on the hearth, which owed its excellence not only to the fact of its being hearth baked but to the rye flour being ground in an old mill in a near-by town, prepared by the old process of grinding between mill-stones instead of the more modern roller process. This picture of the old mill, taken by Fritz Schmidt, shows it is not artistic, but, like most articles of German manufacture, the mill was built more for its usefulness than to please the eye.</p>

</illustration><p>"Aunt Sarah, what is pumpernickel?" inquiry Mary, "is it like rye bread?"</p><p>"No, my dear, not exactly, it is a dark-colored bread, used in some parts of Germany. Professor Schmidt tells me the bread is usually composed of a mixture of barley flour and rye flour. Some I have eaten looks very much like our own brown bread. Pumpernickel is considered a very wholesome bread by the Germans--and I presume one might learn to relish it, but I should prefer<pb n="021" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=31"/> good, sweet, home-made rye bread. I was told by an old gentleman who came to this country from Germany when a boy, that pumpernickel was used in the German army years ago, and was somewhat similar to 'hard tack,' furnished our soldiers in the Civil War. But I cannot vouch for the truth of this assertion."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah," said Mary later, "Frau Schmidt tells me the Professor sends his rye to the mill and requests that every part of it be ground without separating-making what he calls 'whole rye flour,' and from this Frau Schmidt bakes wholesome, nutritious bread which they Call 'pumpernickel.' She tells me she uses about one-third of this 'whole rye floor' to two-thirds white bread flour when baking bread, and she considers bread made from this whole grain more wholesome and nutritious than the bread made from our fine rye flour."</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd align="center" placement="heading">CHAPTER IV.<lb/><lb/> JOHN LANDIS.</hd><p>The Bucks County farmer, John Landis, rather more scholarly in appearance than men ordinarily found in agricultural districts, was possessed of an adust complexion, caused by constant exposure to wind and weather; tall and spare, without an ounce of superfluous fat; energetic, and possessed of remarkable powers of endurance. He had a kindly, benevolent expression; his otherwise plain face was redeemed by fine, expressive brown eyes. Usually silent and preoccupied, and almost taciturn, yet he possessed a fund of dry humor. An old-fashioned Democrat, his wife was a Republican. He usually accompanied Aunt Sarah to her church, the Methodist, although he was a member of the German Reformed, and declared he had changed his religion to please her, but change his politics, never. A member of the Masonic Lodge, his only diversion was an occasional trip to the city with a party of the "boys" to attend a meeting of the "Shriners."</p><p>Aunt Sarah protested. "The idea, John, at your age, being out so late at night and returning from the city on the early milk train the following morning, and then being still several miles from home. It's scandalous!"</p><p>He only chuckled to himself; and what the entertainment had been, which was provided at Lulu Temple, and which he had so thoroughly enjoyed, was left to her imagination. His only remark when questioned was: "Sarah, you're not in it. You are not a 'Shriner.'" And as John had in every other particular fulfilled her ideal of what constitutes a good husband, Sarah, like the wise woman she was, allowed the subject to drop.</p><p>A good, practical, progressive farmer, John Landis constantly read, studied and pondered over the problem of how to produce the largest results at least cost of time and labor. His crops were skillfully planted in rich soil, carefully cultivated and usually harvsted earlier than those of his neighbors. One summer he raised potatoes so large that many of them weighed one pound each, and<pb n="023" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=33"/> new potatoes and green peas, fresh from the garden, invariably appeared on Aunt Sarah's table the first of July, and sometimes earlier. I have known him to raise cornstalks which reached a height of thirteen feet, which were almost equaled by his wife's sunflower stalks, which usually averaged nine feet in height.</p><p>Aunt Sarah, speaking one day to Mary, said: "Your Uncle John is an unusually silent man. I have heard him remark that when people talk continuously they are either very intelligent or tell untruths." He, happening to overhear her remark, quickly retorted:</p><p>"The man who speaks a dozen tongues,<lb/>When all is said and done,<lb/>Don't hold a match to him who knows<lb/>How to keep still in one."</p><p>When annoyed at his wife's talkativeness, her one fault in her husband's eyes, if he thought she had a fault, he had a way at saying, "Alright, Sarah, Alright," as much as to say "that is final; you have said enough," in his peculiar, quick manner of speaking which Aunt Sarah never resented, he being invariably kind and considerate in other respects.</p><p>John Landis was a successful farmer because he loved his work, and found joy in it. While not unmindful of the advantages possessed by the educated farmer of the present day, he said, " 'Tis not college lore our boys need so much as practical education to develop their efficiency. While much that we eat and wear comes out of the ground, we should have more farmers, the only way to lower the present high cost of living, which is such a perplexing problem to the housewife. There is almost no limit to what might be accomplished by some of our bright boys should they make agriculture a study. Luther Burbank says, 'To add but one kernel of corn to each ear grown in this country in a single year would increase the supply five million bushels.'"</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd align="center" placement="heading">CHAPTER V.<lb/><lb/> THE OLD FARM HOUSE AND GARDEN.</hd><p>The old unpainted farm house, built of logs a century ago, had changed in the passing years to a grayish tint. An addition had been built to the house several years before Aunt Sarah's occupancy. The sober hue of the house harmonized with the great, gnarled old trunk of the meadow willow nearby. Planted when the house was built, it spread its great branches protectingly over it. A wild clematis growing at the foot of the tree twined its tendrils around the masstive trunk until in late summer they had become almost covering it with feathery blossoms.</p>
<illustration><caption>Old Corn Crib</caption><description>A photograph of a building in a field.</description>

</formula><p>A short distance from the house stood the newly-built red barn, facing the pasture lot. On every side stretched fields which, in summer waved with wheat, oats, rye and buckwheat, and the corn crib stood close by, ready for the harvest to fill it to over-flowing. Beside the farm house door stood a tall, white oleandor, planted in a large, green-painted wooden tub. Near by, in a glazed earthenware pot, grew the old-fashioned lantana plant, covered with clusters of tiny blossoms, of various shades of orange, red and pink.</p><p>In flower beds outlined by clam shells which had been freshly whitewashed blossomed fuchsias, bleeding hearts, verbenas, dusty millers, sweet clove-scented pinks, old-fashioned, dignified purple digitalis or ioxglove, stately pink Princess Feather, various brilliant-hued zinnias, or more commonly called "Youth and Old Age," and as gayly colored, if more humble and lowly, portulacas; the fragrant white, star-like blossoms of the nicotiana, or "Flowering Tobacco," which, like the yellow primrose, are particularly fragrant at sunset. Geraniums of every hue, silver-leaved and rose-scented; yellow marigolds and those with brown, velvety petals; near by the pale green and white-mottled leaves of the plant called "Snow on the Mountain" and in the centre of one of the large, round flower beds, grew sturdy "Castor Oil Beans," their large, copper-bronze leaves almost covering the tiny blue forget-me-nots growing beneath. Near the flower bed grew a thrifty hush of pink-flowering almonds; not far distant grew a spreading "shrub" bush, covered with fragrant brown buds, and beside it a small tree of pearly-white snowdrops.</p><p>Sarah Landis loved the wholesome, earthy odors of growing plants and delighted in her flowers, particularly the perennials, which were planted promiscuously all over the yard. I have frequently heard her quote:"One is nearer God's heart in a garden than any place else on earth." And she would say. "I love the out-of-door life, in touch with the earth; the natural life of man or woman." Inside the fence of the kitchen garden were planted straight rows of both red and yellow currants, and several gooseberry bushes. In one corner of the garden, near the summer kitchen, stood a large bush of black currants, from the yellow, sweet-scented blossoms of which Aunt Sarah's bees, those<pb n="026" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=38"/> "Heaven instructed mathematicians," sucked honey. Think Aunt Sarah's buckwheat cakes, eaten with honey made from currant, clover, buckwheat and dandelion blossoms!</p><p>Her garden was second to none in Bucks County. She planted tomato seeds in boxes and placed them in a sunny window, raising her plants early; hence she had ripe tomatoes before any one else the neighborhood. Her peas were earlier also, and her beets and potatoes were the largest; her corn the sweetest; and, as her asparagus bed was always well salted, her asparagus was the finest to be had.</p><p>Through the centre of the garden patch, on either side to the walk, were large flower beds, a blaze of brilliant color from early Spring, when the daffodils blossomed, until frost killed the dahlias, asters, scarlet sage, sweet Williams, Canterbury bells, pink and white snapdragon, spikes of perennial, fragrant, white heliotrope blue larkspur, four o'clocks, bachelor buttons and many other dear, old-fashioned flowers. The dainty pink, funnel-shaped blossoms of the hardy swamp "Rose Mallow'" bloomed the entire Summer, the last flowers to be touched by frost, vying in beauty with the pink monthly roses planted near by.</p><p>Children who visited Aunt Sarah delighted in the small Jeru-salem cherry tree, usually covered with bright scarlet berries which was planted near the veranda, and they never tired pinching the tiny leaves of the sensitive plant to see them quickly droop, as if dead, then slowly unfold and straighten as if a thing of fire.</p><p>Visitors to the farm greatly admired the large, creamy-white, lily--like blossoms of the datura. Farthest from the house were the useful herb beds, tilled with parsley, hoarhound, sweet marjoram, lavender, saffron, sage, sweet basil, summer savory and silver-striped rosemary or "old man," as it was commonly called by country folk.</p><p>Tall clusters of phlox, a riot of color in midsummer, crimson-eyed, white and rose-colored blossoms topping the tall stems, and clusters of billiant-red bergamot. Near by had been growing, from time immemorial, a cluster of green and white striped grass without which no door yard in this section of Bucks County was considered complete in olden times. Near by, silvery plumes pampas grass gently swayed on their reed-like stems. Even the garden was not without splashes of color where, between rows of vegetables, grew pale, pink-petaled poppies, seeming to have<pb n="027" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=39"/> scarcely a foothold in the rich soil. But the daintiest, sweetest bed of all, and the one that Mary enjoyed most, was where the lilies of the valley grew in the shade near a large, white lilac bush. Here, on a rustic bench beneath an old apple tree, stitching on her embroidery, she dreamed happy dreams of her absent lover, and planned for the life they were to live together some day, in the home he was striving to earn for her by his own manly exertions; and she assiduously studied and pondered over Aunt Sarah's teaching and counsel, knowing them to be wise and good.</p><p>A short distance from the farm house, where the old orchard sloped down to the edge of the brook, grew tall meadow rue, with feathery clusters of green and white flowers; and the green, gold-lined, bowl-shaped blossoms of the "Cow Lily," homely step-sisters of the fragrant, white pond lily, surrounded by thick, waxy, green leaves, lazily floated on the surface of the water from long stems in the bed of the creek, and on the bank a carpet was formed by golden-yellow, creeping buttercups.</p><p>In the side yard grew two great clumps of iris, or, as it is more commonly called, "Blue Flag." Its blossoms, dainty as rare orchids, with lily-like, violet-veined petals of palest-tinted mauve and purple.</p><p>On the sunny side of the old farm house, facing the East, where at early morn the sun shone bright and warm, grew Aunt Sarah's pansies, with velvety, red-brown petals, golden-yellow and dark purple. They were truly "Heart's Ease," gathered with a lavish hand, and sent as gifts to friends who were ill. The more she picked the faster they multiplied, and came to many a sick bed "sweet messengers of Spring."</p><p>If Aunt Sarah had a preference for one particular flower, 'twas the rose, and they well repaid the time and care she lavished on them. She had pale-tinted blush roses, with hearts of deepest pink; rockland and prairie and hundred-leaf roses, pink and crimson ramblers, but the most highly-prized roses of her collec-tion were an exquisite, deep salmon-colored "Marquis De Sinety" and an old-fashioned pink moss rose, which grew beside a large bush of mock-orange, the creamy blossoms of the latter almost as fragrant as real orange blossoms of the sunny Southland. Not far distant planted in a small bed by themselves, grew old-fashioned, sweet-scented, double petunias, ragged, ripple, ruffled corollas of white, with splotches of brilliant crimson and purple,<pb n="028" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=40"/> their slender stems scarcely strong enough to support the heavy blossoms.</p><p>In one of the sunniest spots in the old garden grew Aunt Sarah's latest acquisition. "The Butterfly Bush," probably so named on account of its graceful stems, covered with spikes of tiny, lilac-colored blossoms, over which continually hovered large, gorgeously-hued butterflies, vying with the flowers in brilliancy of color, from early June until late Summer.</p><p>Aunt Sarah's sunflowers, or "Sonnen Blume," as she liked to call them, planted along the garden fence to feed chickens and birds alike, were a sight worth seeing. The birds generally confiscated the larger portion of seeds. A pretty sight it was to set a flock of wild canaries, almost covering the tops of the largest sunflowers, busily engaged picking out the rich, oily seeds.</p><p>Aunt Sarah loved the golden flowers, which always appeared to be nodding to the sun, and her sunflowers were particularly fine, some being as much as fifty inches in circumference.</p><p>A bouquet of the smaller ones was usually to be seen in a quaint, old, blue-flowered, gray jar on the farm house veranda in Summertime. Earlier in the season blossoms of the humble artichoke, which greatly resemble small sunflowers, or large yellow daisies, filled the jar. Failing either of these, she gathered large bouquets of golden-rod or wild carrot blossoms, both of which grew in profusion along the country lanes and roadside near the farm. But the old gray jar never held a bouquet more beautiful than the one of bright, blue "fringed gentians," gathered by Aunt Sarah in the Fall of the year, several miles distant from the farm.</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd align="center" placement="heading">CHAPTER VI.<lb/><lb/> MARY CONFIDES IN AUNT SARAH AND GIVES HER VIEWS ON SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN.</hd><p>"There's no deny'n women are foolish,<lb/>God A'mighty made them to match the men."</p><p>A short time after her arrival at the farm Mary poured into the sympathetic ear of Aunt Sarah her hopes and plans. Her lover, Ralph Jackson, to whom she had become engaged the past Winter, held a position with the Philadelphia Electric Company, and was studying hard outside working hours. His ambition was to become an electrical engineer. He was getting fair wages, and wished Mary to marry him at once. She confessed she loved Ralph too well to marry him, ignorant as she was of economical housekeeping and cooking.</p><p>Mary, early left an orphan, had studied diligently to fit herself for a kindergarten teacher, so she would be capable of earning her own living on leaving school, which accounted for her lack of knowledge of housework, cooking, etc.</p><p>Aunt Sarah, loving Mary devotedly, and knowing the young man of her choice to be clean, honest and worthy, promised to do all in her power to make their dream of happiness come true. Learning from Mary that Ralph was thin and pale from close confinement, hard work and study, and of his intention of taking a short vacation, she determined he should spend it on the farm, where she would be able to "mother him."</p><p>"You acted sensibly, Mary," said her Aunt, "in refusing to marry Ralph at the present time, realizing your lack of knowledge of housework and inability to manage a home. Neither would you know how to spend the money provided by him economically and wisely, and, in this age of individual efficiency, a business knowledge of housekeeping is almost as important in making a happy home as is love. I think it quite as necessary that a woman who marries should understand housekeeping in all its varied branches<pb n="030" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=42"/> as that the man who marries should understand his trade or profession; for, without the knowledge of moans to gain a livelihood (however great his love for a woman), how is the man to hold that woman's love and affection unless he is able by his own exertions to provide her with necessities, comforts, and, perhaps, in later years, luxuries? And in return, the wife should consider it her duty and pleasure to know how to do her work systematically; learn the value of different foods and apply the knowledge gained daily in preparing them; study to keep her husband in the best of health, physically and mentally. Then will his efficiency be greater and he will be enabled to do his 'splendid best' in whatever position in life he is placed, be he statesman or hod-carrier. What difference if an honest heart beat beneath a laborer's hickory shirt, or one of fine linen? 'One hand, if it's true, is as good as another, no matter how brawny or rough.' Mary, do not think the trivial affairs of the home beneath your notice, and do not imagine any work degrading which tends to the betterment of the home. Remember, 'Who sweeps a room as for Thy law, makes that and the action fine.'</p><p>"Our lives are all made up of such small, commonplace things and this is such a commonplace old world, Mary. 'The commonplace earth and the commonplace sky make up the commonplace day,' and 'God must have loved common people, or He would not have made so many of them.' And, what if we are commonplace? We cannot all be artists, poets and sculptors. Yet, how frequently we see people in commonplace surroundings, possessing the soul of an artist, handicapped by physical disability or lack of means! We are all necessary in the great, eternal plan. 'Tis not good deeds alone for which we receive our reward, but for the performance of duty well done, in however humble circumstances our lot is cast. Is it not Lord Houghton who says: 'Do not grasp at the stars, but do life's plain, common work as it comes, certain that daily duties and daily bread are the sweetest things of life.' I consider a happy home in the true sense of the word one of the greatest of blessings. How important is the work of the house-mother and homemaker who creates the home ! There can be no happiness there unless the wheels of the domestic machinery are oiled by loving care and kindness to make them run smoothly, and the noblest work a woman can do is training and rearing her children. Suffrage, the right of woman to vote; will it not take<pb n="031" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=43"/> women from the home? I am afraid the home will then suffer in consequence. Will man accord woman the same reverence she has received in the past? Should she have equal political rights? A race lacking respect for women would never advance socially or politically. I think women could not have a more important part in the government of the land than in rearing and educating their children to be good, useful citizens. In what nobler work could women engage than in work to promote the comfort and well-being of the ones they love in the home? I say, allow men to make the laws, as God and nature planned. I think women should keep to the sphere God made them for--the home. Said Gladstone, 'Woman is the most perfect when most womanly.' There is nothing, I think, more despicable than a masculine, mannish woman, unless it be an effeminate, sissy man. Dr. Clarke voiced my sentiments when he said:'Man is not superior to woman, nor woman to man. The relation of the sexes is one of equality, not of better or worse, of higher and lower. The loftiest ideal of humanity demands that each shall be perfect in its kind and not be hindered in its best work. The lily is not inferior to the rose, nor the oak superior to the clover; yet the glory of the lily is one and the glory of the oak is another, and the use of the oak is not the use of the clover.'</p><p>"This present-day generation demands of women greater efficiency in the home than ever before. And Mary, many of the old-time industries which I had been accustomed to as a girl have passed away. Eletricity and numerous labor-saving devices make household tasks easier, eliminating some altogether. When housekeeping you will find time to devote to many important questions of the day which we old-time housekeepers never dreamed of having. Considerable thought should be given to studying to improve and simplify conditions of the home-life. It is your duty. Obtain books; study food values and provide those foods which nourish the body, instead of spending time uselessly preparing dainties to tempt a jaded appetite. Don't spoil Ralph when you marry him. Give him good, wholesome food, and plenty of it; but although the cooking of food takes up much of a housekeeper's time, it is not wise to allow it to take up one's time to the exclusion of everything else. Mary, perhaps my views are old-fashioned. I am not a 'new woman' in any sense of the word. The new woman may take her place beside man in the business world and prove equally<pb n="032" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=44"/> as efficient, but I do not think woman should invade man's sphere any more than he should assume her duties."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah. I am surprised to hear you talk in that manner about woman's sphere," replied Mary, "knowing what a success you are in the home, and how beautifully you manage everything you undertake. I felt, once you recognized the injustice done women in not allowing them to vote, you would feel differently, and since women are obliged to obey the laws, should they not have a voice in choosing the lawmakers? When you vote, it will not take you out of the home. You and Uncle John will merely stop on your way to the store, and instead of Uncle John going in to write and register what he thinks should be done and by whom it should be done, you too will express your opinion. This will likely be twice a year. By doing this, no woman loses her womanliness, goodness or social position, and to these influences the vote is but another influence. I know there are many things in connection with the right of equal suffrage with which you do not sympathize.</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, let me tell you about a dear friend of mine who taught school with me in the city. Emily taught a grammar grade, and did not get the same salary the men teachers received for doing the same work, which I think was unfair. Emily studied and frequently heard and read ahout what had been done in Colorado and other States where women vote. She got us all interested, and the more we learned about the cause the harder we worked for it. Emily married a nice, big, railroad man. They bought a pretty little house in a small town, had three lovely children and were very happy. More than ever as time passed Emily realized the need of woman's influence in the community. It is true, I'll admit, Aunt Sarah, housekeeping and especially homemaking are the great duties of every woman, and to provide the most wholesome, nourishing food possible for the family is the duty of every mother, as the health, comfort and happiness of the family depend so largely on the 
<emph rend="italic">common sense</emph> (only another name for efficiency) and skill of the homemaker, and the wise care and thought she expends on the preparation of wholesome, nutritious food in the home, either the work of her own hands or prepared under her direction. You can 
<emph rend="italic">not</emph> look after those duties without getting 
<emph rend="italic">outside</emph> of your home, especially when you live like Emily, in a town where the conditions are so different from living as you<pb n="033" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=45"/> do on a farm in the country. Milk, bread and water are no longer controlled by the woman in her home, living in cities and towns; and just because women want to look out for their families they should have a voice in the larger problems of municipal housekeeping. To return to Emily, she did not bake her own bread, as you do, neither did she keep a cow, but bought milk and bread to feed the children. Wasn't it her duty to leave the home and see where these products were produced, and if they were sanitary? And, knowing the problem outside the home would so materially affect the health, and perhaps lives, of her children, she felt it her distinctive duty to keep house in a larger sense. When the children became old enough to attend school, Emily again took up her old imtrest in schools. She began to realize how much more just it would be if an equal number of women were on the school board."</p><p>"But what did the husband think of all this?" inquired Aunt Sarah, dubiously.</p><p>"Oh, Tom studied the case, too, at first just to tease Emily, but he soon became as enthusiastic as Emily. He said. 'The first time you are privileged to vote, Emily, I will hire an automobile to take you to the polls in style.' But poor Emily was left alone with her children last winter. Tom died of typhoid fever. Contracted it from the bad drainage. They lived in a town not yet safe-guarded with sewerage. Now Emily is a taxpayer as well as a mother, and she has no say as far as the town and schools are concerned. There are many cases like that, where widows and un-married women own property, and they are in no way represented. And think of the thousands and thousands of women who have no home to stay in and no babies to look after."</p><p>"Mary, Mary! Do stop to take breath. I never thought when I started this subject I would have an enthusiastic suffragist with whom to deal."</p><p>"I am glad you started the subject, Aunt Sarah, because there is so much to be said for the cause. I saw you glance at the clock and I see it is time to prepare supper. But some day I'm going to stop that old clock and bring down some of my books on 'Woman's Suffrage' and you'll be surprised to hear what they have done in States where equal privileges were theirs. I am sure 'twill not be many years before every State in the Union will give women the right of suffrage."</p><pb n="034" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=46"/><p>After Mary retired that evening Aunt Sarah had a talk with her John, whom she knew needed help on the farm. As a result of the conference, Mary wrote to Ralph the following day, asking him to spend his vacation on the farm as a "farm hand." Needless to say, the offer was gladly accepted by Ralph, if for no other reason than to be near the girl he loved.</p><p>Ralph came the following week--"a strapping big fellow," to quote Uncle John, being several inches over six feet.</p><p>"All you need, young chap," said Mary's Uncle, "is plenty of good, wholesome food of Sarah's and Mary's preparing, and I'll see that you get plenty of exercise in the fresh air to give you an appetite to enjoy it, and you'll get a healthy coat of tan on your pale cheeks before the Summer is ended."</p><p>Ralph Jackson, or "Jack," as he was usually called by his friends, an orphan like Mary, came of good, old Quaker stock, his mother having died immediately after giving birth to her son. His father, supposed to be a wealthy contractor, died when Ralph was seventeen, having lost his fortune through no fault of his own, leaving Ralph penniless.</p><p>Ralph Jackson possessed a good face, a square, determined jaw, sure sign of a strong will and quick temper; these Berserker traits he inherited from his father; rather unusual in a Quaker. He possessed a head of thick, coarse, straight brown hair, and big honest eyes. One never doubted his word, once it had been given. 'Twas good as his bond. This trait he inherited also from his father, noted for his truth and integrity. Ralph was generous to a fault. When a small boy he was known to take off his shoes and give them to a poor little Italian (who played a violin on the street for pennies) and go home barefoot.</p><p>Ralph loved Mary devotedly, not only because she fed him well at the farm, as were his forefathers, the "Cave Men," fed by their mates in years gone by, but he loved her first for her sweetness of disposition and lovable ways; later, for her quiet unselfishness and lack of temper over trifles--so different from himself.</p><p>When speaking to Mary of his other fine qualities, Aunt Sarah said: "Ralph is a manly young fellow; likeable, I'll admit, but his hasty temper is a grave fault in my eyes."</p><p>Mary replied, "Don't you think men are very queer, anyway, Aunt Sarah? I do, and none of us is perfect."</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=47"/>

Mary had a sweet, motherly way seldom met with in so young a girl, and this appealed to Ralph, he having never known "mother love," and although not at all inclined to be sentimental, he always called Mary his "Little Mother Girl" because of her motherly ways.</p><p>"Well," continued Mary's Aunt, "a quick temper is one of the most difficult faults to overcome that flesh is heir to, hut Ralph, his temper and learn to control it, knowing that unless he does so it will handicap him in his career. Still, a young girl will overlook many faults in the man she loves. Mary, ere marrying, one should be sure that no love be lacking to those entering these sacred bonds. "Tis not for a day, but for a lifetime, to the right thinking. Marriage, as a rule, is too lightly entered into in this Twentieth Century of wasy divorces, and but few regard matrimony in its true holy relation, ordinated by our Creator. If it be founded on the tower of enduring love and not ephemeral passion, it is unassailable, lasting in faith and honor until death breaks the sacred union and annuls the vows pledged at God's holy altar." </p>

"</p><p>Speaking to Mary of life on the farm one day, Ralph laughingly said: "I am taught something new every day. Yesterday your Uncle told me it was 'time to plant corn when oak leaves were large as squirrels' ears.' " Ralph worked like a Trojan. In a short time both his hands and face took on a butternut hue. He became strong and robust. Mary called him her "Cave Man," and it taxed the combined efforts of Aunt Sarah and Mary to provide food to satisfy the ravenous appetite Mary's "Cave Man" developed. And often, after a busy day, tired but happy, Mary fell poplar outside her bedroom window.</p><p>But country life on a farm has its driveions. One of Mary's and Ralph's greatest pleasures after a busy day at the farm was a drive about the surrounding country early Summer evenings, frequently accompanied by either Elizabeth or Pauline Schmidt, their nearest neighbors.</p><p>One of the first places visited by them was a freak of nature called "Rocky Valley." situated at no great distance from the farm.</p><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=51"/><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=52"/>

He came originally from Heidelberg, but had occupied the position of Professor; a perfect Lord Chesterfield in manners. Very tall, thin almost to emaciation, although possessed of excellent health; refined, scholarly looking; a rather long, hooked nose, faded, pale-blue eyes; snowy, flowing "Lord Dundreary" whiskers, usually parted in the centre and twisted to a point on either side with the exceedingly long, bony lingers of his well-kept, aristocratic-looking white hands. He had an abrupt, quick, nervous manner when speaking. A fringe of thin, white hair showed at the lower edge of the black silk skull cap which he invariably wore about home, and in the absence of this covering for his bald head, he would not have looked natural to his friends.</p><p>The Professor always wore a suit of well-brushed, "shiny" black broadcloth, and for comfort old-fashioned soft kid "gaiters," with elastic in the sides. He was a man with whome one did not easily become acquainted, having very decided opinions on most subjects. He possessed exquisite taste, a passionate love of music, flowers and all things beautiful; rather visionary, poetical and a dreamer; he was not practical, like his wife; warm-hearted, impulsive, energetic Frau Schmidt. who was noted for her executive ability. I can imagine the old Professor saying as Mohammed has been quoted as saying, "Had I two loaves, I would sell one and buy hyacinths to feed my soul." Impulsive, generous to a fault, quick to take offense, withal warm-hearted, kind and loyal to his friends, he was beloved by the the students, who declared that "Old Snitzy" always played fair when he was obliged to reprimand them for thrir numerous pranks, which ended sometimes. I am<pb n="038" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=54"/> Obliged to confess, with disastrous results. The dignified old Professor would have raised his mild, blue, spectacled eyes in astonishment had he been so unfortunate as to have overheard the boys, to whom he was greatly attached, call their dignified preceptor by such a nickname.</p><p>The Professor's little black-eyed German wife, many years younger than her husband, had been, before her marriage, teacher of domestic science in a female college in a large city. "She-was a most excellent housekeeper," to quote the Professor, and "a good wife and mother."</p><p>The family consisted of "Fritz," a boy of sixteen, with big. innocent, baby-blue eyes like his father, who idolized his only son. who was alike a joy and a torment. Fritz attended the university in a near-by town, and was usually head of the football team. He was always at the front in any mischief whatever, was noted for getting into scrapes innumerable through his love of fun, yet he possessed such a good-natured, unselfish, happy-go-lucky disposition that one always forgave him.</p><p>Black-eyed, red-cheeked Elizabeth was quick and impulsive, like her mother. A very warm and lasting friendship sprung up between merry Elizabeth and serious Mary Midleton during Mary's Summer on the farm, although not at all alike in either looks or disposition, and Elizabeth was Mary's junior by several years.</p><p>The third, last and least of the Professor's children was Pauline, or "Pollykins," as she was always called by her brother Fritz, the seven-year-old pet and baby of the family. A second edition of Fritz, the same innocent, questioning, violet-blue eyes, fair complexion, a kissable little mouth and yellow, kinky hair, she won her way into every one's heart and became greatly attached to Mary, who was usually more patient with the little maid (who, I must confess, was sometimes very willful) than was her sister Elizabeth. Mary, who had never been blessed with a sister, dearly children, and thought small "Polly" adorable and never wearied telling her marvelous fairy tales. </p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=55"/>

I see greater possibilities in that trunk of partly-worn clothing than, I suppose, a less economically-inclined woman than I ever would have dreamed of."</p><p>Mary handed her Aunt two blue seersucker dresses, one plain, the other striped. "They have both shrunken, and are entirely too small for me," said Mary.</p><p>"Well," said her Aunt, considering, "they might be combined in one dress, but you need aprons for kitchen work more useful than those little frilly, embroidered affairs you are wearing. We should make them into serviceable aprons to protect your dresses. Mary, neatness is an attribute that every self-respecting housewife should assiduously cultivate, and no one can be neat in a kitchen without a suitable apron to protect one from grime, flour and dust."</p><p>"What a pretty challis dress; its cream-colored ground sprinkled over with pink rose buds!"</p><p>Mary sighed. "I always did love that dress, Aunt Sarah. 'Twas so becoming, and he-he-admired it so !"</p><p>"And HE, can do so still." replied Aunt Sarah, with a merry twinkle in her kind, clear, gray eyes, "for that pale-green suesine skirt, slightly faded, will make an excellent lining, with cotton for an interlining, and pale green Germantown yarn with which to tie the comfortable. At small cost you'll have a dainty, warm spread which will be extremely pretty in the home you are planning with HIM. I have several very pretty old-style patchwork quilts in a box in the attic which I shall give you when you start housekeeping. That pretty dotted, ungored Swiss skirt will make dainty, ruffled sash curtains for bedroom windows.

An economical young couple In-ginning life with a homely, home-made rag carpet, have achieved in middle age. by their own energy and industry, carpets of tapestry and rich velvet, and costly furniture in keeping; but, never--never, dear, are they so valued, 1 assure you, as those inexpensive articles, conceived by our inventive brain and manufactured by our own deft fingers during our happy Springtime of life when, with our young lover husband, we built our home nest on the foundation of pure unselfish, self-sacrificing love."</p><p>Aunt Sarah sighed; memory led her far back to when she had planned her home with her lover, John Landis, still her lover, though both have grown gray together, and shared alike the joys and sorrows of the passing; years. Aunt Sarah had always been the perfect "housemother" or "Haus Frau," as the Germans phrase it, and on every line of her matured face could be read an anxious care for the family welfare. Truly could it be said of her. in the language of Henry Ward Beecher: "Whoever makes home seem to the young dearer and happier is a public benefactor."</p><p>Aunt Sarah said earnestly to Mary, "I wish it were possible for me to impart to young, inexperienced girls, about to become housewives and housemothers, a knowledge of those small economics, so necessary to health and prosperity, taught me by many years of hard work, mental travail, experience and some failures. In this extravagant Twentieth Century economy is more imperative than formerly. We feel that we need so much more these days than our grandmothers needed; and what we need, or feel that we need, is so costly. The housemother has larger problem? today than yesterday.</p><p>"Every husband should give his wife an allowance according to his income, so that she will be able to systematize her buying and occasionally obtain imperishable goods at less cost. Being encouraged thus to use her dormant economical powers; she will become a powerful factor in the problem of homemaking along lines that will essentially aid her husband in acquiring a comfotable competency, if not a fortune. Then she will have her husband' s interest truly at heart; will study to spend his money carefully, and to the best advantage; and she herself, even, will<pb n="041" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=59"/> be surprised at the many economies which will suggest themselves to save his hard-earned money when she handles that money herself, which certainly teaches her the saving habit and the value of money.</p><p>"The majority of housewives of today aren't naturally inclined to be extravagant or careless. It is rather that they lack the knowledge and experience of spending money, and spending it to the best advantage for themselves and their household needs.</p><p>" Tis a compulsory law in England, I have heard, to allow a wife pin money, according to a man's means. 'Tis a most wise law. To a loyal wife and mother it gives added force, dignity and usefulness to have a sufficient allowance and to be allowed unques-tioningly to spend that money to her best ability. Her husband, be he a working or professional man, would find it greatly to his advantage in the home as well as in his business and less of a drain on his bank account should he give his wife a suitable allowance and trust her to spend it according to her own intelligence and thrift.</p><p>"Child, many a man is violently prejudiced against giving a young wife money; many allow her in run up bills, to her hurt and to his rather than have her. even in her household expenditure, independent of his supervision. I sincerely hope, dear, that your intended, Ralph Jackson, will be superior to this male idiosyncrasy, to term it mildly, and allow you a stated sum monthly. The home is the woman's kingdom, and she should be allowed to think for it, to buy for it, and not to be cramped by lack of money to do as she thinks best for it."</p><p>"But. Aunt Sarah, some housewives are so silly that husbands cannot really be blamed for them and preventing them from frittering it away in useless extravagance."</p><p>"Mary, wise wives should not suffer for those whoe are silly and extravagant. I don't like to be sarcastic, but with the majority of the men. silliness appeals to them more than common sense. Men like to feel their superiority to us. However, though inex-perienced. Mary, yon aren't silly or extravagant. and Ralph could safely trust you with his money. It makes a woman so self-re-specting puts on her oil her m to have money to do as she pleases with, to be trusted, relied upon as a reasoning, responsible being. A man, especially a young husband, makes a grave mistake<pb n="042" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=60"/> when he looks upon his wife as only a toy to amuse him in his leisure moments and not as one to be trusted to aid him in his life work. A trusted young housewife, with a reasonable and regular allowance at her command, he she ever so inexperienced, will soon plan to have wholesome, nutritious food at little cost, instead of not knowing until a half hour before time what she will serve. She would save money and the family would be better nourished; nevertheless, I would impress it on the young housewife not to be too saving or practice too close economy especially when buying milk and eggs, as there is nothing mure nutritious or valuable. A palatable macaroni and cheese; eggs or a combination of eggs and milk, are dishes which may be substituted occasionally, at less expense, for meat. A pound of macaroni and cheese equals a pound of steak in food value. Take time and trouble to see that all food be well cooked and served, both in an attractive and appetizing manner. Buy the cheaper cuts of slewing meats, and by long, slow simmering, they will become sweet and tender and of equal nutritive value as higher priced sirloins and tenderloins.</p><p>"But, Mary, I've not yet finished that trunk and its contents. That slightly-faded pink chambray I'll cut up into quilt blocks. Made up with white patches, and quilted nicely, a pretty quilt, lined with white, will be evolved. I have such a pretty design of pink and white called the "Winding Way." very simple to make. The beauty of the quilt consists altogether in the manner in which the blocks are put together, or it might be made over the pattern called "The Flying Dutchman." From that tan linen skirt may be made a laundry bag, shoe pocket, twine bag, a collar bag and a table runner, the only expense being several skeins of green embroidery silk, and a couple yards of green cord to draw the bags up with, and a couple of the same-hued skirt braids for binding edges, and." teasingly. "Mary, you might embroider Ralph Jackson's initials on the collar and laundry bag."</p><p>Mary blushed .rosily red and exclaimed in an embarrassed manner most bewitchingly, "Oh!"</p><p>Aunt Sarah laughed. She thought to have Mary look that way 'twas worth teasing her.</p><p>"Well. Mary, we can in leisure moments, from that coarse, white linen skirt which you have discarded, make bureau scarfs, sideboard cover, or a set of scalloped table mats to place under hot dishes on your dining-room table.

I always save the dye for this purpose, they come in such pretty bright colors. The rags, when sewed together with some I have in the attic, we'll have woven into a useful carpet for the home you are planning."</p><p>"Oh! Aunt Sarah," exclaimed Mary, "do you mean a carpet like the one in the spare bedroom?"</p><p>"Yes, my dear, exactly like that, if you wish." </p><p>"Indeed I do, and I think one like that quite good enough to have in a dining-room. I think it so pretty.It does not look at all like a common rag carpet."</p><p>"No, my dear, it is nothing very uncommon. It is all in the way it is woven. Instead of having two gay rainbow stripes about three inches wide running through the length of the carpet, I had it woven with the ground work white and brown chain to form checks. Then about an inch apart were placed two threads of two shades of red woolen warp, alternating with two threads of two shades of green, across the whole width, running the length of the carpet. It has been greatly admired, as it is rather different from that usually woven. All the rag carpets I found in the house when we moved here, made by John's mother, possessed very wide stripes of rainbow colors, composed of shaded reds, yellows, blues and greens. You can imagine how very gorgeous they were, and so very heavy. -Many of the country weavers use linen chain or wrap instead of cotton, and always use wool wrap for the strips."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, I want something so very much for the Colonial bedroom I should like to have when I have a home of my very own."</p><p>"What is it dear?

They are easily made from carpet rags. I have already planned in my mind a pretty rag rug for you, to be made from your old, garnet merino shirtwaist, combined with your discarded cravenette stormcoat.</p><p>"And you'll need some pretty quilts, also," said her Aunt.</p><p>"I particularly admire the tree quilts," said Mary.</p><p>"You may have any one you choose; the one called 'Tree of Paradise,' another called 'Pineapple Design,' which was originally a border to 'Fleur de lis' quilt or 'Pine Tree,' and still another called 'Tree of Life,' and 'The Lost Rose in the Wilderness.'"</p><p>"They are all so odd," said Mary, "I scarcely know which one I think prettiest."</p><p>"All are old-fashioned quilts, which I prize highly," continued her Aunt. "Several I pieced together when a small girl. 1 think old-time patchwork too pretty am! useful an accomplishment to have gone out of fashion.</p><p>"You shall have a small stand cover like the one you admired so greatly, given me by Aunt Cornelia. It is very simple, the materials required being a square of yard-wide unbleached muslin. In the certre of this baste a large, blue-flowered handkerchief with cream-colored ground, to match the muslin. Turn up a deep hem all around outside edge' cut out quarter circles of the handherchief at each of four corners ; baste neatly upon the muslin, leaving a space of muslin the same width as the hem around each quarter circle; briarstitch all turned-in edges with dark-blue embroidery silk, being washable, these do nicely as covers for small tables or stands on the veranda in Summertime."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah," ecstatically exclaimed Mary, "you are a wizard to plan so many useful things from a trunk of apparently useless rags. What a treasure Uncle has in you. I was fretting about having so little to make my home attractive, but I feel quite elated at the thought of having a carpet and rugs already planned, besides the numerous other things evolved from your fertile brain."</p><p>Aunt Sarah loved a joke.

Whittier hear him repeat 'Thanatopsis,' by Bryant, and 'The Builders,' by Longfellow. The rhymes of the 'Fireside Poet' are easily understood, and never fail to touch the heart of common folk. I know it appears odd to see so many of my favorite poems sandwiched in between old, valued cooking recipes, but, Mary, the happiness of the home life depends so largely on the food we consume. On the preparation and selection of the food we eat depends our health, and on our health is largely on the food we eat depends our prosperity. Who is it has said, 'The discovery; of a new dish makes more for the happiness of man than the discovery of a star'? So, dearie, you see there is not such a great difference between the one who writes a poem an dthe one who makes a pie. I think cooking should be considered one of the fine arts-and the woman who prepares a dainty, appetizing dish of food, which appeals to the sense of taste, should be considered as worthy of<pb n="047" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=69"/> praise as the artist who paints a fine picture to gratify our sense of sight I try to mix all the poetry possible in prosaic everyday life We country farmers wives, not having the opportunities of our more fortune city sisters, such as witnessing plays from Shakespeare, listening to symphony concerts etc., turn to 'The Friendship of Books,' of which Washington Irving writes 'Cheer us with the true friendship, which never deceived hope nor iti-scrled sorrow.'

"Chautauqua meetings will commence the latter part of June, and I will expect you and Ralph to visit us then. I think Chautauqua a godsend to country women, especially farmers' wives; it takes them away from their monotonous daily toil and gives them new thoughts and ideas."</p><p>"I can readily understand, Aunt Sarah, why the poem, 'Life's Common Things," appeals to you; it is because you see beauty in everything.

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER X.</hd><hd align="center">SIBYLLA LINSABIGLER.</hd><p>A very original character was Sibylla Linsabigler, who had ken a member of the Landis household several years. She was Aunt Sarah's only maid servant, but she disliked being referred to as a servant, and when she overheard "Fritz" Schmidt, as he passed the Landis farm on his way to the creek for a day's fishing, call to Mary:"Miss Miidleton, will you please send the butter over with the servant today, as I shall not return home in time for dinner?" Sibylla said, "I ain't no servant. I'm hired girl. What does that make out if I do work here? Pop got mad with me 'cause I wouldn't work at home no more for him and Mom without they paid me. They got three more girls to home yet that can do the work. My Pop owns a big farm and sent our 'Chon' to the college, and it's mean 'fer' him not to give us girls money for dress, so I work out. "Taint right the way us people what has to work are treated these days." said Sibylla to herself, as she applied the broom vigorously to the gay-flowered carpet in the Landis parlor. "Because us folks got to work ain't no reason why them tony people over to the Perfessor's should call me a 'servant.' I guess I know I milk the cows, wash dishes, scrub floors, and do the washin' and ir'nin' every)' week, but I'm no servant.' I'm just as good any day as that good-fer-nothin' Perfessor's son," continued Sibylla, growing red in the face with indignation. "Didn't I hear that worthless scamp, Fritz Schrnidt, a-referrin' to me and a-sayin' to Miss Midleton fer the 'servant' to bring over the butter? Betch yer life this here 'servant' ain't a-goin' to allow eddicatcd people to make a fool of her. First chance I get I'll give that Perfesser a piece of my mind."</p><p>Sibylla's opportunity came rather unexpectedly. The gentle, mild-mannered Professor was on good terms with his sturdy, energetic neighbor, John Landis. and frequently visited him for a neighborly chat. On this particular day he called as usual and found Sibylla in the mood described.</p><pb n="052" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=74"/><p>"Good afternoon, Sibylla," said the Professor, good-naturedly. "How are you today?"</p><p>"I'd be a whole lot better if some people weren't so smart," replied Sibylla, venting her feelings on the broom. "Should think a Perfesser would feel himself too big to talk to a 'servant'."</p><p>"On the contrary, my dear girl, I feel honored. I presume you are not feeling as well as usual. What makes you think it is condescension for me to address you ?" asked the genial old man, kindly.</p><p>"Well, since you ask me, I don't mind a-tellin' you. Yesterday your son insulted me. I won't take no insult from nobody. I am just as good as what you are, even if I hain't got much book larnin'."</p><p>With this deliverance, Sibylla felt she had done full justice to the occasion and would have-closed the interview abruptly had not the Professor, with a restraining hand, detained her.</p><p>"We must get to the bottom of this grievance, Sibylla. I am sure there is some mistake somewhere. What did my son say?"</p><p>"Wel1, if you want to know," replied the irate domestic, "I'll tell you. He called me a 'servant.' I know I'm only a working girl, but your son nor nobody else ain't got on tight to abuse me by callin'me a'servant'."</p><p>"Ah! I see. You object to the term 'servant' being applied to you," said the Professor, comprehendingly. "The word 'servant' is distasteful to you. Yon feel it is a disgrace to be called a servant I see I see!" In a fatherly way. the old man resumed: "In a certain sense we are all servants. The history of human achievements is a record of service. The men and women who have helped the world most were all servants--servants to humanity. The happiest man is he who serves. God calls some men to sow and some to reap ; some to work in wood and stone; to sing and speak. Work is honorable in all, regardless of the capacity in which we serve. There is no great difference, after all, between the ordinary laborer and the railroad president; both are servants, and the standard of measurement to be applied to each man is the same. It is not so much a question of station in life as it is the question of efficiency. Best of all, work is education. There is culture that comes without college and university. He who graduates from the college of hard work is as honorable as he who takes a degree at Yale or Harvard; for wisdom can be<pb n="053" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=75"/> found In shop and foundry, field and factory, in the kitchen amid pots and kettles, as well as in office and school. The truly educated man is the man who has learned the duty and responsibility of doing something useful, something helpful, something to make this old world of ours better and a happier place in which to live. The word 'servant,' Sibylla, is a beautiful one, rightly understood The greatest man who ever lived was a servant. All His earthly ministry was filled with worthy deeds. When man man pleaded with him to rest He answered. 'My father worketh hitherto, and I work.' When one of Christ's followers desired to express the true nature of his work and office, he called himself a servant, He used a word, 'doulos,' which means, in the Greek language, a slave or a bond-servant. By the word 'doulos' he meant to say that his mission in life was to work, to do good, to serve. This man was a great preacher, but it is possible for any one to become a 'doulos' in so far as he is willing to serve God and his fellowman. You see. Sibylla, the spirit of Christian work and brotherly love is the spirit of 'doulos.' The word has been transformed by service and unselfish devotion to duty. Great men who have blessed the world, and good and noble women who have helped to uplift humanity, have done it through service. It is just as honorable to bake well, and cook well, and to do the humblest daily tasks efficiently as it is to play well on the piano and talk fluently about the latest books."</p><p>At the conclusion of the Professor's little talk on the dignity of labor. a new light shone in Sibylla's eyes and a new thought gripped her soul. The spirit of "doulos" had displaced her antipathy toward the word servant.</p><p>"I'll take that butter over to the Perfesser's home right away," she said to herself.</p><p>Before leaving Sibylla, the Professor quoted from the "Toiling of Felix." by Henry Vandyke:</p><p>Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving sod, All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God, March together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare; Honest toil is holy service, faithful work is praise and prayer."</p><pb n="054" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=76"/><p>They who work without complaining, do the holy will of God.</p><p>Heaven is blest with perfect rest, but the blessing of earth is toil.</p><p>Sibylla Linsabigler was a healthy, large-boned, solidly-built, typical "Pennsylvania German" girl. Her clear, pinkish complexion looked as if freshly scrubbed with soap and water. A few large, brown freckles adorned the bridge of her rather broad, flat nose. She possessed red hair and laughing, red-brown eyes, large mouth, which disclosed beautiful even, white teeth when she smiled, extraordinary large feet and hands, strong, willing and usually good-natured, although she processed of a quick temper, as her red hair indicated. Kind-hearted to a fault, she was of great assistance to Aunt Sarah, although she preferred any other work to that of cooking or baking. She kept the kitchen as well as other parts of the house, to quote Aunt Sarah, "neat as a pin," and did not object to any work, however hard or laborious, as long as she was greatly attached to both Aunt Sarah and Mary, but stood rather in awe of John Landis, who had never spoken a cross word to her in the three years she had lived at the farm.</p><p>Sarah Landis, knowing Sibylla to be an honest, industrious girl, appreciated her good qualities, thought almost as much of Sibylla as if she had been her daughter, and treated her in like manner, and for this reason, if for no other, she received willing service from the girl.</p><p>Sibylla, a swift worker at all times, never finished work so quickly as on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, when she "kept company" with Jake Crouthamel. "Chake." as Sibylla called him. was a sturdy, red-faced young farmer, all legs and arms. He appeared to he put together loosely at the joints, like a jumping-jack, and never appeared at ease in his ill-fitting "store clothes." He usually wore gray corduroy trusers and big cowhide boots, a pink and white striped shirt and red necktie.</p><p>Sibylla did not notice his imperfections and thought him handsome as a Greek god.</p><p>Jake, an honest, industrious young fellow, worked on 3 near-by<pb n="055" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=77"/> farm owned his own carriage, and had the privilege of using one of the farm horses when he wished, so he and Sibylla frequently took "choy rides," as Sibylla called them.</p><p>Jake Crouthamel was usually called "Boller-Yockel," this name having been accorded him on account of his having delivered to a purchaser a load of hay largely composed of rag-weed. The man called him an old "Boller-Yocked" and the name had clung to Jake for years.</p>

<illustration><caption>A "HIT-AND-MISS" RUG</caption><description>A picture of small circular rug with a dark center and border and lighter material between.</description>
</illustration><p>Indeed, I've not forgotten, and will make my promise good at once." said Aunt Sarah. "We shall need quantities of carpet rag, cut about one-half inch in width, the same as those used for<pb n="057" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=79"/> making rag carpet. Of course, you are aware, Mary, that heavier materials should be cut in narrower strips than those of thinner materials. You will also require a long, wooden crochet needle, about as thick as an ordinary wooden hook at one end, similar to a common bone crochet needle, only larger, For a circular rug, crochet about twelve stitches (single crochet) over one end of a piece of candle wick or cable cord; or, lacking either of these, use a carpet rag of firm material; then draw the crocheted strip into as small a circle as possible, fasten and crochet round and round continuously until finished. The centre of a circular or oblong rug may be a plain color, with border of colored light and dark rags, sewed together promiscuously, called Hit and Miss.'</p>

"With a package of brown dye. We can quickly transform some light, woolen carpet rags I possess into pretty shades of browns and tans.</p>

</illustration><p>"For a circular rug, with design in centre resembling a pinwheel, commence crocheting the rug same as preceding one. Crochet three rows of one color, then mark the rug off into four parts, placing a pin to mark each section or quarter of the rug. At each of four points crochet one stitch of a contrasting shade. Crochet once around the circle, using a shade similar to that of the centre of rug for design, filling in between with the other shade. For the following row, crochet two stitches beneath the one stitch (not directly underneath the stich but one stich beyond), filling in between with the other color. The third row.<pb n="059" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=81"/> add three stitches beneath the two manner as preceding row, and continue, until design in centre is as large as desired, then crochet 'Hit or Miss' or stripes. Do not cut off the carpet rags at each of the four points after crocheting stitches, but allow each one to remain and crochet over them, then pick up on needle and crochet every time you require stitches of contrasting shade. Then crochet several rows around the rug with different shades until rug is the required size. The under side should be finished off as neatly as the right, or upper side. Mary, when not making a design, sew the rags together as if for weaving carpet. When crocheting circular rugs, occasionally stretch the outside row to prevent the rug from curling up at edges when finished, as it would be apt to do if too tightly crocheted. If necessary, occasionally add an extra stitch. Avoid also crocheting it too loosely, as it would then appear like a ruffle. The advantage of crocheting over a heavy cord is that the work may be easily drawn up more tightly if too lose."</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XII.</hd><hd align="center">MARY IMITATES NAVAJO BLANKETS.</hd><p>On her return from an afternoon spent at Professor Schmidt's, Mary remarked to Aunt Sarah, "For the first time in my life I have an original idea!"</p><p>"Do tell me child. what it is!"</p><p>"The 'New Colonial' rag rugs we have lately finished are fine, but I'd just love to have a Navajo blanket like those owned by professor Schmidt; and I intend to make a rag rug in imitation of his Navajo blanket."</p><p>"Yes," answered her Aunt. "I have always greatly admired them myself, especially the large gray one which covers the Professor's own chair in the library. The Professor brought them with him when he returned from "Cutler's Ranch' at Rociada, near Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he visited his nephew, poor Raymond, or rather, I should say, fortunate Raymond, an only child of the Professor's sister. A quiet, studious boy, he graduated at the head of his class at an early age, but he inherited the weak lungs of his father, who died of consumption. Raymond was a lovable hoy, with a fund of dry humor and wit-the idol of his mother, who, taking the advice of a specialist, accompanied boy, as a last resort, to New Mexico, where, partly swing to his determination to get well, proper food and daily rides on the mesa, on the back of his little pinto pony, he regained perfect health, and today is well, happily married and living in Pasadena, California, so I have been told by Frau Schmidt, who dearly loves the boy."</p><p>"But Mary, forgive an old woman for rambling away from the subject in which you are interested-Navajo blankets. Ever since we planned to make a rug with a swastika in the centre, I have been trying to evolve from my brain (and your Uncle John says my bump of inventiveness is abnormally large) a Navajo rag rug for the floor of the room you intend to furnish as Ralph's den, in the home you are planning Well my dear a wooden<pb n="061" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=83"/> crochet hook in your deft fingers will be the magic wand which will perform a miracle and transform into Navajo blankets such very commonplace articles as your discarded gray eiderdown kimona, and a pair of your Uncle's old gray trousers, which have already been washed and ripped by Sibylla, to be used for making carpet rags. These, combined with the gray skirt I heard you say had outlived its day of usefulness, will furnish the back-ground of the rug. The six traiangles in the centre of the rug, also lighter stripes at each end of the rug, we will make of that old linen chair-cover and your faded linen skirt, which you said I might use for carpet rags; and should more material be needed. I have some old, gray woolen underwear in my patch lag, a gray-white, similar to the real Navajo. The rows of black with which we shall outline the triangles may be made from those old, black, silk-lisle hose you gave me, by cutting them round and round in one continuous strip. Heavy cloth should be cut in 
<emph rend="italic">very</emph> narrow strips. Sibylla will do that nicely; her hands are more used to handling large, heavy shears than are yours. The linen-lawn skirt you may cut in strips about three-fourths of an inch in width, as that material is quite thin. I would sew rags of one color together like carpet rags, not lapping the ends more than necessary to hold them together. The rug will be reversible, both sides being exactly alike when finished. I should make the rug about fifty-three stitches across. This will require about six and one-fourth yards of carpet rags, when sewed together, to crochet once across." I think it would be wise to cut all rags of different weight materials before commencing to crochet the rug, so they may be well mixed through. I will assist you with the work at odd moments, and in a short time the rug will be finished."</p><p>The rug, when finished, was truly a work of art. and represented many hours of labor and thought. Km Mary considered it very fascinating work and was delighted with the result of her labor--a rug the exact imitation of one of the Professor's genuine Indian Navajo blankets, the work of her own hands. and without the expenditure of a penny.</p><p>Mary remarked : "I do not think all the triangles in my rug are the exact size of the paper pattern you made me, Aunt Sarah. The two in the centre appear larger than the others." </p><p>"Well," remarked her Aunt, "if you examine closely the blankets owned by Professor Schmidt, you will find the designs<pb n="062" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=84"/> on the ones woven by Navajo Indians are not of an equal size."</p><p>"Tis said Navajo blankets and Serapes will become scarce and higher in price in the future, on account of the numerous young Indians who have been educated and who prefer other occupations to that of weaving blankets, as did their forefathers; and the present disturbance in Mexico will certainly interfere with the continuance of this industry for a time.</p>

Don't you think that would be pretty, Aunt, Sarah?"</p>

"do tell me how that pretty little rug composed of silk scraps is made. </p><p>"Oh. that 
<emph rend="italic">silk</emph> rug: 'twas, given me by Aunt Cornelia, who finished it while here on a visit from New York. I never saw another like it, and it has been greatly admired. Although pos-sessed of an ordinary amount of patience, I don't think I'll ever make one of for myself. I don't admire knitted rugs of any description,<pb n="064" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=86"/> neither do I care for braided rugs. I think the crocheted ones prettier. But, Mary, this, small silk rug is easily made should you care to have one. I will commence knitting one for you at once. You will then find a use for the box of bright-colored silks you possess, many of which are quite too small to be used in any other manner. Professor Schmidt calls this a 'Prayer Rug.' He said: 'This rug. fashioned of various bright-lined silks of orange, purple and crimson, a bright maze of rich colors, without any recognizable figure or design. reminds me of the description of the "Prayer Carpel" or rugs of the Mohammedans. They are composed of rich-hued silks of purple. ruby and amber. "Tis said their delicacy of shade is marvelous and was suggested by the meadows of variegated flowers.' But this is a digression; you wished directions for making the rug.</p><p>"Use tiny scraps of various bright-hued silks, velvets and satins, cut about 3 1/2 inches long and about one-half inch in width. Ends should always he cut slanting or bias; never straight. All yon will require besides the silk scraps, will be a ball of common cord or twine, or save all cord which comes tied around packages, as I do, and use that and two ordinary steel knitting needles. When making her rug, Aunt Cornelia knitted several strips a couple of inches in width and the length she wished the finished rug to be. The strips when finished she sewed together with strong linen thread on the wrong side of the rug. She commenced the rug by knitting two rows of the twine or cord. (When I was a girl we called this common knitting 'garter stitch.) Then. when commencing to knit third row, slip off first stitch onto your other needle; knit one stitch, then lay one of the tiny scraps of silk across or between the two needles; knit one stitch with the cord. This holds the silk in position. Then fold or turn one end of silk back on the other piece of silk and knit one stitch of cord to hold them in place, always keeping silk on one side, on the top of rug, as this rug is not reversible. Continue in this manner until one row is finished. The knit once across plain with cord, and for next row lay silk scraps in and knit as before.

Mary, you will use judgement and tastein combining light and dark, bright and dull colors. Also, do not use several scraps of velvet together. Use velvet, silk and satin alternately. Should any<pb n="065" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=87"/> scraps of silk be longer than others after knitting trim off evenly so all will be of uniform size.

This way done to prevent the rug from curling up at edges, and caused it to lie flat on floor; but I think I should prefer just a firm lining or foundation of heavy burlap or denim."</p><p>"Thank you, Aunt Sarah, for your explicit directions. I cannot fail to know just how to knit a silk rug, should I ever care to do so. I think the work would be simply fascinating."</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XIII.</hd><hd align="center">THE GIRLS' CAMFIRE, ORGANIZED BY MARY.</hd><p>One day in early June, when all nature seemed aglow with happiness, we find Mary earnestly discussing with Elizabeth Schmidt the prosaic, humdrum life of many of the country girls, daughters of well-to-do farmers in the vicinity.</p><p>"I wish," said Mary, wrinking her forehead thoughtfully, "I could think of some new interest to introduce into their lives; some way of broadening their outlook; anything to bring more happiness into their commonplace daily toil; something good and helpful for them to think about."</p><p>All at once Mary, who was not usually demonstrative, clapped her hands, laughed gleefully and said:"I have it, Elizabeth. The very thing! Suppose we start a 'girls' campfire,' right here in the country? I don't think we shall have any trouble to organize."</p><p>"And you, because you understand all about it, will be the Guardian," said Elizabeth.</p><p>At first Mary demurred, but, overcome by Elizabeth's pleading, finally gave a reluctant consent. They then made out a list of the girls they thought might be willing to join, Mary promising to write at once for a handbook. They separated, Elizabeth to call to see the girls, and Mary to interview their parents. Their efforts were rewarded with surprisingly gratifying results, for many of the girls, and Mary to interview their parents. Their efforts were rewarded with surprisingly gratifying results, for many of the girls had read about the "Campfire Girls" and were anxious to become members.</p><p>One afternoon, several weeks later, had you gone into the old apple orchard, at the farm, you would have seen thirteen eager young girls, ranging in age from fourteen to sixteen listening intently to Mary, who was telling them about the "Camptire Girls." What she told them was something like this:</p><p>"Now girls, we are going to have a good time. Some of our good times will be play and some work. When you join, you will<pb n="067" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=89"/> become a 'Wood Gatherer,' and after three months' successful work, if you have met sertain qualifications, you will be promoted to the rank of 'Fire Maker.' Later on, when you come to realize what it means to be a 'Torch Bearer,' you will be put in that rank. The first law which you learn to follow is one which you must apply to your daily life. It is: Seek beauty, give service, pursue knowledge, be trustworthy, hold on to health, glorify work, be happy. 'The Camp Fire' has meant so much to girls'I have known, for their betterment, and has been so helpful in many ways, you surely will never regret becoming a member of the organization, or be anything but happy if you keep their laws. There will ne no dues, except the cost of your ceremonial costume, epaulettes and honor beads. The latter are quite inexpensive. The honors are divided into several classes, and for each honor a bead is given as symbol of your work. A special colored bead is given for each class. We shall meet about once every week. The monthly meeting is called the 'Council Fire.' I will tell you later about the 'Wohelo' ceremony. By the way, girls, 'Wohelo' stands for work, health and love. You see, the word is composed of the first two letters of each word."</p><p>The girls appeared to be greatly interested, and Mary felt very much encouraged. Some of the girls left to talk it over with the homefolks, while others, wishing to learn more of the organization, plied Mary with numerous questions. Finally, in desperation, she said: "Girls, I will read you the following from the 'Camp Fire Girls' Handbook, which I received this morning:</p><p>" 'The purpose of this organization is to show that the common things of daily life are the chief means of beauty, romance and adventure; to aid in the forming of habits making for health and vigor, the out-of-door habit and the out-of-door spirit; to devise ways of measuring and creating standards to woman's work, and to give girls the opportunity to learn how to "keep step," to learn team work, through doing it; to help girls and women serve the community, the larger home, in the same way they have always served the individual home; to give status and social recognition to the knowledge of the mother, and thus restore the intimate relationship of mothers and daughters to each other.'</p><p>"Well, girls," said Mary, as she laid aside the book. I think you all understand what a benefit this will be to you, and I will<pb n="068" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=90"/> do all in my power to help you girls, while I am at the farm this summer. It is too late to tell you any more today. The information I have given you will suffice for the present. Three cheers for our Camp Fire! which will be under way in two months, I trust."</p><p>The members of "Shawnee" Camp Fire held their first Council Fire, or Ceremonial Meeting, the second week in July. The girls, all deeply interested, worked hard to secure honors which were awarded for engaging in domestic duties well known to the home, for studying and observing the rules of hygiene and sanitation, and for learning and achievements in various ways. They held weekly meetings and studied diligently to win the rank of Fire Maker.</p><p>A girl, when she joins, becomes a Wood Gatherer; she then receives a silver ring.</p><p>The weeks pass swiftly by. and it is time for another Camp Fire. The girls selected as their meeting place for this occasion farmer Druckenmuller's peach orchard, to which they walked, a distance of about three miles from the home of Elizabeth Schmidt. They left about two o'clock in the afternoon, intending to return home before nightfall, a good time being anticipated, as they took with them lunch and materials for a corn-roast.</p><p>The peach orchard in question, covering many acres, was situated at the foot of a low hill. Between the two flowed an enchanting, fairy-like stream, the cultivated peach orchard on one side, and on the opposite side the forest-like hill, covered with an abundance of wild flowers.</p><p>When the afternoon set for the Council Fire arrived, had you happened to meet the fifteen merry, chattering girls, accompanied by two older girls. Mary and Lucy Robbins (the country school teacher), as chaperones, wending their way to the orchard, you, without a doubt, would have smiled and a question might naturally have arisen regarding their sanity. They certainly possessed intel-ligent faces, but why those queer-shaped Indian dresses? And such an awkward length for a young girl's dress! And why was their hair all worn hanging in one braid over each shoulder, with a band over the forehead ? Why so many strings of gaudy beads around their necks? These questions may all be answered in one<pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=91"/><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=92"/>

One of the girls stopped to examine a prickly-looking plant about two feel high. with 1ittle blue flowers growing along the stem, and asked if any one knew the name of it. They were about to look it up in a small "Flower Guide" owned by one of the girls. when some one said : "Why. that is a weed called 'Vipers Bougloss.'" They also found cardinal flower, thorn apple, monkey flower and jewel-weed in abundance, wild sunflower, ginseng, early goldenrod. "Joe-pie-weed," marshallow, black cohosh and purple 1oose-trifle. The girls also noticed various birds. </p><p>On a tall tree one of the girls espied a rose-breasted Grosbeak, care in this part of Bucks County. They all stopped and watched for a short time a white-bellied Nut-hatch. The girls were startled as a Scarlet Tanger flew past to join his mate, and they at last reached their rendezvous, the orchard.</p><p>By half-past three they were all seated in a circle waiting for the ceremonics to begin. Mary Midleton, their Guardian, stepped to the front, saying: "Sunflower. light the fire." Sunflower, through several months of daily attainment, had become a Fire-maker and was very proud of the Fire-maler's bracelet she was entitled to wear. Sunflower was given that name because she always looked on the bright side of everything ; she looked like a sunflower, too, with her tanned face and light. curly hair.</p><p>All the girls had symbolical names, given them. "Lark" was so named because of her sweet voice and because she loved to sing; "Sweet Tooth," on account of her love for candy; "Quick Silver." because she was quick, bright and witty; "Great Buffalo," a girl who was very strong; Elizabeth Schmidt, "Laughing Water." so named because she laughed and giggled at everybody and everything; "Babbling Brook." because it seemed an utter impossibility for her to stop talking; "Burr," because she sticks to ideas and friends; "Faith," quiet and reserved; "Comet," comes suddenly and brings a lot of light; "Black Hawk," always eager at first, but inclined to let her eagerness wear off: "Pocahontas,' because she never can hurry; Ginger Foot." a fiery temper; "Gypsy," so named on account of her black hair; "Bright Eyes," for her bright, blue eyes; "Rainbow." for her many ways, an because she is pretty.</p><pb n="070" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=94"/><p>As "Sunflower" took the matches and knelt by the pile of wood and lighted the fire, she recited the Ode to the Fire:</p><p>"Oh, Fire! Long years ago, when our fathers fought with great beasts, you were their protector. From the cruel cold of winter you saved. When they needed food, you changed the flesh of beasts into savory meat for them. Through all ages your mysterious flame has been a symbol of the Great Spirit to them. Tonight we light this lire in remembrance of the Great Spirit Who gave you to us."</p><p>Then the girls sang the chant or chanted:</p><p align="center">Wohelo for aye,<lb/>Wohelo for aye,<lb/>Wohelo for aye,<lb/>Wohelo for work,<lb/>Wohelo for health,<lb/>Wohelo,<lb/>Wohelo for love.</p><p>Then they recited the Wood-gatherer's Desire:</p><p>"It is my desire to be a Carnpfire Girl and keep the law of the Camp Fire, which is 'To Seek Beauty, Give Service, Pursue Knowledge, Be Trustworthy, Hold onto Health, Glorify Work. Be Happy.' "</p><p>None had yet attained the highest rank, that of Torch Bearer, won by still greater achievement, the Camp having been organized so recently. Their motto was "The light which has been given to me, I desire to pass undimmed to others."</p><p>"Gypsy," the secretary, then read the "Count" for the last meeting and called the roll, and the girls handed in the list of honors they had won in the last month. Some amused themselves playing games, while others gathered more wood.</p><p>At five o'clock the corn and white and sweet potatoes were in the fire roasting. A jolly circle of girls around the fire were busily engaged toasting "Weiners" for the feast, which was finally pronounced ready to be partaken of. The hungry girls "fell to" and even-thing eatable disappeared as if by magic; and last, but not least, was the toasting of marshmallows,'speared on the points of long, two-pronged sticks (broken from near-by trees). which were held over the fire until the marshmallows turned a delicate fawn<pb n="071" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=95"/> color. When everything had been eaten, with the exception of several cardboard boxes, corn cobs and husks, the girls quickly cleared up. Then, seated around the fire, told what they knew of Indian legends and folklore.</p><p>Noticing the sun slowly sinking in the West, they quickly gathered together their belongings and started homeward singing, "My Country, 'tis of Thee, Sweet Land of Liberty."</p><p>Thus broke up the second Council Fire, and in the heart of each girl was the thought of how much the Campfire was helping them to love God and His works.</p>

The process isvery simple. If you would have them very sweet, get the petals of the most fragnact rose. I used petals of the old-fashioned, pink 'hundred leaf' and 'blush rosed.' Gather a quantity, for you will need them all. Grind them to a pulp in the food chopper, repeat several times and place the pulp and juice into an iron kettle or pan. This turns the pulp black, which nothing but an iron kettle will do; cook, and when the consistency of dough, again as large as the size you wish your beads to be when finished, as they shrink in size when dried, and make them of uniform size, or larger ones for the centre of the necklace, as you prefer. Roll in the palms of your hands until perfectly round, stick a pin through each bead, then stick the pins into a bake board. He careful the bead does not touch the board, as that would spoil its shape. Allow the beads to remain until perfectly dry. If they are to have a dull finish, leave as they are. If you wish to polish them, take a tiny piece of vaseline on the palm of the hand and rub them between the palms until the vaseline is absorded. Then string them on a linen thread. Keep in a closed box to preserve their fragrance. Those I showed you, Mary. I them still.'"</p><p>"Did you know, Mary, that beads may be made from the petals of the common wild blue violet in exactly the same manner as they are made from rose leaves?"</p><p>"No, indeed, but I don't think the making of beads from the petals of roses and violets as wonderful as the beads which you raise in the garden. Those shiny, pearl-like seeds or beads of sil-very gray, called 'Job's Tears,' which grow on a stalk resembling<pb n="073" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=97"/> growing corn ; and to think Professor Schmidt raised those which Elizabeth strung on linen thread, alternately with beads, for a portiere in their sitting-room."</p><p>"Yes, my dear, the beads must be pierced before they become hard; later they should be polished. Did you ever see them grow Mary? The beads or 'tears' grow on a stalk about fifteen inches high and from the bead or 'tear' grows a tiny, green spear resembling oats. They are odd and with very little care may he grown in a small garden."</p><p>"They certainly are a curiosity," said Mary.</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XV.</hd><hd align="center">MARY AND ELIZABETH VISIT SADIE SINGMASTER.</hd><p>Farmer Landis, happening to mention at the breakfast table his intention of driving over to the "Ax Handle Factory" to obtain wood ashes to use as a fertilizer, his wife remarked, "Why not take Mary with you, John ? She can stop at Singmaster's with a basket of carpet rags for Sadie. I've been wanting to send them over for some time." Turning to Mary, she said: "Poor little, crippled Sadie! On account of a fall, which injured her spine, when a small child, she has been unable to walk for years. She cuts and sews carpet rags, given her by friends and neighbors, and from their sale to a carpet weaver in a near-by town, helps her widowed mother eke out her small income."</p><p>"I'd love to go see her." said Mary. Elizabeth Schmidt also expressed her willingness to go, when asked, saying: "I am positive mother will add her contribution to the carpet rags for Sadie. I do pity her so very much."</p><p>"Yes," said Mary's Aunt, "she is poor and proud. She will not accept charity, so we persuade her to take carpet rags, as we have more than we can possibly use."</p><p>On reaching the Singmaster cottage, the girls alighted with their well-filled baskets, Mary's Uncle driving on to the "Ax Handle Factory," promising to call for the girls on his return. The sad, brown eyes of Sadie, too large for her pinched, sallow face, shone with pleasure at sight of the two young girls so near her own age, and she smiled her delight on examining the numerous bright-colored patches brought by them. Thinking the pleasure she so plainly showed might appear childish to the two girls, she explained: "I do get so dreadfully tired sewing together so many dull, homely rags. I shall enjoy making balls of these pretty, bright colors."</p><p>"Sadie." Mary inquired, "will you think me inquisitive should I ask what the carpet weaver pays you for the rags when you have sewed and wound them into balls?" </p><pb n="075" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=99"/><p>"Certainly not," replied Sadie. "Four cents a pound is what he pays me. It takes two of these balls to make a pound," and she held up a ball she had just finished winding.</p><p>"Is 
<emph rend="italic">that all</emph> you get?" exclaimed Elizabeth.</p><p>"Have you ever made rag rugs?" inquired Mary.</p><p>"No. I have never even seen one. Are they anything like braided mats?"</p><p>"Yes, they are somewhat similar to them, but I crochet mine and think them prettier. I have made several, with Aunt Sarah's assistance. I'll come over and teach you to make them one of these days, should you care to learn, and I'm positive you will find ready sale for them. In fact. I've several friends in the city who have admired the ones I have, and would like to buy rugs for the Colonial rooms they are furnishing. Sadie, can you crochet?"</p><p>"Oh, yes. I can do the plain stitch very well."</p><p>"That is all that will be necessary. You will become very much interested in inventing new designs, it is very fascinating work, and it will be more remunerative than sewing carpet rags. Aunt Sarah will send you more carpet rags if you require them, and should you wish dull colors of blue or pink, a small package of dye will transform white or light-colored rags into any desired shade, to match the furnishings of different rooms. I think the crocheted rugs much prettier than the braided ones, which are so popular in the 'Nutting' pictures, and the same pretty shades may he used when rugs are crocheted."</p><p>When Fanner Landis came for the girls, he found them too busily engaged talking to hear his knock at the door. During the drive home Mary could think and talk of nothing but Sadie Sing-master, and the rugs she had promised to teach her to make at an early day. Elizabeth, scarcely less enthusiastic, said : "I've a lot of old things I'll give her to cut up for carpet rags."</p><p>Reaching home, Mary could scarcely wait an opportunity to tell Aunt Sarah all her plans for Sadie's betterment. When she finally did tell her Aunt, she smiled and said: "Mary, I'm not surprised.You are always planning to do a kind act for some one. You remind me of the lines, 'If I Can Live,' by Helen Hunt Jackson."

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XVI.</hd><hd align="center">THE OLD PARLOR MADE BEAUTIFUL (MODERNIZED).</hd><p>When John Landis came into possession of "Clear Spring" Farm, where his mother had lived during her lifetime, she having inherited it from her father, the rooms of the old farm house were filled with quaint, old-fashioned furniture of every description. "Aunt Sarah," on coming to the farm to live, had given a personal touch and cheery, homelike look to every room in the house, with one exception, the large, gloomy, old-fashioned parlor, which was cold, cheerless and damp. She confessed to Mary she always felt as if John's dead-and-gone ancestors' ghostly presences inhabited . the silent room. The windows were seldom opened to allow a ray of sunlight to penetrate the dusk with which the room was always enveloped, except when the regular weekly sweeping day arrived; when, after being carefully swept and dusted, it was promptly closed. A room every one avoided, Aunt Sarah was very particular about always having fresh air and sunlight in every other part of the house but his one room. The old fireplace had been boarded up many years before Aunt Sarah's advent to the farm, so it could not be used. One day Mary noticed, while dusting the room (after it had been given a thorough sweeping by Sibylla, Aunt Sarah's one maid servant), that the small, many-paned windows facing the East, at one end of the parlor, when opened, let in a flood of sunshine; and in the evening those at the opposite end of the long room gave one a lovely view of the setting sun-a finer picture than any painted by the hand of a master. Mary easily persuaded her Aunt to make some changes in the unlivable room. She suggested that they consult her Uncle about repapering and painting the room and surprise him with the result when finished. </p><p>Aunt Sarah who never did things by halves, said : Mary, I have long intended 'doing over' this room, but thought it such a great undertaking. Now, with your assistance, I shall make a dean sweep of these old, antiquated heirlooms of a past generation.<pb n="078" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=102"/> This green carpet, with its gorgeous bouquets of roses, we shall have combined with one of brown and tan in the attic. Your Uncle shall take them with him when he drives to town and have them woven into pretty, serviceable rugs for the floor."</p><p>"And, oh! Aunt Sarah," cried Mary, "do let's have an open fireplace. It makes a room so cheery and 'comfy' when the weather gets colder, on long winter evenings, to have a fire in the grate. I saw some lovely, old brass andirons and fender in the attic, and some brass candlesticks there also, which will do nicely for the mantel shelf over the fireplace. I'll shine 'em up, and instead of this hideously-ugly old wall paper with gay-colored scrawley figures, Aunt Sarah, suppose we get an inexpensive, plain, tan felt paper for drop ceiling and separate it from the paper on the side wall, which should be a warm, yellow-brown, with a narrow chestnut wood molding. Then this dull, dark, gray-blue painted woodwork; could any one imagine anything more hideously ugly? It gives me the 'blues' simply to look at it. Could we not have it painted to imitate chestnut wood? And don't you think we might paint the floor around the edges of the rug to imitate the woodwork? Just think of those centre panels of the door painted a contrasting shade of pale pink. The painter who did this work certainly was an artist. A friend of mine in the city, wishing to use rugs instead of carpets on her floors, and not caring to go to the expense of laying hardwood floors, gave the old floors a couple of coats of light lemon.or straw-colored paint, then stained and grained them a perfect imitation of chestnut, at small expense. The floors were greatly admired when finished, and having been allowed to dry thoroughly after being varnished, proved quite durable. I will write to rny friend at once and ask her exactly how her floors were treated."</p><p>"Now, Mary, about this old-style furniture. The old grandfather clock standing in the corner, at the upper end of the room, I should like to have remain. It is one hundred and fifty years old and belonged to my folks, and, although old-fashioned, is highly valued by me."</p><p>"Of course," said Mary, "we'll certainly leave that in the room." </p><p>"Also," said Aunt Sarah, "allow the old cottage organ and large, old-fashioned bookcase belonging to your Uncle to remain. He has frequently spoken of moving his bookcase into the next<pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=103"/><pb n="list of illustrations" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=104"/>

We will move Uncle John in here, near the bookcase, when we get our room fixed up. Aunt Sarah, we will leave that old-fashioned table, also with one leaf up against the wall. and this quaint, little, rush-bottomed rocker, which I just dote on."</p><p>"Why, dear," exclaimed Aunt Sarah, "there are several chairs to match it in the attic, which you may have when you start housekeeping for your very own. And," laughingly, said her Aunt, "there is another old, oval, marble-topped table in the attic, containing a large glass case covering a basket of wax fruit, which you may have."</p><p>"No, Aunt Sarah," said Mary, "I don't believe I want the fruit, but I will accept your offer of the table. Well, Aunt Sarah, 1 know you won't have this old, black what-not standing in the corner of the room. I do believe it is made of spools, strung on wire, as supports for the shelves; then all painted black, imitation of ebony, 1 suppose. It must have been made in the Black Age, at the same time the old corner cupboard was painted, as Uncle John told me he scraped off three different layers of paint before doing it over, and one was black. It was originally made of cherry. It certainly looks fine now, with those new brass hinges and pretty, old-fashioned glass knobs."</p><p>"Yes, Mary," replied her Aunt, "and there is an old corner cupboard in the attic which belonged to my father, that you may have, and, with a very little labor and expense, Ralph can make it look as well as mine. It has only one door and mine possesses two."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah," exclaimed Mary, "you are a dear! How will I ever repay you for all your kindness to me?"</p><p>"By passing it on to some one else when you find some one-needing help," said Aunt Sarah. </p><p>"Such a collection of odd things, Aunt Sarah, as are on this what-not I never saw. Old ambrotypes and daguerreotypes of gone and forgotten members of the 'freinshoft,' as you sometimes. say. I don't believe you know any of them."</p><p>"Yes, the red plush frame on the mantel shelf contains a pic-lure of John's Uncle, a fine-looking man. but he possessed 'Wanderlust' and has lived in California for many years.</p><pb n="080" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=106"/><p>"Oh, you mean the picture on the mantel standing near those twin gilded china vases, gay with red and blue paint?"</p><p>"Yes; and that small china and gilt stand with little bowl and pitcher was given me when a small child."</p><p>"Suppose I bring a basket and we will fill it with articles from the mantel and what-not," said Mary, "and cany them all to the attic, until you have a rummage sale some day. We'll burn these 'everlasting, and 'straw' flowers, and pampas grass, and this large apple stuck full of cloves. Here is a small china dog and a little china basket with a plaited china handle decorated with gilt, and tiny, pink-tinted china roses. And these large, glass marbles containing little silver eagles inside; also this small, spun-glass ship and blue-and-pink-striped glass pipe. Aunt Sarah, some of you: ancestors must have attended a glass blowers' exhibition in years past."</p><p>"This branch of white coral, these large snail shells (when a ling the roar of the ocean), and this small basket, fashioned of twigs and tendrils of grape vine, then dipped in red sealing wax, certainly is a good imitation of coral, and this plate, containing a miniature ship composed of green postage stamps, we will place in your corner cupboard."</p><p>"And, Aunt Sarah, I suppose this deep, glass-covered picture frame containing a bouquet of hair flowers, most wonderfully and fearfully made, was considered a work of art in days past and gone, as was also the crescent in a frame on the opposite side of the room, composed of flowers made of various seeds of grain and garden vegetables. Those daisies, made of cucumber seeds with grains of red corn for centres, and those made of tiny grains of popcorn with a watermelon seed in centre, are cute. The latter look like breastpins with a circle of pearls around the edge. And this glass case on the table, containing a white cross, covered with wax tube roses, ivy leaves, and fuchsias drooping from the arms Of the cross, sparkling with diamond dust! The band of green Chenille around its base matches the mat underneath, composed of green zephyr of different shades, knitted, then raveled to imitate moss, I suppose; and, no doubt, this marble-topped table has stood here for fifty years, in this same spot, lor the express purpose of holding this beautiful (?) work of art."</p><pb n="081" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=107"/><p>"The hair flowers and the seed wreath were made by John's sister." replied Aunt Sarah.</p><p>"Aunt Sarah," exclaimed Mary, "I've an original idea. This oval, marble-topped table has such strong, solid legs of black waltop made of wood at the planing mill? Wait; I'll get my tape measure. About thirty-two inches in diameter will do. The new top we shall stain to match the walnut frame, and it could be easily fastened to the table with a couple of screws; and, after the marble top has been well scoured, we'll use it in the kitchen as a bake board on which to roll out pic crust."</p><p>Her Aunt as usual acquiesced to all Mary's suggestions.</p><p>"You're a dear, Aunt Sarah!" exclaimed Mary, as she gave her a hug. "and I'll embroider big, yellow daisies with brown centres of French knots on gray linen for a new table cover. Won't they look just sweet?"</p><p>"Yes, Mary, and I'll buy a large, new lamp with a pretty shade, as I feel sure your Uncle will like to sit here evenings to read his papers and farm journals."</p><p>"And don't forget the Shriners' little magazine, 
<emph rend="italic">The Crescent</emph>, which amuses him so greatly. Aunt Sarah, I do wish those stiff, starchy-looking, blue-white Nottingham lace curtains at the windows had grown yellow with age. They would be ever so much prettier and softer looking, and they are such a pretty, neat design, too."</p><p>"Oh!" replied her Aunt, "that may be easily remedied. I'll just dip them into a little weak liquid coffee and that will give them a creamy tint, and take out the stiffness."</p><p>"Now," said Mary, "what shall we do with these stiff, ugly, haircloth-covered chairs and sofa?"</p><p>"Why," replied Aunt Sarah, "we shall buy cretonne or art cloth, in pretty shades of brown and tan or green, to harmonize with the wall paper, and make slip covers for them all. We could never think of dispensing with the sofa. It is a very important article of furniture in German households. The hostess usually gives the person of greatest distinction among her guests the place of honor beside her on the sofa."</p><p>"These chairs have such strong, well-made, mahogany frames it would be a pity not to use them. Now," continued Mary, "about the pictures on the wall. Can't we consign them all to the<pb n="082" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=108"/> attic? We might use some of the frames. I'll contribute unframed copies of 'The Angelus' and 'The Gleaners,' by Millet; and I think they would fit into these plain mahogany frames which contain the very old-fashioned set of pictures named respectively 'The Lovers,' 'The Declaration, 'The Lovers' Quarrel and 'The Marriage.' They constitute a regular art gallery. I'll use a couple of the frames for some small Colonial and apple blossom pictures I have, that I just love, by Wallace Nutting. Mine are all unframed; 'Maiden Reveries,' 'A Canopied Roof and a 'Ton of Bloom,' I think are sweet. Those branches of apple trees, covered with a mass of natural-looking pink blossoms, are exquisite."</p><p>"Yes," remarked Aunt Sarah, "they look exactly like our old Baldwin, Winesap and Cider apple trees in the old, south meadow in the Spring, And, Mary, we'll discard those two chromos, popular a half century ago, of two beautiful cherubs called respect-iveiy, 'Wide Awake' and 'Fast Asleep,' given as premiums to a popular magazine. I don't remember if the magazine was 'Godey's,' 'Peterson's or 'Home Queen'; they have good, plain, mahogany frames which we can use."</p><p>"And, Aunt Sarah," said Mary,"we can cut out the partition in this large, black-walnut frame, containing lithograph pictures of General George Washington, 'the Father of his Country' (we are informed in small letters at the bottom of the picture), and of General Andrew Jackson, 'the hero of New Orleans.' Both men are pictured on horseback, on gayly-caparisoned, prancing white steeds, with scarlet saddle cloth, edged with gold bullion fringe. The Generals are pictured clad in blue velvet coats with white facings of cloth or satin vest and tight-fitting knee breeches, also white and long boots reaching to the knee. Gold epaulettes are on their shoulders, and both are in the act of lifting their old-fashioned Continental hats, the advancing army showing faintly in the background. How gorgeously they are arrayed! We will use this frame for the excellent, large copy you have of 'The Doctor' and the pictured faces of the German composers-Beethoven, Wagner, Mendelssohn, Haydn, Schubert and Mozart, which I nave on a card with a shaded brown background will exactly fit into this plain frame of narrow molding, from which I have just removed the old cardboard motto 'No place like home,' done with green-shaded zephyr in cross-stitch."</p><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=109"/><pb n="list of illustrations" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=110"/>

</illustration><pb n="083" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=111"/><p>"Now, Mary, with the couple of comfortable rockers which I intend purchasing, I think we have about finished planning out room."</p><p>"If you are willing, Aunt Sarah, I should like to make some pretty green and brown cretonne slips to cover those square sofa pillows in place of the ones made of small pieces of puffed silk and the one of colored pieces of cashmere in log cabin design. I do admire big, fat, plain, comfortable pillows, for use instead of show. And we must have a waste paper basket near the table beside Uncle John's chair. I shall contribute green satin ribbon for an immense bow on the side of the basket. Oh! Aunt Sarah ! You've forgotten all about this odd, woven basket, beside the what-not, filled with sea shells. I don't care for the shells, but the basket would make a lovely sewing basket."</p><p>"You may have the basket, Mary, if you like it. It came from Panama, or perhaps it was bought at Aspinwall by John's Uncle, many years ago, when he carne home on a visit from California, by way of the Isthmus, to visit old friends and relatives. John's Mother always kept it standing on the floor in one corner of the room beside the what-not."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, why was straw ever put under this carpet?"</p><p>"The straw was put there, my dear, to save the carpet, should the boards on the floor be uneven. My Mother was always particular about having cut rye straw, because it was softer and finer than any other. It was always used in those days instead of the carpet linings we now have. I remember sometimes, when the carpet had been newly laid, in our home, immediately after house cleaning time the surface of the floor looked very odd; full of bumps and raised places in spots, until frequent walking over it flattened down the straw This room happens to have a particularly good, even floor, as this part of the house was built many vears later than the original, old farm house, else it would not do to have it painted."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, may I have the old spinning wheel in the attic? I'd love to furnish an old Colonial bedroom when I have a home of my very own. I'll use the rag carpet you made me for the floor, the old-fashioned, high-post bed Uncle John said I might have, and the 'New Colonial' rugs you taught me to make."</p><p>"Yes, my dear, and there is another old grandfather's clock<pb n="084" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=112"/> in the attic which you may have; and a high-boy also, for which I have no particular use."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, we shall not put away this really beautiful old sampler worked in silk by Uncle John's grandmother when a girl of nine years. It is beautifully done, and is wonderful, I think. And what is this small frame containing a yellowed piece of paper cut in intricate designs, presumably with scissors?"</p><p>"Look on the back of the picture and see what is written there, my dear," said her Aunt.</p><p>Mary slowly read:" This is the only picture I owned before my marriage. I earned the money to buy it by gathering wheat heads.' "</p><p>"It belonged to my grandmother," said Aunt Sarah. "In old times, after the reapers had left the field, the children were allowed to gather up the wheat remaining. and, I suppose, grandmother bought this picture with the money she earned herself, and considered it quite a work of art in her day. It is over one hundred years old."</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XVII.</hd><hd align="center">AN OLD SONG EVENING</hd><p>Aunt Sarah and Mary spent few idle moments while carrying out their plans for "doing over" the old parlor. Finally, 'twas finished. Mary breathed a sigh of satisfaction as the last picture was hung on the wall. She turned to her Aunt, saying, "Don't you think the room looks bright, cheery and livable?"</p><p>"Yes," replied her Aunt," and what is more essential, homey, I have read somewhere, 'A woman's house should be as personal a matter as a spider's web or a snail's shell; and all the thought, toil and love she puts into it should be preserved a part of its comeliness and homelikeness forever, and be her monument to the generations."</p><p>"Well, Aunt Sarah," replied Mary, "I guess we've earned our monument. The air that blows over the fields, wafted in from the open window, is sweet with the scent of grain and clover, and certainly is refreshing. I'm dreadfully tired, but so delighted with the result of our labors. Now we will go and 'make ready,' as Sibylla says, before the arrival of Ralph from the city. I do hope the ice cream will be frozen hard. The Sunshine Sponge Cake, which I baked from a recipe the Professor's wife gave me. is light as a feather. 'Tis Ralph's favorite cake. Lets see; besides Ralph there are coming all the Schmidts Lucy Robbins. the school teacher, and Sibylla entertains her Jake in the kitchen. I promised to treat him to ice cream; Sibylla was so good about helping me crack the ice to use for freezing the cream. We shall have an 'Old Song Evening' that will amuse every one."</p><p>Quite early as is the custom in the country, the guests for the evening arrived ; and both Mary and Aunt Sarah felt fully repaid for their hard work of the past weeks by the pleasure John Land evinced at the changed appearance of the room. </p><p>The Professor's wife said, "It scarcely seems possible to have changed the old room so completely."</p><pb n="086" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=114"/><p>Aunt Sarah replied, "Paint and paper do wonders when combined with good taste, furnished by Mary."</p><p>During the evening one might have been forgiven for thinking Professor Schmidt disloyal to the Mother Country (he having been born and educated in Heidelberg) had you overheard him speaking to Ralph on his favorite subject, the "Pennsylvania German." During a lull in the general conversation in the room Mary heard the Professor remark to Ralph: "The Pennsylvania Germans are a thriftly, honest and industrious class of people, many of whom have held high offices. The first Germans to come to America as colonists in Pennsylvania were, as a rule, well to do. Experts, when examining old documents of Colonial days, after counting thousands of signatures, found the New York 'Dutch' and the Pennsylvania 'German' were above the average in education in those days. Their dialect, the so-called 'Pennsylvania German' or 'Dutch,' as it is erroneously called by many, is a dialect which we find from the Tauber Grund to Frankfurt, A. M. As the German language preponderated among the early settlers, the language of different elements, becoming amalgamated, formed a class of people frequently called 'Pennsylvania Dutch'."</p><p>Professor Harbaugh, D.D., has written some beautiful poems in Pennsylvania German which an eminent authority, Professor Kluge, a member of the Freiburg University, Germany, has thought worthy to be included among the classics. They are almost identical with the poems written by Nadler in Heidel-berger Mundart, or dialect.</p><p>Mary, who had been listening intently to the Professor, said, when he finished talking to Ralph: "Oh, please, do repeat one of Professor Harbaugh's poems for us."</p><p>He replied, "I think I can recall several stanzas of 'Das Alt Schulhaus an der Krick.' Another of Professor Harbaugh's poems, and I think one of the sweetest I have ever read, is "Heemweeh.' Both poems are published in his book entitled 'Harbaugh's Harfe,' in Pennsylvania German dialect, and possess additional interest from the fact that the translations of these poems, in the latter part of the same book, were made by the author himself." </p><p>"Oh, do repeat all that you remember of both the poems," begged Mary.</p><p>The Professor consented, saying; "As neither you nor Mr. Jackson understand the Pennsylvania German dialect, I shall<pb n="087" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=115"/> translate them for you, after repeating what I remember 'Heem-week means Homesickness, but first I shall give you 'Das Alt Schulhaus an der Krick'."</p><hd align="center">*DAS ALT SCHULHAUS AN DER KRICK.</hd><p align="center">Heit is 's 'xactly zwansig Johr,<lb/>Dass ich bin owwe naus;<lb/>Nau bin ich widder lewig z'rick<lb/>Un schteh am Schulhaus an d'r Krick,<lb/>Juscht neekscht an's Dady's Haus.</p><p align="center">Ich bin in hunnert Heiser g'west,<lb/>Vun Marbelstee' un Brick,<lb/>Un alles was sie hen, die Leit.<lb/>Dhet ich verschwappe cenig Zeit<lb/>For's Schulhaus an der Krick.</p><p align="center">Der Weisseech schteht noch an der Dhier-<lb/>Macht Schatte iwwer's Dach:<lb/>Die Drauwerank is ah noch grie'-<lb/>Un's Amschel-Nescht-guk juscht mol hi'-<lb/>O was is dess en Sach!</p><p align="center">Do bin ich gange in die Schul,<lb/>Wo ich noch war gans klce';<lb/>Dort war der Meeschter in seim Schtuhl,<lb/>Dort war sei' Wip, un dort sei' Ruhl,-<lb/>Ich kann's noch Alles seh'.</p><p align="center">Die lange Desks rings an der Wand-<lb/>Die grose Schieler drum;<lb/>Uf eener Seit die grose Mad,<lb/>Un dort die Buwe net so bleed-<lb/>Guk, wic sie piepe rum !</p><pb n="088" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=116"/><p align="center">Oh horcht, ihr Leit, wu nooch mir lebt,<lb/>Ich schreib eich noch des Schtick:<lb/>Ich warn eich, droll eich, gebt doch Acht,<lb/>Un memmt uf immer gut enacht,<lb/>Des Schulhaus an der Krick!</p><hd align="center">THE OLD SCHOOL-HOUSE AT THE CREEK.</hd><p align="center">Today it is just twenty years,<lb/>Since I began to roam;<lb/>Now, safely back, I stand once more,<lb/>Before the quaint old school-house door,<lb/>Close by my father's home.</p><p align="center">I've been in many house since,<lb/>Of marble built, and brick;<lb/>Though grander far, their aim they miss,<lb/>To lure heart's old love from this<lb/>Old school-house at the creek.</p><p align="center">The white-oak stands before the door,<lb/>And shades the roof at noon;<lb/>The grape-vine, too, is fresh and green;<lb/>The robin's nest!-Ah, hark!-I ween<lb/>That is the same old tune!</p><p align="center">'Twas here I first attended school<lb/>When I was very small;<lb/>There was the Master on his stool,<lb/>There was his whip and there his rule-<lb/>I seem to see it all.</p><p align="center">The long desks ranged along the walls,<lb/>With books and inkstands crowned;<lb/>Here on this side the large girls sat,<lb/>And there the tricky hoys on that-<lb/>See!

"The Lost Chord" and "Better Bide a Wee."</p><p>The Professor then asked his daughter Elizabeth to give them the music of a song from German Volkslied, or Folk Song, with the words of which all except Mary and Ralph were familiar. Professor Schmidt sang in his high, cracked voice to Elizabeth's accompaniment the words of the German song, beginning:</p><p align="indent2">Du, Du liegest mir in Herzen<lb/>Du, Du liegst mir in Sinn<lb/>Du, Du machst mir vicl Schmerzen<lb/>Weist nicht wie gut ich Dir binn<lb/>Ja, ja, ja, ja, Du weist nicht wie gut ich Dir bin.</p><p>The young folks all joined in the chorus. Fritz Schmidt asked Elizabeth to play "Polly Wolly Doodle" for little Pollykins, which Fritz sang with gusto. Fritz then sang the rollicking German song, "Lauderbach," to an accompaniment played by Mary, and followed by singing "Johnny Schmoker," with appropriate gesttures in the chorus commencing "My Pilly, Willy Wink, das is mein fifa," etc., ending with "My fal. lal, lal, my whach, whach, das ist mein doodle soch," which he emphasized by shrugging his shoulders, to the no small enjoyment of the young floks, who thought the silly, old German song no end of fun. This was followed by a favorite college song, "Mandalay," by Fritz.</p><p>Then Elizabeth Schmidt played and sang a pretty little German song called "Meuhlen Rad," meaning The Mill Wheel, taught her by her mother. </p><hd align="center">MEUHLEN RAD.</hd><p align="center">In einen kuhlen grunde<lb/>Da steht ein meuhlen rad;<lb/>Mein libste ist versch wunden,<lb/>Die dort gcwhoned hat:<lb/>Sie hat mir treu versprochen,<lb/><pb n="094" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=122"/> Gab ihr cin ring dabei;<lb/>Sie hat die treu gebrochen,<lb/>Das ringlein sprang entzwei.</p><p>She translated it for the benefit of Ralph and Mary: "In a cool, pleasant spot, stands a mill. My loved one, who lived there, has disappeared. She promised to be true to me, and I gave her a ring. She broke her promise and the ring broke in two."</p><p>Fritz then caught his little sister Pauline around the waist and waltzed her to one end of the long room, saying: "Mary, play the piece, Tut On Your Old Gray Bonnet,' and Pollykins and I will do the cakewalk For you."</p><p>Polly, who bad become quite a proficient little dancer under her sister's teaching, was very willing to do her share in the evening's entertainment, and it was pronounced a decided success.</p><p>Mary then said, "I'll play my favorite schottische, composed by our old friend, the Professor. I have not yet procured a copy of his latest piece of music, 'The Passing of the Dahlias.' I think it is still with the publishers."</p><p>Mary, after playing "Rock of Ages," left the room to see about serving refreshments. when Elizabeth Schmidt took her place at the instrument. After playing "The Rosary," she turned to Ralph, who had been greatly amused by the German songs on the program, all of which were quite new to him. and said: "What shall I play for you?"</p><p>He replied.'" 'My little Irish Rose'-no, I mean 'The River Shannon.'"</p><p>"Don't you mean 'That Grand Old Name Called Mary?'" mischievously inquired Fritz Schmidt, who could not refrain from teasing Ralph, which caused a laugh at his expense, as all present were aware of his love for Mary. Elizabeth, to cover Ralph's confusion. quickly replied: "I'll play my favorite 'The End of a Perfect Day.'" </p><p>The party was pronounced a success, and broke up at a late hour for country folks. Before leaving, Mary's Uncle said:"Now, let's sing 'Home Sweet Home.' and then all join in singing that grand old hymn. 'My Country. 'Tis of Thee,''to the new tune by our friend, the Bucks County Editor"</p><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=123"/><pb n="introduction" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=124"/>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XVIII.</hd><hd align="center">A VISIT TO THE "PENNSYLVANIA PALISADES," AS THE "NARROWS" OF THE DELAWARE RIVER ARE CALLED.</hd><p>All hailed with delight Aunt Sarah's proposal that the Schmidt and Landis families, on the Fourth of July, drive over to the Narrows, visit Aunt Sarah's old home at Nockamixon, and see the "Ringing Rocks" and "High Falls." situated a short distance from the rocks, near which place picnics were frequently held. John Landis readily agreed to the proposed plan, saying, "The meadow hay and clover art cut. and I'll not cut the wheat until the fifth day of July."</p><p>The third of July was a busy day at both farm houses, preparing savory food of every description with which to fill hampers for the next day's outing. Small Polly Schmidt was so perfectly happy, at the thought of a proposed picnic, she could scarcely con-tain herself. and as her sister Elizabeth said, "did nothing but get in every way." Little Polly, being easily offended, trudged over to the Landis farm to see Mary, with whom she knew she was a great favorite.</p><p>The morning of the Fourth dawned bright and clear. Quite early, while the earth was still enveloped in a silvery mist, and on the lattice work of filmy cobwebs, spun over weeds and grass,dewdrops, like any diamonds sparkled and glistened. until dissolved by the sun's warm rays, the gay party left home for the "Palisades" were quite a distance from the farm, to drive being the only way of reaching the place, unless one boarded the gaso-line motorcar, called the "Carmicht? Express" by farmers living in the vicinity of Schuggenhaus Township.</p><p>There is something indescribably exhilarating about starting for an early drive in the country before sunrise on a bright, clear morning in midsummer when the earth is awaking. the sky and the ocean, the river and forest, the mountain and plain." Who has not felt the sweet freshness of early morning before "the sunshine is all on the wing" or the birds awaken and begin to chatter and<pb n="096" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=126"/> to sing? There is a hush over everything; later is heard the low-ing of cattle, the twitter of birds and hum of insect life, proclaim-ing the birth of the new day. Passing an uncultivated field, over-grown with burdock, wild carrots, mullein, thistle and milk weed, Mary alighted and gathered some of the pods of the latter, inclos-ing imitation of softest down, which she used later for filling sofa pillows.</p><p>"Look at those pretty wild canaries!" exclaimed Aunt Sarah, "yellow as gold, swinging on the stem of a tall weed."</p><p>"Professor Schmidt, can you tell me the name of that weed?" questioned Mary. "I have always admired the plant, with its large leaves and long, drooping racemes of crimson seeds.</p><p>"That," replied the Professor, "is a foreign plant, a weed called Equisetum from 'Equi,' a horse, and 'Seturn'-tail. The country folk hereabout call it 'Horsetail.' It belongs to the Crptogamous or flowerless plants. There are only four specimens of this plant in America. I, too, have always greatly admired the plant."</p><p>The Professor was quite a noted botanist. There were few flowers, plants or weeds of which he was ignorant of the name or medicinal value. Another bird lazily picked seeds from the thistle blossoms. "See," exclaimed Aunt Sarah, "one bird has a spear of grass in its mouth!"</p><p>"Yellow star grass," said the Professor, "with which to make a nest. They never mate until the last of June, or first part of July. The tiny, little robbers ate up nearly all my sunflower seeds in the garden last summer."</p><p>"Well," replied Mary, "you know, Professor, the birds must have food. They are the farmer's best friend. I hope you don't begrudge them a few sunflower seeds. I love birds. I particularly admire the 'Baltimore Oriole,' with their brilliant, orange-colored plumage; they usually make their appearance simultaneously with the blossoms in the orchard in the south meadow; or so Aunt Sarah tells me. I love to watch them lazily swinging on the high branches of tall trees. On the limb of a pear tree in the orchard one day, I saw firmly fastened a long, pouch-like nest, woven with rare skill. Securely fastened to the nest by various colored pieces of twine and thread was one of smaller size, like a lean-to added to a house as if the original nest had been found too small to accommodate the family of young birds when hatched.<pb n="097" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=127"/> The oriole possesses a peculiar, sweet, high-whistled trill, similiar to this-"La-la-la-la,' which always ends with the rising inflection."</p><p>Fritz Schmidt, who had been listening intently to Mary, gravely remarked, "An oriole built a nest on a tall tree outside my bedroom window, and early every morning, before the family arise, I hear it sing over and over again what sounds exactly like 'Lais Die Beevil!' which translated means 'Read your Bible'."</p><p>"Even the birds are 'Dutch,' I believe, in Bucks County," said Fritz. "I think these must be German Mennonites, there being quite a settlement of these honest, God-fearing people living on farms at no great distance from our place."</p>

</illustration><p>As they drove along the country road, parallel with the Delaware River, just before reaching the Narrows, Mary was greatly attracted by the large quantities of yellow-white "sweet clover," a weed-like plant found along the Delaware River, frowing luxuriantly, with tall, waving stems two or four feet high. The clover-like flowers, in long, loose racemes, terminating the branches, were so fragant that, like the yellow evening primrose, the scent was noticeable long before one preceived the flowers. And, strange to tell, sweet slover was never known to grow in this locality until the seed was washed up on the bank of the<pb n="098" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=128"/> river some ten or twelve years previous to the date of my story, when the Delaware River was higher than it was ever before known to be.</p><p>"The first place we shall visit," said Aunt Sarah, "will be my grandmother's old home, or rather, the ruins of the old home. It passed out of our family many years ago; doors and windows are missing and walls ready to tumble down. You see that old locust tree against one side the ruined wall of the house?" and with difficulty she broke a branch from the tree saying, "Look, see the sharp, needle-shaped thorns growing on the branch! They were used by me when a child to pin my dolls' dresses together. In those days, pins were too costly to use; and look at that large, flat rock not far distant from the house! At the foot of that rock, when a child of ten, I buried the 'Schild Krote Family' dolls, made from punk (when told I was too big a girl to play with dolls). I shed bitter tears, I remember. Alas! The sorrows of childhood are sometimes deeper than we of maturer years realize."</p><p>"Why did you give your family of dolls such an odd name, Aunt Sarah?" questioned Mary.</p><p>"I do not remember," replied her Aunt. "Schild Krote is the German name for turtle. I presume the name pleased my childish fancy."</p><p>"Suppose we visit my great-great-grandfather's grave in the near-by woods. I think I can locale it, although so many years have passed since I last visited it."</p><p>Passing through fields overgrown with high grass, wild flowers and clover, they came to the woods. Surprising to say, scarcely any underbrush was seeen, but trees everywhere-stately Lebanon cedars, spruce and spreading hemlock, pin oaks, juniper trees which later would be covered with spicy, aromatic berries; also beech trees. Witch hazel and hazel nut bushes grew in profusion. John Landis cut a large branch from a sassafras tree to make a new spindle on which to wind flax, for Aunt Sarah's old spinning wheel (hers having been broken), remarking as he did as, "My mother always used a branch of sassafras wood, having five, prong-like branches for this purpose, when I was a boy, and she always placed a piece of sassafras root with her dried fruit."</p><p>The Professor's wife gathered an armful of yarrow, saying, "This is an excellent tonic and should always be gathered before<pb n="099" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=129"/> the flowers bloom. I wonder if there is any boneset growing anywhere around here."</p><p>Boneset, a white, flowering, bitter herb, dearly beloved and used by the professor's wife as one of the commonest home remedies in case of sickness, and equally detested by both Fritz and Pauline.</p>

Mary's Uncle could not agree with her in praise of the dainty wild blossoms. He said:" Mary, I consider it the most detested weed with which I am obliged to contend on the farm."</p><pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=130"/><p>After quite a long, tiresome walk in the hot sun, they discovered the lonely grave, covered with a slab of granite surrounded by a small iron railing and read the almost illegible date-"Seventeen Hundred and Forty" Ralph said,"If he ever sighed for a home in some vast wilderness, his wish is granted." It certainly was a lonely grave in the deep woods, and gave all the members of the party a sad and eerie feeling as they wended their way out into the sunlight again, to the waiting carriages, and

The Narrows are said to resemble somewhat the Palisades on the Hudson. I have seen the latter and think these greatly resemble them and are quite as interesting and picturesque."</p><p>"The name Narrows is derived from the fact that at this place the Delaware River has forced itself through the rocky barrier," continued the Professor, "hedged in on one side by cliffs of perpendicular rock, three hundred feet high, extending some distance along the river, leaving scarcely room at some places for the river and the canal. Some quite rare plants frow here, said to be found in few other localities in teh United Sates. You see hte highest flat rock along the Narrows? It is called 'Top Rock' and rises to a height of more than three hundred feet. We shall drive around within a short distance of it; then, after passing a small house, we are obliged to walk across a field of ploughed ground; follow the well-beaten path between trees and undergrowth, and 'Top Rock' is before us. Stepping upon the high ledge of rock projecting out over the road beneath, we discover it may also be reached by following a precipitous path and clinging to bushes and trees, but none of the party venture. Recently the body of a man who had been searching for rare birds' eggs on the side of this self-same rock was found dead on the path below the rocks. What caused his fall is not known. No wonder Aunt Sarah says it makes her dizzy when you boys skip stones across the river while standing on the rock."</p><p>The beautiful view of the Delaware River and the scenery on the opposite side was something long to be remembered. While the party were going into raptures over the beautiful sight, Professor Schmidt turned to Mary and remarked:"In those rocks which rise in perpendicular bluffs, several hundred feet above the level of the river, are evidence that prehistoric man may have inhabited the caves in these same walls of rock along the Delaware. From implements and weapons found, it does not require any great effort of imagination to believe the 'Cave Man' dwelt here many centuries ago."</p><p>Fritz Schmidt was much interested in his father's conversation,<pb n="102" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=132"/> and from that time on called Ralph Jackson Mary's "Cave Man."</p><p>Leaving Top Rock, the party wended their way back to the waiting carriages in the road, and drove to the "Ringing or Musical Rocks." They had been informed that their nearest approach to the rocks was to drive into the woods to reach them. Passing a small shanty at the roadside, where a sign informed the passerby that soft drinks were to be obtained, the party dismounted and found, to their surprise, a small pavilion had been erected with bench, table and numerous seats composed of boards laid across logs, where camp meetings had formerly been held. As the large trees furnished shade, and a spring of fresh water was near by, they decided to "strike" camp and have lunch before going farther into the woods.</p><p>Aunt Sarah and the Professor's wife spread a snowy cloth over the rough wooden table, quickly unpacked the hampers, and both were soon busily engaged preparing sandwiches of bread, thinly sliced, pink cold ham and ground peanuts, fried chicken and beef omelette' opeing jars of home-made pickles, raspberry jam and orange marmalade.</p><p>"Oh!" said Said Pauline," I'm so hungry for a piece of chocolate cake. Let me help shell the eggs, so we can soon have dinner."</p><p>Here's your fresh spring water," called Fritz, as he joined the party, atin pail in his hand. "We had such an early breakfast, I'm as hungry as a bear."</p><p>The party certainly did full justice to the good things provided with a lavish hand by Frau Schmidt and Aunt Sarah. All were in high spirits. The Professor quoted from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam--</p><p align="center">Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough,<lb/>A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou,<lb/>Beside me singing in the wilderness,<lb/>And wilderness is Paradise enow.</p><p>Ralph cast a look ar Mary, unnoticed by any one else, as much as to say,"The old tentmaker voiced my sentiments."</p><p>After the hampers had been repacked and stowed away in the carriages, they with the horses were left in the shade while the party walked to "High Falls," at no great distance from the<pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=133"/><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=134"/>

"High Falls," a beautiful waterfall about thirty feet high and fifty feet wide, is situated several hundred feet east of the Ringing Rocks. The water, before dashing below, passes over a large, solid, level floor of rock. After gazing at the Falls and picturesque surroundings, they searched through the woods for the Ringing Rocks, a preculiar formation of rocks of irregular shape and size, branching out from a common centre

</illustration><pb n="104" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=136"/> in four directions. The rocks vary in size from a few pounds to several tons in weight. Arriving there, Aunt Sarah said:"Ralph, you will now find use for the hammer which I asked you to bring." Ralph struck different rocks with the hammer, and Fritz Schmidt struck rocks with other pieces of rock, and all gave a peculiar metallic sound, the tones of each being different. The rocks are piled upon each other to an unknown depth, not a particle of earth being found between them, and not a bush or spear of grass to be seen. They occupy a space of about four and a half acres and are a natural curiosity well worth seeing. The young folks scrambled over the rocks for a time, and, having made them ring to their hearts' content, were satisfied to return to camp and supper.</p>

</illustration><p>"Not far distant from High Falls," said John Landis, when all were comfortably seated near the table, with a sandwich in hand,"is a place called Roaring Rocks, also a freak of nature. I remember, when a boy, I always went there in the fall of the year, after the first hard frost, to pick persimmons. The water could be distinctly heard running underneath the rocks at a considerable depth."</p><p>Ralph Jackson remarked to Aunt Sarah:"I never imagined<pb n="105" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=137"/> there were so many interesting, natural features right here in Bucks County."</p><p>Oh, yes," exclaimed the irrepressible Fritz Schmidt, "we have a few things besides pigs and potatoes."</p><p>"Yes, Ralph," said the Professor, "there are still several places of interest you will like to see. "Stony Garden' is another very interesting freak of nature. It is about two and a half miles from the small town of 'Snitzbachsville,' as Fritz calls the hamlet, and 'tis a wild spot. About an acre is covered with trap rock. The stones are of odd shapes and size and appear as if thrown into the forest in teh wildest confusion. No earth or vegetation is found about them. 'Tis said the rocks are similiar to those found at Fingal's Cave, Ireland, and also at the Palisades on the Hudson, and are not found anywhere else in this section of the country."</p><p>"And Ralph," said Fritz," I want to show you 'Big Rock,' at Avondale. where a party of us boys camped one summer for two weeks. Oh! but I remember the good pies given us by a farmer's wife who sold us milk and eggs, and who lived just across the fields from our camp."</p><p>"I think," said John Landis,"it is time we began hitching up our horses and starting for home. We have a long drive before us, and, therefore, must make an early start. Sarah, get the rest of the party together and pack up your traps."</p><p>At that moment the professor came in sight with an armful of ferns, the rich loam adhering to their roots, and said:"I'm sure these will grow." LAter he planted them on a shady side of the old farm house at "Five Oaks," where they are growing today. Professor Schmidt, after a diligent search, had found clinging to a rock a fine specimen of "Seedum Rhodiola," which he explained had never been found growing in any locality in the United States except Maine. Little Pauline, with a handful of flowers and weeds, came trotting after Mary, who carried an armful of creeping evergreen called partridge berry, which bears numerous small, bright, scarlet berries later in the season. Ralph walked by her side with a basket filled to overflowing with quantities of small ferns and rock moss, with which to border the edge of waiter on which Mary intended planting ferns; tree moss ot lichens, hepaticas, wild violets, pipsissewa or false winter-green, with dark green, waxy leaves weined with a lighter shade of<pb n="106" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=138"/> green; and wild pink geraniums, the folige of which is prettier than the pink bossoms seen later, and they grow readily when transplanted.</p><p>Aunt Sarah had taught Mary how to make a beautiful little home-made fernery. By planting these all on a large waiter, banking moss around the edges to keep them moist and by planting them early, they would be growing finely when taken by her to the city in the fall of the year-a pleasant reminder of her trip to the "Narrows" of the Delaware River. Frau Schmidt brought up the rear, carrying huge bunches of mint, pennyroyal and the useful herb called "Quaker Bonnet."</p>

To enliven the drowsy members of the parly. Fritz Schmidt sang the following to the tune of "My Old Kentucky Home," improvising as he sang:</p><p align="indent1">The moon shines bright on our "old Bucks County home,"<lb/>The meadows with daisies are gay,<lb/>The song of the whipporwill is borne on the breeze,<lb/>With the scent of the new mown hay.<lb/>Oh! the Narrows are great with their high granite peaks, And Ringing Rocks for ages the same;<pb n="107" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=139"/> But when daylight fades and we're tired and cold, There's no place like "hame, dear alt hame."</p><p>The last lingering rays of the sun idealized the surrounding fields and woods with that wonderful, afterglow seen only at the close of day. The saffron moon appeared to rise slowly from behind the distant tree-tops, and rolled on parallel with them, and then ahead, as if to guide them on their way, and the stars twinkled one by one from out the mantle of darkness which slowly enveloped the earth. The trees they swiftly passed, when the moonbeams tounches them, assumed gigantic, grotesque shapes in the darkness. Mary quoted from a favorite poem, "The Huskers," by Whittier:</p><p align="center">'Till broad and red as when he rose, the sun<lb/>Sank down at last,<lb/>And, like a merry guest's farewell, the day<lb/>In brightness passed.</p><p align="center">And lo! as through the western pines,<lb/>On meadow, stream and pond,<lb/>Flamed the red radiance of a sky,<lb/>Set all afire beyond.</p><p align="center">Slowly o'er the eastern sea bluffs,<lb/>Amilder glory shone,<lb/>And the sunset and the moon-rise<lb/>Were mingled into one!</p><p align="center">As thus into the quiet night,<lb/>The twilight lapsed away,<lb/>And deeper in the brightening moon<lb/>The tranquil shadows lay.</p><p align="center">From many a brown, old farm house<lb/>And hamlet without name,<lb/>Their milking and their home tasks done,<lb/>The merry huskers came.</p><p>"You mean 'The Merry Picknickers Came,'" said Fritz Schmidt. as Mary finished," and here we are at home.

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XIX.</hd><hd align="center">MARY IS TAUGHT TO MAKE PASTRY, PATTIES AND "ROSEN KUCHEN."</hd><p>Mary's Aunt taught her to make light, flaky pastry and pies of every description. In this part of Bucks County a young girl's education was considered incomplete without a knowledge of pie-making. Some of the commonest varieties of pies made at the farm were "Rivel Kuchen," a pie crust covered with a mixture of sugar, butter and flour crumbled together; "Snitz Pie," com-posed of either stewed dried apples or peaches, finely mashed through a colander, sweetened, spread over a crust and this covered with a lattice-work of narrow strips of pastry laid diamond-wise over the top of the pie; "Crumb" pies, very popular when served for breakfast, made with the addition of molasses or without it; Cheese pies, made of "Smier Kase;" Egg Custard, Pumpkin and Molasses pie.</p><p>Pies were made of all the different fruits and berries which grew on the farm. When fresh fruits were not obtainable, dried fruits and berries were used. Pie made from dried, sour cherries was an especial favorite of Farmer Landis, and raisin or "Rosina" pie. as it was usually called at the farm, also known as "Funeral" pie was a standby at all seasons of the year, as it was invariably served at funerals, where, in old times, sumptuous feasts were provided for relatives and friends, a regular custom for years among the "Pennsylvania Germans " and I have heard Aunt Sarah say, "In old times, the wives of the grave-diggers were always expected to assist with the extra baking at the house where a funeral was to be held."</p><p>It would seem as if Bucks County German housewives did not like a dessert without a crust surrounding it. </p><p>The Pennsylvania German farmers' wives, with few exceptions, serve the greatest variety of pies at a meal of any class of people I know; not alone as a dessert at twelve o'clock dinner, but frequently serve several different varieties of pie at breakfast and at each meal during the day. No ill effects following the<pb n="109" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=141"/> frequent eating of pie I attribute to their active life, the greater part of which, during the day, was usually spent in the open air, and some credit may be due the housewife for having acquired the knack of making 
<emph rend="italic">good</emph> pie crust, which was neither very rich nor indigestible, if such a thing be possible.</p><p>The combination of fruit and pastry called pie is thought to be of American invention. Material for pies at a trifling cost were furnished the early settlers in Bucks County by the large supply of fruit and vegetables which their fertile farms produced, and these were utilized by the thrifty German housewives, noted for their wise management and economy.</p><p>The Professor's wife taught Mary to make superior pastry, so flaky and tender as to fairly melt in one's mouth; but Mary never could learn from her the knack of making a dainty, crimped edge to her pies with thumb and forefinger, although it looked so very simple when she watched "Frau Schmidt" deftly roll over a tiny edge as a finish to the pie.</p><p>Mary laughingly told the Professor's wife (when speaking of pies) of the brilliant remark she marie about lard, on first coming to the farm. Her Aunt Sarah, when baking pies one day, said to her, "Look, Mary, see this can of snowy lard, rendered from pork, obtained from out fat pigs last winter!"</p><p>"Why, Aunt Sarah!" exclaimed Mary, "is lard made from pork fat? I always thought lard was made from milk and butter was made from cream."</p><p>The Professor's wife possessed, besides a liking for pies, the German's fondness for anything pertaining to fritters. She used a set of "wafer and cup irons" for making "Rosen Kuchen," as she called the flat, saucer-like wafer; and the cup used for serving creamed vegetables, salads, etc., was similiar to pattie cases.</p><p>"The 'Wafer and Cup Irons,'" said Frau Schmidt, "were invented by a friend of mine, also a teacher and an excellent cook, besides; she gave me several of her original recipies, all to be served on wafers or in patties. You shall have a set of the irons when you start housekeeping. Mary. You will be sur-prised at the many uses you will find for them. They are somewhat similiar to Rosette Irons, but I think them an improvement. They are pieces of fluted steel fastened to a long handle and one is cup-shaped. This latter is particularly fine for making<pb n="110" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=142"/> patties. Then the cup may be filled and served on saucer-like wafers, which I call "Rosen Kuchen," or the "Rosen Kuchen" may be simply dusted with a mixture consisting of one cup of sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoonful of powdered cardamon seed, and served on a plate, as dainty cakes or wafers."</p><p>Aunt Sarah, when cooking fritters, always used two-thirds lard and one-third suet for deep frying, but "Frau Schmidt" thought food fried in oil more digestible and wholesome than when fried in lard. The patties or wafers were easily made. "Frau Schmidt" placed the long-handled iron in hot fat, the right temperature for frying fritters. When the iron was heated she quickly and carefully wiped off any surplus fat, then at once dipped the hot wafer iron into a bowl containing the batter she had prepared (the recipe for which she gave Mary), then dipped the iron into the hot fat; when the batter had lightly browned she gently dropped it from the iron onto brown paper, to absorb any fat which might remain. These are quickly and easily pre-pared and, after a few trials, one acquires proficiency. Pattie cases or cup-shapes are made in a similar manner. They are not expensive and may be kept several weeks in a cool, dry place. When wanted for table use, place in a hot oven a few minutes to reheat. They make a dainty addition to a luncheon by simply dusting the "Rosen Kuchen" with pulverized sugar. Creamed vegetables of any variety may be served on them by placing a spoon of cream dressing on top of each, over which grate yolk of hard boiled egg; or use as a foundation on which to serve salads; or serve fruit on them with whipped cream. The patties or cups may be used to serve creamed chicken, oysters, or sweetbreads if no sugar be used in the batter. These pattie cases are exactly like those sold at delicatessen counters, in city stores, and are considered quite an addition to a dainty luncheon. They are rather expensive to buy, and we country housewives cannot always procure them when wanted, and they may be made at home with a small amount of labor and less expense.</p><p>"The Germans make fritters of almost everything imagina-ble," continued the Professor's wife. "One day in early Spring I saw a German neighbor gathering elderberry blossoms, of which she said she intended making fritters. I asked her how they were<pb n="111" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=143"/> made, being curious, I will confess. She sent me a plate of the fritters and they were delicious. I will give you her recipe should you care for it. Mary, have you ever eaten a small, sweet wafer called 'Zimmet Waffle?' My mother made them at Christmas time, in Germany. Should I be able to procure a small 'waffle,' or should I call it wafer, iron, in the city, I will teach you how they are made. I think them excellent. My mother made a cake with vanilla. A piece of dough the size of a small marble was placed in the wafer iron, which was then pressed together and held over the fire in the range, by a long handle, until the wafer was crisp and brown. They are delicious and will keep indefinitely."</p><p>The Professor's wife finished speaking to Mary, and turned to her daughter Elizabeth, saying. "It is time I mix the dough if we are to have 'Boova Shenkel' for dinner today. I see the potatoes have steamed tender."</p><p>"Oh, goody!" said Pauline, "I just love 'Boova Shenkel!'"</p><p>"Then," said her Mother, "run down into the cellar and get me three eggs for them, and Mary, I'll write off the recipe for you, if you wish it, as I feel sure you'll like them as well as Pauline. And Elizabeth, dust powdered sugar over this plate of 'Rosen Kuchen,' and you, Mary and Pauline, leave this hot kitchen and have lunch out in the 'Espalier,' as your Father calls it."</p><p>"I think," said Mary to Elizabeth, after they were seated in the shade, prepared to enjoy the "Rosen Kuchen," "this little, natural, home-grown summer-house is the oddest and prettiest little place I've ever seen."</p><p>"Yes." assented Elizabeth, "Father said he made it as nearly like as possible to a Urge one at Weisbaden, no great distance from his old home in Germany. He says the 'Frauer Esche,' meaning Weeping Ash, at Weisbaden, had tables and benches placed beneath spreading branches of the tree, and picnics were frequently held there. This one was made by the larger branches of the Weeping Ash, turing downward, fastened by pieces of leather to a framework nailed to the top of posts in the ground, about two yards apart, surrounding the tree. The posts, you notice, are just a little higher than an ordinary man, and when the leaves thickly cover the lops and sides, protecting one from<pb n="112" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=144"/> the sun rays, it is an ideal Summer-house. We frequently sit here evenings and afternoons: Mother brings her sewing am! Pauline her doll family, which you know is quite numerous."</p><p>The Professor's wife not only taught Mary the making of superior pastry and the cooking of German dishes, but, what was of still greater importance, taught her the value of different foods; that cereals of every description, flour and potatoes, are starchy foods; that cream, butter, oil. etc., are fat foods; that all fruits and vegetables contain mineral matter; and that lean meat, eggs, beans, peas and milk are muscle-forming foods. These are things every young housekeeper should have a knowledge of to be able to plan nourishing, wholesome, well-balanced meals for her family. And not to serve at one time a dish or rice, cheese and macaroni, baked beans and potatoes. Serve instead with one of these dishes fruit, a vegetable or salad. She said "beans have largely percentage of nutriment and should be more commonly used." She also said graham and corn bread are much more nutritious than bread made from fine white flour, which lacks the nutritious elements. Indian corn is said to contain the largest amount of fat of any cereal. It is one of our most important cereal foods and should be more commonly used by house-wives; especially should it be used by working men whose occupation requires a great amount of physical exercise. Partially in cold weather should it be frequently served, being both cheap and wholesome.</p><p>The Professor's wife laughingly remarked to Mary, "When I fry fritters or 'Fast Nacht' cakes, Fritz and Pauline usually assist such a large number of them in disappearing before I have finished baking, I am reminded of 'Doughnutting Time,' by J. W. Foley. Have you never read the poem?

She said, "Mary, this recipe was almost invaluable to me when I was a young housekeeper and the stricktest economy was necessary. Sift into a bowl, one cup of flour, one even teaspoonful of baking powder (I use other baking powders occasionally, but prefer 'Royal'), then cut through the flour either one tablespoonful of butter or lard, add a pinch of salt, and mix into a soft dough with about one-half cup of sweet milk. Mix dough<pb n="114" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=146"/> quickly and lightly, handling as little as possible. Drop large spoonfuls of the batter in muffin pans and bake in a quick oven for tea biscuits; or, sift flour thickly over the bread board, turn out the dough, roll several times in the flour, give one quick turn with the rolling-pin to flatten out dough, and cut out with small cake cutter. (I prefer using a small, empty tin, 1/2-pound baking powder can, to cut out cakes.) Place close together in an agate pan and bake, or bake in one cake in a pie tin and for short-caked; or place spoonfuls of the dough over veal or beef stew and potatoes or stewed chicken, and cook, closely covered, about fifteen minutes. Of course, you will have sufficient water in the stew pan to prevent its boiling away before the pot-pie dumplings are cooked, and, of course, you know, Mary, the meat and potatoes must be almost ready to serve when this dough is added. Then I frequently add one teaspoonful of sugar to the batter and place spoonfuls over either freshly stewed or canned sour cherries, plums, rhubarb or apples. In fact, any tart fruit may be used, and steam, closely covered, or place large tablespoonful of any fruit, either canned or stewed, in small custard cups, place tablespoonfuls of batter on top and steam or bake, and serve with either some of the stewed fruit and fruit juice, sugar and cream, or any sauce preferred."</p><p>"The varieties of puddings which may be evolved from this one formula," continued the Professor's wife, "are endless, and, Mary. I should advise you to make a note of it. This quantity of flour will make enough to serve two at a meal, and the proportions may be easily doubled if you wish to serve a large family."</p><p>"Then, Mary, I have a recipe taken from the 'Farmers' Bulletin' for dumplings, which {book error in spacing} Ithink fine. You must try it some time. Your Aunt Sarah thinks them 'dreadfully extravagant.' They call for four teaspoonfuls of baking powder to two cups of flour, but they are perfect puff balls, and this is such a fast age, why not use more baking powder if an advantage? I am always ready to try anything new I hear about."</p><p>"Yes," replied Mary, "I just love to try new recipes. I will experiment with the dumplings one of these days. Aunt Sarah syas I will never use half the recipes I have; but so many of them have been give me by excellent and reliable old Buck County cooks, I intend to copy them all in a book, and keep for reference after I leave the farm.</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XX.</hd><hd align="center">OLD POTTERIES AND DECORATED DISHES.</hd><p>One day, looking through the old corner cupboard, Mary exclaimed. "Aunt Sarah, you certainly possess the finest collection of quaint old china dishes I have ever seen. I just love those small saucers and cups without handles; yes, and you have plates to match decorated with pinkish, lavender peacock feathers, and those dear little cups and saucers, decorated inside with pink and outside with green flowers, are certainly odd; and this queerly- shaped cream jug, sugar bowl and teapot, with pale green figures, and those homely plates, with dabs of bright red and green, they surley must be very old!"</p>
<illustration><caption>Old Earthenware Dish</caption><description>A picture of a dish that is decorated with flower designs.</description>
</illustration><p>"Yes, dear, they all belonged to either John's mother or mine. All except this one large, blue plate, which is greatly valued by me, as it was given me many years ago by a dear old friend, Mary Butler, a descendant of one of the oldest families in Wyoming Valley, whose forefathers date back to the time of the 'Wyoming Massacre,' about which so much has been written in song and story."</p><p>"The very oddest plates in your collection are those earthenware dishes, especially that large circular dish, with sloping sides and flat base, decorated with tulips."</p><p>"Yes. Mary, and it is the one I value most highly. It is called sgraffito ware. A tulip decoration surrounds a large red star in<pb n="116" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=148"/> the centre of the plate. This belonged to my mother, who said it came from the Headman pottery at Rockhill Township, about the year 1808. I know of only other two others in existence at the present time; one is in a museum in the city of Philadelphia and the other one is in the Bucks County Historical Society at Doylestown, Pa. The other earthenware plate you admire, containing marginal inscription in German which when translated is 'This plate is made of earth, when it breaks the potter laughs,' is the very oldest in my collection, the date on it, you see, is 1786. Those curved, shallow earthenware pie plates, or 'Poi Schissel,' as they are frequently called in this part of Bucks County, I value, even if they

</illustration> are quite plain and without decoration, as they were always used by my when baking pies, and I never thought pies baked in any other shaped dish tasted equally as good as hers. These pie plates were manufactured at one of the old potteries near her home. All the old potters have passed away, and the buildings have crumbled to the ground. Years ago, your mother and I, when visiting the old farm where the earlier years of our childhood were passed, stopped with one of our old-time friends, who lived<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=149"/>

The sight was a sad one. We realized the hand of time had crumbled to dust both the potter and his clay. Still nearer my old home was the McEntee pottery. From earliest childhood our families were friends. We all attended the 'Crossroads' School, where years later a more modern brick structue was built, under the hill; not far distant from 'The Narrows' and the 'Ringing Rocks.' Yes, Mary, my memory goes back to the time when the McEntee pottery was a flourishing industry, operated by three brothers, John, Patrick and Michael. When last I visited them but few landmarks remained."</p><p>"Was there a pottery on your father's farm, Aunt Sarah?" inquired Mary.</p><p>"No. The nearest one was the McEntee pottery, but the grandson of the old man who purchased our old farm at my father's death had a limekiln for the purpose of burning lime, and several miles distant, at the home of my uncle, was found clay suitable for the manufacture of bricks. Only a few years ago this plant was still in operation. My father's farm was situated in the upper part of Bucks County, in what was then known as the Nockamixon Swamp, and at one time there were in that neighborhood no less than seven potteries within two miles of each other."</p><p>"Why," exclaimed Mary, "were there so many potteries in that locality?"</p><p>" 'Twas due, no doubt, to the large deposits of clay found there, well suited to the manufacture of earthenware. The soil is a clayey loam, underlaid with potter's clay. The old German potters, on coming to this country, settled mostly in Easter Pennsylvania, in the countries of Bucks and Montgomery. The numerous small potteries erected by the early settlers were for the manufacture of earthernware dishes, also pots of graded sizes. These were called nests, and were used principally on the farm for holding milk, cream and applebutter. Jugs and pie plates were also manufactured. The plates were usually quite plain, but they reduced<pb n="118" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=152"/> occasionally plates decorated with conventionalized tulips, and some, more elaborate, contained besides figures of animals, birds and flowers. Marginal inscriptions in English and German decorate many of the old plates, from which may be learned many interesting facts concerning the life and habits of the early settlers. I think, judging from the inscriptions I have seen on some old plates. it must have taxed the ingenuity of the old German potters to think up odd, original inscriptions for their plates."</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, how was sgraffito ware made? Is it the same as slip-decorated pottery ?"</p><p>"No, my dear, the two are quite different. The large plate you so greatly admired is called sgraffito or scratched work, sometimes called slip engraving. It usually consists of dark designs on a cream-colored ground. After the plates had been shaped over the mold by the potter, the upper surface was covered by a coating of white slip, and designs were cut through this slip to show the earthenware underneath. This decoration was more commonly used by the old potters than slip decorating, which consisted in mixing white clay and water until the consistency of cream. The liquid clay was then allowed to run slowly through a quill attached to a small cup, over the earthenware (before burning it in a kiln) to produce different designs. The process is similar to that used when icing a cake, when you allow the icing to run slowly from a pastry tube to form fanciful designs. I have watched the old potters at their work many a time when a child. The process employed in the manufacture of earthenware is almost the same today as it was a century ago, but the appliances of the present day workmen are not so primitive as were those of the old German potters. Mary, a new pottery works has been started quite lately in the exact locality where, over one hundred years ago, were situated the Diehl and Headman potteries, where my highly-prized, old sgraffito plate was manufactured. I hear the new pottery has improved machinery for the manufacture of vases, flower pots, tiles, etc. They intend manufacturing principally 'Spanish tiles' from the many acres of fine clay found at that place. The clay, it is said, burns a beautiful dark, creamy red. As you are so much interested in this subject, Mary, we shall visit this new pottery some day in the near future, in company with your Uncle John. It is no great distance from the farm. Quite an interesting story I have heard in connection with a pottery<pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=153"/><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=154"/>

I'd love to hear the story."</p><p>"This Quaker sympathized with the colored race, or negroes, in the South. This was, of course, before slavery was abolished. You don't remember that time, Mary. You are too young. It is only history to you, but I lived it, and when the slaves ran away from their owners and came North to Philadelphia they were sent from there, by sympathizers, to this Quaker, who kept an underground station. The slaves were then placed, under his direction, in a high 'pot wagon,' covered with layers or nests of earthenware pots of graded sizes. I heard the driver of one of these pot wagons remark one time that when going down a steep hill, he put on the brake and always held his breath until the bottom of the hill was reached, fearing the pots might all be broken. The wagon-load containting earthenware and slaves was driven to Stroudsburg, where the pots were delivered to a wholesale customer. Here the runaways were released from their cranmped quarters and turned over to sympathizing friends, who assisted them in reaching Canada and safety. I have frequently met the fine looking, courtly old gentleman who owned the pottery, and old Zacariah Mast, the skilled German potter whom he employed. They were for many years familiar figures in the little Quaker town, not many miles distant. Both passed away many years ago."</p><p>Mary, who still continued her explorations of the corner cupboard, exclaimed: "Oh! Aunt Sarah! Here is another odd, old plate, way back on the lop shelf, out of sight."</p><p>"Yes, dear, that belonged to your Uncle John's mother. It has never been used and was manufactured over one hundred years ago at an old pottery in Bedminister Township, Bucks County. Some of those other quaint, old-fashioned plates also belonged to John's mother. Your Uncle loves old dishes and especially old furniture; he as so anxious to possess his grandfather's old 'Solliday' clock. In the centre of the face of the clock a hand indicated the day of the month and pictures of two large, round moons on the upper part of the clock's face (resembing nothing so much as large, ripe peaches) represented the different phases of the moon. If new moon, or the first or last quarter,<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=156"/> it appeared, then disappeared from sight. It was valued highly, being the last clock made by the old clockmaker; but John never came into possession of it, as it was claimed by an elder sister. I value the old clock which stands in the parlor because 'twas my mother's, although it is very plain. This old cherry, corner cupboard was made for my grandmother by her father, a cabinetmaker, as a wedding gift, and was given me by my mother. Did you notice the strong, substantial manner in which it is made? It resembles mission furniture."</p><p>"Do tell me, Aunt, what this small iron boat, on the top shelf, was ever used for? It must be of value, else 'twould not occupy a place in the cupboard with all your pretty dishes."</p><p>"Yes, dearie, 'twas my grandmother's lamp, called in old times a 'Schmutz Amschel' which, translated, means a grease robin, or bird. I have two of them. I remember seeing my grandmother many a time, when the 'Amschel' was partly filled with melted lard or liquid fat, light a piece of lampwick hanging over the little pointed end or snout of the lamp. The lamp was usually suspended from a chain fastened to either side. A spike on the chain was stick into the wall, which was composed of logs. This light, by the way, was not particularly brilliant, even when one sat close beside it, and could not be compared with the gas and electric lights of our present day and generation. That was a very primitive manner of illumination used by our forefathers.</p><p>"Mary, did you notice the gayly-decorated, old-fashioned coffee pot and tea caddy in the corner cupboard? They belonged to my grandmother; also that old-fashioned fluid lamp, used before coal-oil or kerosene came into use; and that old, perforated tin lantern also is very ancient.</p><p>"Mary, have you ever read the poem, 'The Potter and the Clay?' No? Then read it to me, dear, I like it well; 'tis a particular favorite of mine. I do not remember by whom it was written."</p><hd align="center">THE POTTER AND THE CLAY.</hd>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXI.</hd><hd align="center">THE VALUE OF WHOLESOME, NUTRITIOUS FOOD.</hd><p>"Yes, my dear," said Frau Schmidt (continuing a conversation which bad occurred several days previously between herself and Mary), "we will have more healthful living when the young housewife of the present day possesses a knowledge of different food values (those food products from which a well-balanced meal may be prepared) for the different members of her household. She should endeavor to buy foods which are most nourishing and wholesome; these need not necessarily consist of more expensive food products. Cheaper food, if property cooked, may have as fine a flavor and be equally as nutritious as that of higher price.</p><p>"And, Mary, when you marry and have a house to manage, if possible, do your own marketing, and do not make the mistake common to so many young, inexperienced housewives, of buying more expensive food than your income will allow. Some think economy in purchasing food detrimental to their dignity and to the well-being of their families; ofte nthe ones most extravagant in this respect are those least able to afford it. Frequently the cause of this is a lack of knowledge of the value of different foods. The housewife with a large family and limited means should purchase cheaper cuts of meat, which become tender and palatable by long simmering. Combine them with the different vegetables, cooked in the broth, and serve as the principal dish at a meal, or occasionally serve dumplings composed of a mixture of flour and milk, cooked in the broth, to extend the meat flavor. Frequently serve a dish of rice, hominy, cornmeal and oatmeal, dried heans and peas. These are all nutritious, nourishing foods whem properly cooked and attractively served. And remember, Mary, to always serve food well seasoned. Mary a well-cooked meal owes its failure to please to a lack of proper seasoning. This is a lesson a young cook must learn. Neither go to the other extreme and salt food too liberally. Speaking of salt, my dear, have you read the poem, 'The King's Daughters,' by Margaret Vandegrift? If not, read it, and then copy it in your book of recipes."</p><pb n="123" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=159"/><hd align="center">"THE KING'S DAUGHTERS."</hd><p>The King's three little daughters, 'nearth the palace window straying.</p><p>Had fallen into earnest talk that put an end to playing;<lb/>And the weary King smiled once again to hear what they were saying;<lb/>"It is I who love our father best," the eldest daughter said;<lb/>"I am the oldest princess," and her pretty face grew red;<lb/>"What is there none can do without?

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXII.</hd><hd align="center">A VARIETY OF CAKES EVOLVED FROM ONE RECIPE.</hd><p>"Aunt Sarah," questioned Mary one day, "will you tell me how it is possible to evolve a number of cakes from one recipe?"</p><p>"Certainly I will, my dear," said her Aunt. "For instance, take the simple recipe from which I have for years baked layer cake. You may have other recipes given you, equally as good, but I feel positive none better. The cake made from this recipe is not rich enough to be unwholesome, but a good, reliable, inexpensive, easily-made cake, with which I have never had a failure.</p><p>"The recipe, as you know, consists of 1 1/4 cups of granulated sugar, 1/2 cup of a mixture of butter and sweet lard (or use all butter), 1.2 cup sweet milk, 2 cups flour and 2 teaspoonfuls baking powder. 3 eggs</p><p>The simplest manner of baking this cake is in two square cake pans. When baked, take from pans and ice each cake with a boiled chocolate icing and put together as a layer cake, or ice each cake with a plain, boiled white icing and, when this is cold, you may spread over top of each cake unsweetened chocolate, which has been melted over steam after being grated. When cake is to be served, cut in diamonds or squares. Or add to the batter 1 cup of chopped hickory nut meats, bake in 2 layers and cut in squares.</p><p>"For a chocolate loaf cake, add two generous tablespoonfuls of unsweetened melted chocolate to the batter just before baking. If you wish a chocolate layer cake, use the same batter as for the chocolate loaf cake, bake in two layer pans and put together with white boiled icing.</p><p>"Or, add to this same batter one scant teaspoonful of cinnamon, ginger, 1/2 teaspoonful of grated nutmeg and cloves, a cup of raisins or dried currants, and you have a small fruit cake.</p><p>"Or, add a small quantity of thinly-shaved citron to the original recipe, flavor with lemon, bake in a loaf and spread a white<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=162"/> icing flavored with lemon extract over top of cake, and you have a lemon cake.</p><p>"Or, add chocolate and spices to one-half the batter (about one-half as much chocolate and spices as were used in batter for fruit cake) and place spoonfuls of the light and dark batter alternately in a cake pan, until all batter has been used, and you will have a cheap, old-fashioned Marble cake.</p><p>"Or, bake cake over original recipe, in two-layer pans, placing between layers either tart jelly, a creamy cornstarch filling, grated cocoanut, apple cream filling, or you might even use half the recipe given for the delicious icing or filling for Lady Baltimore cake.</p><p>"Lastly, bake small cakes from this same recipe. Mary, you should have small pans for baking these delicious little cakes, similar to those I possess, which I ordered made at the tinsmith's. I took for a pattern one Frau Schmidt loaned me. They are the exact size of one-quarter pound boxes of Royal baking powder. Cut the box in three pieces of equal height, and your cakes will be equally as large in diameter as the baking powder box, but only one-third as high. I think I improved on Frau Schmidt's cake tins, as hers were all separate. I ordered twelve tins, similar to hers, to be fastened to a piece of sheet iron. I had two of these iron sheets made, containing twenty-four little pans. I place a generous tablespoonful of the batter in each of the twenty-four small pans, and cakes rise to the top of pans. Usually I have batter remaining after these are filled. Ice all the cake except the top with a white boiled icing or chocolate icing. These small cakes keep exceedingly well, and are always liked by young folks and are particularly nice for children's parties."</p><p>"Speaking of cakes, Aunt Sarah," said Mary, "have you ever used Swansdown cake flour? I have a friend in the city who uses it for making the most delicious Angel cake and she gave me a piece of Gold cake made over a recipe in 'Cake Secrets,' which comes with the flour, and it was fine. I'll get a package of the flour for you the first time I go to the city. The flour resembles a mixture of ordinary flour and cornstarch. It is not a prepared flour, to be used without baking powder, and you use it principally for baking cakes. I have the recipe for both the Gold and Angel cakes, with the instructions for baking same. They are as follows:</p><pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=163"/><hd align="center">ANGEL CAKE.</hd><p>"For the Angel cake, use one even cupful of the whites of egg (whites of either eight large or nine small eggs); a pinch of salt, if added when beating eggs, hastens the work. One and one-quarter cups granulated sugar, 1 cup of Igelhart's Swansdown cake flour. Sift flour once, then measure and sift three times. Beat whites of eggs about half, add 1/2 teaspoonful of cream of tartar, then bear whites of eggs until they will stand of their own weight. Add sugar, then flour, not by stirring, but by folding over and over, until thoroughly mixed. Flavor with 1/2 teaspoonful of vanilla or a few drops of almond extract. As much care should be taken in 
<emph rend="italic">baking</emph> an Angel Food cake as in mixing. Bake in an ungreased patent pan. Place the cake in an oven that is just warm enough to know there is a fire inside the range. Let the oven stay just warm through until the batter has raised to the top of the cake pan, then increase the heat gradually until the cake is well browned over. If by pressing the top of the cake with the finger it will spring back without leaving the impression of the finger, the cake is done through. Great care should be taken that the oven is not too hot to begin with, as the cake will rise too fast and settle or fall in the baking. It should bake in from 35 to 40 minutes' time. When done, invert the pan and let stand until cold before removing it. Should you see cake browning before it rises to top of pan, throw your oven door open and let cold air rush in and cool your oven instantly. Be not afraid. The cold air will not hurt the cake. Two minutes will cool any oven. Watch cake closely. Don't be afraid to open oven door every three or four minutes. This is the only way to properly bake this cake. When cake has raised above top of pan, increase your heat and finish baking rapidly. Baking too lond dries out the moisture, makes it tough and dry. When cake is done it begins to shrink. Let it shrink back to level of pan. Watch carefully at this stage and take out of oven and invert immediately. Rest on centre tube of pan. Let hang until perfectly cold, then take cake carefully from pan. When baking Angel cake always be sure the oven bakes good brown under bottom of cake. If cake does not crust under bottom it will fall out when inverted and shrink in the fall."</p><p>"I never invert my pans of Angel cake on taking them from oven," said Mary's Aunt, "as the cakes are liable to fall out even if<pb n="128" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=164"/> the pan is not greased. I think it safer to allow the pans containing the cakes to stand on a rack and cool without inverting the pan. </p><p>"Suppose, Mary, we bake a Gold cake over the recipe from 'Cake Secrets,' as eggs are plentiful; but we haven't any Swans-down flour. I think we will wait until we get it from the city."</p><hd align="center">GOLD CAKE.</hd><p>Yolks of 8 eggs; 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, 3/4 cup of butter, 3/4 cup water, 2 1/2 cups of Swansdown cake flour, 2 heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 1/2 teaspoonful lemon extract.

The Angel cake receipe is very similar to an original recipe Frau Schmidt gave me; she uses cornstarch instead of Swansdown flour and she measure the eggs in a cup instead of taking a certain number; she thinks it more exact.</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, did you know Frau Schmidt, instead of using flour alone when baking cakes, frequently uses a mixture of flour and cornstarch? She sifts together, several limes, six cups of flour and one cup of cornstarch, and uses this instead of using flour alone.</p><p>"I dearly love the Professor's wife--she's been so very good to me," exclaimed Mary.</p><p>"Yes." replied her Aunt, "she has very many lovable qualities."</p><p>Mary's liking for bright, energetic Frau Schmidt was not greater than the affection bestowed on Mary by the Professor's wife, who frequently entertained Mary with tales of her life when a girl in Germany, to all of which Mary never tired listening. One Aunt, a most estimable woman, held the position of valued and respected housekeeper and cook for the Lord Mayor of the city wherein she resided. Another relative, known as "Schone Anna," for many years kept an inn named "The Four Seasons," noted for<pb n="129" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=165"/> the excellent fare served by the fair chatelaine to her patrons. The iinn was made famous by members of the King's household stopping there while in the town during the Summer months, which was certainly a compliment to her good cooking. One of the things in which she particularly excelled was potato cakes raised with yeast. Frau Schmidt had been ggiven a number of these valuable recipes by her mother, all of which she offered to Mary. One recipe she particularly liked was "Fast Nacht Cakes," which the Professor's wife baked always without fail on Shrove Tuesday (or "Fast Nact" day), the day before the beginning of Lent. This rule was as "unchangeable as the law of Medes and Persians," and it would have been a very important event, indeed, which would have prevented the baking of these toothsome delicacies on that day.</p>

The old certificate was signed by a German Reformed minister named Wack, who history tells us was the first young man of that denomination to be<pb n="131" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=167"/> ordained to the ministry in America. Folded with this "Taufschien" is another which has never been filled out. This is printed in German. Pictures of women, perhaps they are intended to represent angles, with golden wings, clothed in loose-flowing crimson drapery and holding harps in their hands; birds with gayly-colored plumage of bluish green, crimson and yellow, perched on branches of what presumably represent cherry trees, also decorate the page. Religious hymns printed on the "Taufschiens," encircled with gay stripes of light blue and yellow, dotted with green, further embellish them. On one we read:</p><p align="center">"Infinite joy or endless woe,<lb/>Attend on every breath;<lb/>And yet, how unconcerned we go<lb/>Upon the brink of death."</p><p>Mary, this old 'Taufschien' of my grandmother's is one of my most cherished possessions. Would you like to see your Uncle's old deed, which he came into possession of when he inherited the farm from his father?"</p><p>Carefully unfolding the stiff old parchment or pigskin deed, yellowed and brown spotted with age, Mary could faintly decipher the writing wherein, beautifully written, old-fashioned penmanship of two hundred years ago stated that a certain piece of land in Bucks County, Beginning at a Chestnut Oak, North to a post; then East to a large rock, and on the South unsettled land, which in later years was conveyed to John Landis.</p><p>"This deed," said Mary's Aunt, "was given in 1738, nearly two hundred years ago, by John, Thomas and Richard Penn, sons of William Penn by his second marriage, which occurred in America. His eldest son, John Penn, you have no doubt heard, was called 'The American,' he having been born in this country before William Penn's return to Europe, where he remained fifteen years, as you've no doubt heard."</p><p>At the bottom of the deed a blue ribbon has been slipped through cuts in the parchment, forming a diamond which incloses what is supposed to be the signature of Thomas Penn.</p><p>"Aunt Sarah, I am not surprised that you value this old deed of the farm and these 'Taufschiens' of your grandmother.

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXIV.</hd><hd align="center">THE OLD STORE ON THE RIDGE ROAD.</hd><p>Aunt Sarah found in Mary a willing listener when talking of the time in years past when her grandfather kept a small "Country Store" on the Ridge Road in Bucks County. She also remembered, when a child of ten, accompanying her grandfather on one of his trips when he drove to Philadelphia to purchase goods for his store.</p><p>"They had no trolley cars in those days?" asked Mary.</p><p>"No, my dear, neither did they have steam cars between the different towns and cities as we have now."</p><p>"At grandfather's store could be bought both groceries and dry goods. The surrounding farmers' wives brought to the store weekly fresh print butter, eggs, pot cheese and hand-case, crocks of apple-butter, dried sweet corn, beans, cherries, peach and apple 'Snitz,' taking in exchange sugar, starch, coffee, molasses, etc. My father tapped his sugar maples and mother cooked down the syrup until thick, and we used that in place of molasses. They also took in exchange shaker flannel, nankeen, indigo blue and 'Simpson' gray calico, which mother considered superior to any other, both for its washing and wearing qualities. The farmers who came occasionally to the store to shop for different members of the family frequently bought whole pieces of calico of one pattern, and," affirmed Aunt Sarah. "I knew of one farmer who bought several whole pieces of one pattern with rather large figures on a dark wine ground, resembling somewhat the gay figures on an old paisley shawl. He said 'twas a good, serviceable color, and more economical to buy it all alike, and remarked: 'What's the difference, anyway? ' Calico is calico.' From the same piece of calico his wife made dresses, aprons and sunbonnets for herself and daughters, shirts for the farmer and his sons (the boys were young, fortunately), and patchwork quilts and comfortables from the remainder."</p><p>"Rather monotonous, I should think," said Mary. "I am surprised<pb n="133" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=169"/> his wife did not make him wear coat and trousers made from the same piece of calico."</p><p>"The dry goods," continued Aunt Sarah, "retained the scent of coffee, cheese and dried fruits some time after being purchased, but no one minded that in those days. I still remember how perfectly wonderful to me when a child appeared the large, wide-mouthed glass jars containing candy. There were red and white striped mint sticks, striped yellow and white lemon sticks and
<illustration><caption>THE OLD STORE ON RIDGE ROAD</caption><description>A picture of people in front of a store.</description>
</illustration> hoarhound and clear, wine-colored sticks striped with lines of white, flavored with anise-seed. One jar contained clear lemon-colored 'Sour Balls,' preferred by us children on account of their lasting qualities, as also were the jujubees, which resembled nothing so much as gutta percha, and possessed equally as fine flavor; also pink and yellow sugar-frosted gumdrops. In a case at one end of the counter were squares of thick white paper covered with rows of small pink, also white, 'peppermint buttons,' small sticks, two inches in length, of chewing gum in waxed paper, a white, tasteless, crystalline substance resembling paraffine. What longing eyes I frequently cast at the small scalloped cakes of maple<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=170"/> sugar, prohibitive as regards cost. They sold for a nickel, and I was always inordinately fond of maple sugar, but the price was prohibitive. I seldom possessed more than a penny to spend in those days, and not always that. Father raised a large family, money was never plentiful, and we relished the plain, cheap candies usually sold in those days more than many children of the present day do the finest and most expensive cream chocolates, to many of whom in this extravagant age a dollar is not valued more highly than was a penny by us in years gone by. And 'Candy Secrets!' I don't believe you know what they are like. I've not seen any for years. They were small, square pieces of taffy-like candy, wrapped in squares of gilt or silver paper, inclosing a small strip of paper containing a couple of sentimental lines or jingle. Later came 'French Secrets.' They consisted of a small oblong piece of candy about an inch in length, wrapped in tissue paper of different colors, having fringed ends, twisted together at either end. These also inclosed a tiny strip of paper containing a line or two. Small, white candy hearts contained the words in pink letters, 'Little Sweetheart,' 'I Love You,' 'Name the Day,' etc. These were invariably distributed among the young folds at small parties and created no end of merriment."</p><p>"Mary, old as I am, I still remember the delight I experienced when a little, rosy-cheeked urchin surreptitiusly passed me aroudn the corner of my desk at the old 'Cross Roads School' a 'Secret,' with the words, 'Do you love me?' My grandmother always kep a supply of hoarhound and peppermint lozenges in her knitting basket to give us children should we complain of hoarseness. My, but 'twas astonishing to hear us all cough until grandmother's supply of mints was exhausted. I think, Mary, I must have had a 'sweet tooth' when a child, as my recollectiosn seem to be principally about the candy kept in my grandfather's store. I suppose in those early days of my childhood candy appealed to me more than anything else, as never having had a surfeit of sweets, candy to me was a rare treat. I remember, Mary, when a little child, my thrifty mother, wishing to encourage me to learn to knit my own stockings, she, when winding the skein of German yarn into a ball, occasionally wound a penny in with the yarn. I was allowed to spend the penny only after I had knitted the yarn and the penny had fallen from the ball. What untold wealth that penny represented! And planning how to<pb n="135" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=171"/> spend it was grater pleasure still. Many a pair of long, old-fashioned, dark blue and red-striped stockings were finished more quickly than otherwise would have been done without the promised reward. I became proficient in knitting at an early age," continued Aunt Sarah; "a truly feminine occupation, and as I one time heard a wise old physician remark, 'Soothing to the nerves,' which I know to be true, having knitted many a worry into the heel of a sock. I learned at an early age the value of money, and once having acquired the saving habit, it is not possible to be wasteful in later life."</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXV.</hd><hd align="center">AN ELBADRITCHEL HUNT.</hd><p>Fritz Schmidt, like many another Bucks County boy, had frequently heard the rural tale of a mythical bird called the "Elbadritchel," supposed to be abroad, particularly on cold, dark, stormy nights, when the wind whistled and blew perfect gales around exposed corners of houses and barns. 'Twas a common saying among "Pennsylvania Germans," at such times, " 'Tis a fine night to catch 'Elbadritchels.' "</p>
<illustration><caption>CATCHING ELBADRITCHELS</caption><description>A picture of a man standing near a crop field with a board in his hands.</description>

Have you ever seen an "Elbadritchel ?" No one has to my certain knowledge so I cannot vouch for the truth of this description of it.</p><p>Fritz Schmidt had never thought to question the truth of the tale. So, when one cold, stormy night several boys from neighboring<pb n="137" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=173"/> farms drove up to the Schmidt homestead and asked Fritz to join them in a hunt for "Elbadritchels," he unhesitatingly agreed to make one of the number, unaware that he had been selected as the victim of a practical joke, and, as usual, was one of the jolliest of the crowd. They drove through a blinding downpour of rain and dismounted on reaching a lonely hill about three miles distant. They gave Fritz a bag to hold. It was fashioned of burlap and barrel hoops, inside of which they placed a lighted candle, and Fritz was instructed how to hold it in order to attract the "Elbadritchel." They also gave him a club with which to strike the bird when it should appear.</p><p>The boys scampered off in different directions, ostensibly to chase up the birds, but in reality they clambered into the waiting wagon and were rapidly driven home, leaving Fritz alone awaiting the coming of the "Elbadritchel." When Fritz realized the trick played on him, his feelings may be better imagined than described. He trudged home, cold and tired, vowing vengeance on the boys, fully resolved to get even with them.</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXVI.</hd><hd align="center">THE OLD SHANGHAI ROOSTER.</hd><p>Much of Aunt Sarah's spare time was devoted to her chickens, which fully repaid her for the care given them. She was not particular about fancy stock, but had quite a variety-White Leghorns, Brown Leghorns, big, fat, motherly old Brahma hens that had raised a brood of as many as thirty-five little chicks at one time, a few snow-white, large Plymouth Rocks and some gray Barred one. The 
<emph rend="italic">latter</emph> she 
<emph rend="italic">liked</emph> particularly because she said they were much more talkative than any of the others; they certainly did appear to chatter to her when she fed them. She gave them clean, comfortable quarters, warm bran mash on cold winter mornings, alternating with cracked corn and "scratch feed" composed of a mixture of cracked corn, wheat and buckwheat, scattered over a litter of dried leaves on the floor of the chicken house, so they were obliged to work hard for their food.</p>
<illustration><caption>Old Egg Basket</caption><description>A picture of a basket of eggs.</description>
</illustration><p>A plentiful supply of fresh water was always at hand, as well as cracked oyster shell. She also fed the chickens all scraps from the table, cutting all meat scraps fine with an old pair of scissors hung conveniently in the kitchen.</p><p>She was very successful with the little chicks hatched out when she "set" a hen and the yield of eggs from her hens was usually greater and the eggs larger in size than those of any of her neighbors. This I attribute to her excellent care of them, generous diet, but principally to the fact of the elimination of all the roosters among the flock during the season between the "first of May and December first," with one exception. "Brigham," an<pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=175"/> immensely large, old, red Shanghai rooster, a most pompous and dignified old chap. A special pet of Aunt Sarah's, she having raised him from a valuable "setting" of eggs given her, and as the egg from which "Brigham," as he was called, emerged, was the only one of the lot which proved fertile, he was valued accordingly and given a longer lease of life than the other roosters, and was usually either confined or allowed to roam outside the chicken yard during the summer months; in the winter, being a swift runner, he usually gobbled up two shares of food before the hens arrived. That accounted for his great size. The old rooster was also noted for his loud crowing.</p><p>One day in early Spring, John Landis came into the house hurriedly, saying, "Sarah, your old Shanghai rooster is sick."</p><p>"Yes," answered his wife, "I missed hearing him crow this morning; he is usually as regular as an alarm clock."</p><p>She hurried to the barnyard, picked up poor Brigham, wrapped him carefully in a piece of blanket and laid him in a small shed. The next morning she was awakened by the lusty crowing of Brigham, who was apparently as well as ever. The next day the same thing happened. Aunt Sarah found him, as she supposed, in a dying condition, and the following morning he was fully recovered. It was quite puzzling until one day John Landis came into the kitchen laughing heartily and said, "Sarah, I am sorry to inform you of the intemperate habits of your pet, Brigham. He is a most disreputable old fellow, and has a liking for liquor. He has been eating some of the brandied cherries which were thrown into the barnyard when the jug containing them was accidentally broken at house cleaning time.</p><p>"Well, Sarah, old Brigham was not sick at all-only "ingloriously' drunk." In the fall of the same year Aunt Sarah spied Brigham one day on top of one of the cider barrels in the shed busily engaged eating the pummace which issued from the bung-hole of the barrel. John Landis, on hearing of Brigham's last escapade, decided, as the rooster was large as an ordinary turkey, to serve him roasted at Mary's wedding.</p><p>Fritz Schmidt remarked one day in the presence of Sibylla: "Chickens must possess some little intelligence; they know enough to go to bed early. Yes, and without an 'alarm clock,' too, Sibylla, eh?"</p><p>She walked away without a word to Fritz. The alarm clock<pb n="140" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=176"/> was a sore subject with her, and one about which she had nothing to say. Sibylla had never quite forgiven Fritz for the prank played on her. He, happening to hear John Landis tell Sibylla a certain hour he thought a proper time for Jake Crouthamel to take his departure Sunday evenings, Fritz conceived the brilliant (?) idea of setting the alarm clock to "go off" quite early in the evening. He placed the clock at the head of the stairs, and in the midst of an interesting conversation between the lovers the alarm sounded with a loud, whizzing noise, which naturally made quicktempered Sibylla very angry. She said on seeing Fritz the next morning: "It was not necessary to set the 'waker' to go off, as I know enough to send 'Chake' home when it's time."</p><p>Fritz, happening to tell the story to the editor of a small German Mennonite paper, edited in a near-by town, it was printed in that paper in German, which caused Sibylla, on hearing it, to be still more angry at the Professor's son.</p>

Aunt Sarah's rye bread invariably captured first prize, and she proposed sending both bread and cake with Sibylla and Jake, who never missed a picnic or fair within a radius of one hundred miles.</p>
<illustration><caption>"POTATO PRETZEL"</caption><description>A picture of a first prize winning potato pretzel.</description>
</illustration><p>Mary set a sponge the evening of the day preceding that of the picnic, using recipe for "Perfection Potato Cake," which Aunt Sarah considered her best recipe for raised cakes, as 'twas one used by her mother for many years.</p><p>On the ray of the picnic, Mary arose at five o'clock, and while her Aunt was busily engaged setting sponge for her loaf of rye bread, Mary kneaded down the "potato cake" sponge, set to<pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=178"/> rise the previous evening, now rounded over top of bowl and light as a feather.</p><p>She filled a couple of pans with buns, molded from the dough, and set them to rise. She then, under her Aunt's direction, fashioned the "Pretzel" as follows: She placed a piece of the raised dough on a large, well-floured bake board, rolled it over and over with both hands until a long, narrow roll or strip was formed about the width of two fingers in thickness and placed this strip carefully on the baking sheet, which was similar to the one on which Aunt Sarah baked rye bread; shaped the dough to form a figure eight (8) or pretzel, allowing about two inches of space on either side of baking sheet to allow for raising. She then cut a piece of dough into three portions, rolled each as thick as a finger, braided or plaited the three strips together and placed carefully on top of the figure eight, or pretzel, not meeting by a space of about two inches. This braided piece on the top should not be quite as thick as bottom or first piece of the pretzel. She then rolled three small pieces of dough into tiny strips or rolls the size of small lead pencils, wound them round and round and round into small scrolls, moistened the lower side with water to cause them to adhere, and placed them on the dividing line between the two halves of the figure eight. She placed an old china coffee cup without a handle, buttered on outside, in centre of each half of the figure eight, which kept the pretzel from spreading over the pan. With a small, new paint brush she brushed over the top of Pretzel and Buns, a mixture, consisting of one yolk of egg, an equal quantity of cream or milk (which should be lukewarm so as not to chill the raised dough) and one tablespoon of sugar. This causes the cakes, etc., to be a rich brown when baked, a result to be obtained in no other manner.</p><p>When the pretzel was raised and had doubled in size 'twas baked in a moderately hot oven.</p><p>Mary's surprise and delight may easily be imagined when Sibylla, on her return from the picnic, handed her the prize she had won, a two-pound box of chocolates, remarking, "Mary, you and Aunt Sarah both got a prize-her's is in the box what Jake's got."</p><p>The box on being opened by Aunt Sarah contained a very pretty, silver-plated soup ladle, the prize offered for the best loaf of rye bread.</p><pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=179"/><p>"Aunt Sarah," inquired Mary one day, "do you think it pays a housekeeper to bake her own bread?"</p><p>"Certainly, it pays, my dear. From a barrel of flour may be baked three hundred or more one-pound loaves of bread; should you pay five cents a loaf, the bread which may be made from one barrel of flour if bought from a bake shop would cost you fifteen dollars. Now, you add to the cost of a barrel of flour a couple of dollars for yeast, salt, etc, which altogether would not possibly be more than ten dollars, and you see the housewife has saved five dollars. It is true it is extra work for the housewife, but good,

From the bread sponge may be made such a number of good, plain cakes by the addition of currants or raisins, which are more wholesome and cheaper than richer cakes."</p><p>"I think what you say is true, Aunt Sarah," said Mary.</p><p>"Frau Schmidt always bakes her own bread, and she tells me she sets a sponge or batter for white bread, and by the addition<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=180"/> of Graham flour, cornmcal or oatmeal, always has a variety on her table with a small expenditure of time and money."</p>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXVIII.</hd><hd align="center">FAITHFUL SERVICE.</hd><p>The home-making instinct was so strongly developed in Mary that her share in the labor of cooking and baking became a pleasure. Occasionally she had failures-what inexperienced cook has not?-yet they served only to spur her on to fresh efforts. She had several small scars on her wrist caused by her arm coming in contact with the hot oven when baking. She laughingly explained: "One bar on my arm represents that delicious 'Brod Torte' which Frau Schmidt taught me to bake; the other one I acquired when removing the sponge cake from the oven which Uncle John said 'equaled Aunt Sarah's' (which I consider highest praise), and the third bar received when taking from the oven the 'Lemon Meringue,' Ralph's favorite pie. which he pronounced 'fine, almost too good to eat.'" Mary was as proud of her scars as a young, non-commissioned officer of the chevron on his sleeve, won by deeds of valor.</p><p>The lessons Mary learned that summer on the farm while filling her hope chest and preparing her mind for wifehood were of inestimable value to her in later years. She learned not only to bake, brew and keep house, but from constant association with her Aunt she acquired a self-poise, a calm, serene manner, the value of which is beyond price in this swift, restless age.</p><p>One day, while having a little heart-to-heart talk with Mary, her Aunt said: "My dear, never allow an opportunity to pass for doing a kind act. If ever so small, it may cheer some sad, lonely heart. Don't wait to do 
<emph rend="italic">big things.</emph> The time may never come. If only a kind word, speak it at once. Kind words cost so little, and we should all be more prodigal with them; and to a tired, sad, discouraged soul, a kind word or act means so very much; and who is there that has not at some time in life known sorrow and felt the need of sympathy? Were our lives all sunshine we could not feel in touch with sorrowing friends. How natural it is for our hearts to go out in sympathy to the one who says 'I have suffered.'<pb n="146" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=182"/> Give to your friend the warm hand-clasp and cheery greeting which cost us nothign in the giving. 'Tis the little lifts which help us over stones in our pathway through life. We think our cross the heaviest when, did we but know the weight of others, we'd not willingly exchange; and remember Mary, 'there are not crown-bearers in Heaven that were not cross-bearers below.' Have you ever read the poem, 'The Changed Cross?' No? Well, I will give it to you to copy in your book of recipes. Should you ever, in future years, feel your cross too heavy to bear, read the poem. How many brave, cheery little women greet us with a smile as they pass. But little do we or any one realize that instead of a song in their hearts the smiles on their lips conceal troubles the world does not suspect, seeking to forget their own sorrows while diong kindly acts for others. They are the real heroes whom the world does not reward with medals for bravery. 'To stand with a smile upon your face against a stake from which you cannot get away, that, no doubt, is heroic; but the true glory is not resignation to the inevitable.

It was "Big Thursday" of Fair week. They started quite early, long before Ralph Jackson, who had come from the city the day previous, to tkae Mary to the Fair, had arisen.</p>

</illustration><p>Mary, while appreciating Sibylla's good qualities, never failed to be amused at her broad "Pennsylvania German" dialect.</p><p>The morning of the "Fair," Mary arose earlier than usual to allow Sibylla and Jake to get an early start, as it was quite a distance from the farm to the Fair grounds. As they were about to drive away, Sibylla, alighting from the carriage, said, "I forgot<pb n="152" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=188"/> my 'Schnupftuch.' " Returning with it in her hand, she called, as she climbed into Jake's buggy, "Gut-by, Mary, it looks fer rain."</p><p>"Yes," said Jake, "I think it gives rain before we get back yet The cornfodder in the barn this morning was damp like it had water on it."</p><p>And said Mary, "The fragrance of the flowers was particularly noticeable early this morning." Jake, as it happened, was no false prophet. It did rain before evening.</p><p>Later in the day, Mary and Ralph drove to a near-by town, leaving horse and carriage at the hotel until their return in the evening, and boarded a train for Allentown. On arriving there, they decided to walk up Hamilton Street, and later take a car out to the Fair grounds. As they sauntered slowly up the main street, Mary noticed a small church built between two large department stores and stopped to read a tablet on the church, which informed the passerby that "this is to commemorate the concealment of the Liberty Bell during the Revolutionary War. This tablet was erected by the Liberty Bell Chapter of the Daughters of the Revolution."</p><p>The First Zion's Reformed Church was founded in 1762. In front of the Church a rough block of granite, erected to the memory of John Jacob Mickley, contained the following inscription:"In commemoration of the saving of the Liberty Bell from the British in 1777, Under cover of darkness and with his farm team, he, John Mickley, hauled the Liberty Bell from Independence Hall, Philadelphia, through the British lines, to Bethlehem, where the wagon broke down. The Bell was transferred to another wagon, brought to Allentown, placed beneath the floor of the Second Church building of Zion's Reformed Church, where it remained secreted nearly a year. This 
<emph rend="italic">tablet</emph> was placed by the order of the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, June 2nd, 1907, under the auspices of the Pennsylvania Daughters of the Revolution."</p><p>This was all very interesting to a girl who had been born and reared in Philadelphia; one who in earliest childhood had been taught to love and venerate the "old Bell."</p><p>Ralph was quite as interested in reading about the old Bell as was Mary, and said: "Did you know that the City of Philadelphia purchased the State House property which included the Bell, in 1818, in consideration of the sum of seventy thousand<pb n="153" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=189"/> dollars? No building is ever to be erected on the ground inside the wall on the south side of the State House, but if is to remain a public green and walk forever?"</p>
<illustration><caption>Liberty Bell Tablet, Zion's Reformed Church, Allentown, Pa.</caption><description>A picture of a large upright stone with a plaque on the front. The stone is under a canopy made from draped American flags.</description>
</illustration><p>"No," replied Mary, "I did not know that. I don't think we will see anything of greater interest than this at the Fair."</p><p>"I understand," said Ralph, "this is the third church building<pb n="154" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=190"/> built on this site, where the original church stood in which the Bell was secreted."</p><p>Mary, possessing a fair share of the curiosity usually attributed to the female of the species," on noticing the church door standing ajar, asked Ralph to step inside with her, thinking to find the caretaker within; but no one was visible. A deep silence reigned in the cool, dim interior of the House of God.</p><p>One could almost feel the silence, 'twas so impressive. Slowly they walked up the wide church aisle and stood before the quaint baptismal font. A stray sunbeam glancing through one of the beautiful, variously-colored memorial windows, lighted up the pictured saint-like faces over the chancel, making them appear as if imbued with life. Mary softly whispered to Ralph, as if loath to profane the sacredness of the place by loud talking, "I seem to hear a voice saying, 'The Lord is in His holy temple.' " Quietly retracing their steps, they, without meeting any one, emerged into the bright sunlight and were soon in the midst of the turmoil and traffic incident to the principal business street of a city.</p><p>The young folks boarded a trolley and in a short time reached the Fair grounds, which offered many attractions to Ralph as well as Mary. The latter was interested in the fine display of needlework, fruits, flowers and vegetables of unusual size. Aunt Sarah's bread won a prize. A blue ribbon attached to Frau Schmidt's highly-prized, old-fashioned, patchwork quilt, showed it to be a winner. Ralph, being interested in the pens of fancy chickens, prize cattle, etc., Mary reluctantly left the woman's department of fancy work, and other interesting things, and accompanied him. On their way to the outlying cattle sheds they noticed two lovers silting on a bench. Upon a second glance they were convinced that it was Jake and Sibylla. Jake, beaming with happiness, said, "Sibylla vos side by me yet?" They were busily engaged eating a lunch consisting of rolls with hot "weiners" between the two halves, or, as Jake called them, "Doggies," munching pretzels and peanuts between sips of strong coffee, both supremely happy. A yearly visit to the Allentown Fair on "Big Thursday." was the event in their dull, prosaic lives.</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=191"/>

<chapter><hd align="center" size="larger">CHAPTER XXX.</hd><hd align="center">FRITZ SCHMIDT EXPLORES DURHAM CAVE.</hd><p>It appeared to be nothing new for Fritz Schmidt to get into frost, he, in company with a number of boys, drove to Durham. not many miles distant from his home, in search of persimmons. the crop of which, on account of the severity of the preceding winter, old farmers had predicted would be exceedingly heavy.</p><p>Fritz did not tell the boys of his intention to explore a cave which he had been told was in the neighborhood, thinking it would be a good joke to explore the cave first, then tell the boys later of his adventure.</p><p>The old gentleman from whom Fritz gained his information relative to the cave aroused the boy's curiosity by saying, "Very many years ago, a skeleton was found in Durham cave and one of the bones, on examination, proved to be the thigh bone of a human being. How he came there, or the manner of his death, was never known." I large room in the cave is known as "Queen Esther's Drawing Room," where, tradition has it "Queen Esther," or Catharine Montour, which was her rightful name, at one time inhabited this cave with some of her Indian followers.</p><p>Fritz accidentally stumbled upon the mouth of the cave. None of the other boys being in sight, Fritz quickly descended into the cave, which was dark as night. By lighting a second match as quickly as one was burned, he explored quite a distance, when, accidentally dropping his box of matches, the burning match in his hand, at the same moment, flickered faintly, then went out, leaving Fritz in darkness. Imagine the feelings of the boy, as he groped unsuccessfully on the floor of the cavern for the lost match box. Finally, he gave up in despair. Fritz was not a cowardly boy, but while searching for the matches, he, without thinking, had turned around several times, lost his bearings and knew not in which direction to go to reach the opening of the cave. He heard strange noises which he imagined were bats flopping their wings.</p><pb n="156" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=194"/><p>There appeared to be something uncanny about the place, and Fritz devoutly wished himself out in the sunshine, when the quotation he had frequently heard his father use came into his mind; "More things are wrought by prayer as he had been taught to pray at his mother's knee, but more earnestly than he had ever prayed before his life, that God would help him find his way out of the cave, believing that his prayer would be answered. And who shall say it was not answered? For, stumbling onward in the darkness, not knowing if he were coming toward the cave's entrance or going in the opposite direction, he eventually hailed with joy a faint streak of light which he followed, and it soon brought him to the mouth of the cave. He was surprised on joining his companions to find they had not been alarmed at his absence. He had been in the cave only thirty minutes, but to him it had seemed hours. Fritz says to this day he has a horror of Durham Cave or "The Devil's Hole," as it was formerly called.</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=195"/>

<chapter><pb n="157" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=197"/><hd align="center">CHAPTER XXXI.</hd><hd align="center">MARY'S MARRIAGE.</hd><p>His vacation ended, after a busy season at the farm, Ralph Jackson returned to his work in the city, strong and robust. He had acquired the coat of tan which Mary's Uncle had predicted. Physically strong as the "Cave Man" of old, he felt capable of moving mountains, and as was natural, he being only a human man, longed for the mate he felt God had intended should one day be his, as men have done since our first gardener, Adam, and will continue to do until the end of time.</p><p>When visiting the farm, an event which occurred about every two weeks, Ralph constantly importuned Mary to name an early day for their marriage.</p><p>Mary, with a young girl's impulsiveness, had given her heart unreservedly into the keeping of Ralph Jackson, her first sweet-heart. Mary was not natually cold or unresponsive, neither was she lacking in passion. She had had a healthy girlhood, and a wholesome home life. She had been taught the conventional ideals of the marriage relations that have kept the race strong throughout the centuries. Mary possessed great strengh of character and fine moral courage. Frequently, not wishing to show her real feeling for the young mam; too well poised to be carried off into the wrong channel, defended and excused by many over-sentimental and light-hearted novelists of the day, she sometimes appeared almost indifferent to the impetuous youth with warm, red blood leaping in his veins, who desired so ardently to possess her.</p><p>Mary's Aunt had taught her the sancity of parenthood, also that women are not always the weaker sex. There are times when they must show their superiority to "mere man" in being the stronger of the two, mentally if not physically, and Ralph Jackson knew when he called Mary "wite" she would endow him with all the wealth of her pure womanhood, sacredly kept for the clean-souled<pb n="158" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=198"/> young man, whose devotion she finally rewarded by promising to marry him the second week in October.</p><p>Sibylla Linsabigler, a good but ignorant girl, accustomed to hearing her elder brothers speak slightingly regarding the sanctity of love and marriage, was greatly attached to Mary, whom she admired exceedingly, and looked up to almost as a superior being. She unconsciously imitated many of Mary's ways and mannerisms, and sought to adopt her higher ideals of life and standard of morals.</p><p>One Sunday, as Jake Crouthamel was spending the evening with Sibylla, as was his usual custom, he attempted some slight familiarity, which annoyed Sibylla greatly. Jake, noticing the young girl's displeasure at his action, remarked, "I think me Sibylla, you are stuck up yet" (a grave fault in the Bucks County farm hand's opinion).</p><p>"No, Chake," Sibylla replied, "I ain't, but Mary, she say a man gives a girl more respect what keeps herself to herself before she is married, and I lofe you Chake and want that you respect me if we marry.</p><p>Fritz and Elizabeth Schmidt, on hearing the news of Mary's approaching marriage, promptly begged the privilege of decorat-ing the old farm house parlor for the expected ceremony. They scoured the surrounding woods and countryside for decorations; along old stone fences and among shrubbery by the roadside they gathered large branches of Bitter Sweet. Its racemes of orange-colored fruit, which later in the season becomes beautiful, when the orange gives place to a brilliant red, the outer covering of the berry turns back upon the stems, forming one of the prettiest pictures imaginable in late Autumn, They also gathered branches of feathery wild clematis, which, after the petals had fallen, resembled nothing so much as a cluster of apple seeds, each seed tipped with what appeared like a tiny osprey feather. From the woods near the farm they gathered quantities of trailing ground pine and rainbow-tinted leaves from the numerous brilliant scarlet and yellow maples, which appeared brighter in contrast to the sober-hued trees of shellbark, oak and chestnut.</p><p>The wedding gifts sent to Mary were odd, useful and numerous. The Campfire Girls, to whom she became endeared, gave her a "Kitchen Shower," consisting of a clothes basket (woven by an old basketmaker from the willows growing not far distant)-<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=199"/>

Mary laughingly told Sibylla she thought when 'twas placed on her kitchen doorstep she'd ask every one to please step over it, as it was too pretty to be trod on, which greatly pleased the young girl, who had spent many hours of loving thought and labor on the simple, inexpensive gift.</p><p>Mary received from Professor Schmidt a small but excellent copy of one of the world's most famous pictures, "The Night Watch," painted by Rembrandt, in 1642.</p><p>"My dear," said the old Professor, "I saw what was said to be the original of this painting, the property of Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. It was in a small, separate building. The size of the picture was fifteen feet by twenty feet. It is the largest and best known of Rembrandt's works. It acquired the wrong title of 'Night Watch' in a period when, owing to the numerous coats of vanish and the effect of smoke and dust, it had gotten so dark in appearance that only the most lucid parts could be discerned. Nowadays, nobody doubts-that the light falling from the left on the boisterous company is that of the sun. The musketeers are remarching out of the high archway of their hall, crossing the street in front of it, and going up a bridge. The architecture of the building is a product of Rembrandt's imagination. The steps, also, which we see the men descending, were put there simply to make those at the back show out above those in the front ranks. The march out was to he above all a portrait group. Sixteen persons had each paid their contributions, a hundred guilders on the average, to have their likenesses transmitted to posterity, and every one of them was therefore to be fully visible."</p><p>"It is certainly a wonderful picture," said Mary, "and while I have seen few pictures painted by old masters, I think, even with my limited knowledge of art, I cannot fail to appreciate this excellent<pb n="160" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=202"/> cellent copy, and I thank you heartily, Professor, and shall always be reminded of you when I look at this copy of a great work."</p><p>Mary would not go empty-handed to Ralph at her marriage. Her "hope chest" in the attic was full to overflowing, and quite unique in itself, as it consisted of an old, in fact ancient, wooden dough-tray used in times past by Aunt Sarah's grandmother. Beside it stood a sewing table, consisting of three discarded broom handles supporting a cheese-box cover, with wooden cheese-box underneath for holding Mary's sewing; stained brown and cre-lonne lined. Mary valued it as the result of the combined labor of herself and Ralph Jackson. A roll of new, home-made rag carpet, patchwork quilts and "New Colonial" rugs, jars of fruit, dried sweet corn, home-made soap, crocks of apple butter, jellies, jams and canned vegetables all bore evidence of Mary's busy summer at the farm.</p><p>The day of Mary's marriage, the twelfth of October, dawned clear and bright, sunshine warm as a day in June. In the centre of the gayly-decorated old farm house parlor, wearing a simple, little, inexpensive dress of soft, creamy muslin, we find Mary standing beside Ralph, who is looking supremely satisfied and happy, although a trifle pale and nervous, listening to the solemn words of the minister. Ralph's "I will" sounded clearly and distinctly through the long room. Mary, with a sweet, serious, faraway look in her blue eyes, repeated slowly after the minister, "I promise to love, honor and"-then a long pause. She glanced shyly up at the young man by her side as if to make sure he was worth it, then in a low, clear tone, added, "obey."</p><p>Ralph Jackson certainly deserved the appellation "Cave Man" given him by Fritz Schmidt. He was considerably more than six feet in height, with broad, square shoulders, good features, a clear brain and a sound body. He had never used intoxicants of any description. He sometimes appeared quite boyish in his ways, for on account of his matured look and great size he was frequently judged to be older than he really was.</p><p>Aunt Sarah had provided a bounteous repast for the few friends assembled, and while looking after the comfort of her guests tears dimmed the kindly, gray eyes at the thought of parting from Mary.</p><p>Small Polly Schmidt, as flower girl at the wedding, was so excited she scarcely knew if she should laugh or cry, and finally<pb n="161" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=203"/> compromised by giving Mary what she called a "bear hug," much to Mary's amusement. Fritz gravely said:"Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Jackson," and turning to Mary," I wish you a beautiful and happy life, Mrs. Jackson." Mary blushed becomingly on hearing her new name for the first time.</p><p>Bidding farewell to friends, Mary and Ralph, accompanied by her Uncle, were driven by "Chake" to the depot in a near-by town, where they boarded the train for the little, newly-furnished home in the suburbs of Philadelphia, the deed of which was Mary's wedding gift from her Uncle, in appreciation of her faithful service on the farm during the summer and for the brightness she had brought into his life and the lives of those with whom she had come in contact, as every one at the farm had felt the captivating charm and winning sweetness of the young girl.</p><p>As the train came in sight, the old gentleman, in a voice husky with emotion, bade the young couple, just starting the journey of life together, an affectionate farewell, and repeated solemnly, almost as a benediction, "Es Salamu Aleikum."</p><pb n="162" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=204"/>

<section><hd align="center">SMALL ECONOMIES, "LEFT-OVERS" OR "IVERICH BLEIBST"<lb/>AS AUNT SARAH CALLED THEM.</hd><p>"The young housewife," said Aunt Sarah to Mary, in a little talk on small economies in the household, "should never throw away pieces of hard cheese. Grate them and keep in a cool, dry place until wanted, then spread lightly over the top of a dish of macaroni, before baking; or sprinkle over small pieces of dough remaining after baking pies, roll thin, cut in narrow strips like straws, and bake light brown in a hot oven, as 'Cheese Straws.'"</p><p>Wash and dry celery tips in oven, and when not wished for soup they may be used later for seasoning. The undesirable outer leaves of a head of lettuce, if fresh and green, may be used if cut fine with scissors, and a German salad dressing added. The heart of lettuce should, after washing carefully, be placed in a piece of damp cheese cloth and put on ice until wanted, then served at table "au natural," with olive oil and vinegar or mayonnaise dressing to suit individual taste. Should you have a large quantity of celery, trim and carefully wash the roots, cut them fine and add to soup as flavoring. Almost all vegetables may be, when well cooked, finely mashed, strained, and when added to stock, form a nourishing soup by the addition of previously-cooked rice or barley. Add small pieces of meat, well-washed bones cut from steaks or roasts, to the stock pot Small pieces of ham or bacon (left-overs), also bacon or ham

Mix thoroughly, cook a minute and stand away in a cool place. Young housekeepers will be surprised at the many vegetables, frequently left-overs, from which appetizing salads may be made by the addition of a couple tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise, besides nut meats, lettuce, watercress, celery and fruit, all of which may be used to advantage. A good potato salad is one of the cheapest and most easily prepared salads. A German dressing for dandelions, lettuce or potatoes may be prepared in a few minutes by adding a couple of tablespoonfuls of salad dressing (which the forehanded housewife will always keep on hand) to little hot ham or bacon gravy. Stirring it while hot over the salad and serving at once.</p><p>A cup of mashed potatoes, left over from dinner, covered and set aside in a cool place, may be used the next day, with either milk or potato water, to set a sponge for "Dutch Cake" or cinnamon buns with equally good results as if they had been freshly boiled (if the potatoes be heated luke-warm and mashed through a sieve); besides the various other ways in which cold boiled potatoes may be used.</p><p>Fruit juices or a couple tablespoonfuls of tart jelly or preserved fruit may be added to mincemeat with advantage. Housewives should make an effort to give their family good, plain, nourishing, wholesome food. The health of the family depends so largely on the quality of food consumed. When not having time, strength or inclination to bake cake, pies or puddings, have instead good, sweet, home-made bread and fruit; if nothing else, serve stewed fruit or apple sauce. Omit meat occasionally from the bill of fare and serve instead a dish of macaroni and cheese and fruit instead of other dessert. Serve a large, rich, creamy rice pudding for the children's lunch. When eggs are cheap and plentiful make simple custards, old-fashioned cornmeal puddings, tapioca, bread puddings and gelatine with fruits. These are all good, wholesome, and not expensive, and in Summer may be prepared in the cool of the early morning with small outlay of time, labor or money. Plan your housework well the day before and have<pb n="164" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=208"/> everything in readiness. The pudding may be placed in the oven and baked while preparing breakfast, economizing coal and the time required for other household duties.</p><p>Every wife and mother who does her own housework and cooking these days (and their number is legion) knows the satisfaction one experiences, especially in hot weather, in having dinner and luncheon planned and partly prepared early in the morning before leaving the kitchen to perform other household tasks.</p><p>Another small economy of Aunt Sarah's was the utilizing of cold mashed potatoes in an appetizing manner. The mashed potatoes remaining from a former meal were put through a small fruit press or ricer to make them light and flacky. To one heaped cup of mashed potatoes (measured before pressing them through a small fruit press) she added 3/4 cup of soft, stale bread crums, 1/4 cup of flour sifted with 1/4 teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix in lightly with a fork yolk of one egg, then the stiffly beaten white, seasoned with salt and a little minced onion or parsley, or both. With well-floured hands she molded the mixture into balls the size of a shelled walnut, dropped into rapidly boiling water and cooked them uncovered from 15 to 20 minutes, then skimmed them from the water and browned in a pan with a little butter and served on platter with meat, a pot roast or beef preferred. From the above quantity of potatoes was made five potato balls.</p>

The <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or wafer used to mix with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> for making <ingredient>bread</ingredient> sponge should be lukewarm. If too hot, the loaves will be full of holes and coarse grained. If too cold the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> chilled, will not rise as it should have done had the liquid used been the right temperature. Good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made by using <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>potato water</ingredient> or <ingredient>whey</ingredient> (drained from <ingredient>thick sour milk</ingredient>), and good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made by simply using <ingredient>lukewarm water.</ingredient> I prefer a mixture of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> to set sponge. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> makes a finegrained, <ingredient>white bread,</ingredient> but it soon dries out and becomes stale. <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> rises more slowly when <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is used. When<pb n="168" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=212"/> mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> are used, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> keeps moist a longer time.

These are usually kept in a large refrigerator in a temperature of 44 degrees and should not be kept longer in the home than three days in Summer or six days in Winter, and should always be kept in a cool place until used, if the cook would have success when using.</p><p>Use the best <ingredient>hard,</ingredient> Spring <ingredient>wheat flour</ingredient> obtainable for baking <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or any sponge raised with <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> as this <ingredient>flour</ingredient> contains a greater quantity of gluten and makes <ingredient>bread</ingredient> of high nutritive value.</p><p><ingredient>Winter wheat</ingredient> maybe used for cake-making and for baking pastry with excellent results, although costing less than Spring <ingredient>wheat.</ingredient></p><p>Always sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before using, when setting sponge for <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> "Aunt Sarah" always cut several gashes with a sharp knife on top of loaves when ready to be placed in oven. She also made several cuts across the top of loaves with a hot knife when set to rise to allow gas to escape. If an impression made on a loaf of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> with the finger remains, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is light. If the dent disappears, then the loaf is not light enough to be placed in the oven; give it more time to rise. An experienced cook, noted for the excellence and size of her loaves of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> said she always inverted a pan over the pan containing loaves of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> when set to rise, and allowed the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to remain covered after being placed in the oven. Loaves will rise to a greater height if this is done. Remove the covering to allow loaves to brown a short time before taking them from the oven. "Aunt Sarah" frequently placed four loaves in her large roasting pan, covered the pan, when set to rise, and allowed the cover to remain until loaves Were nearly baked. She brushed the top and sides of loaves with melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> When set to rise to allow of their being broken apart easily. A more crusty loaf is secured by placing each loaf singly in medium-sized <ingredient>bread</ingredient> tins.</p><p>Aunt Sarah considered Fleischrnan's compressed <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> the best commercial <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in use, both quick and reliable, but thought better <ingredient>bread</ingredient> was never made than that made by her mother, as<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=213"/> she had been taught to make it in years past, by the old-fashioned and slower "sponge method." She was invariably successful in making sweet, wholesome <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in that manner. She used homemade <ingredient>potato yeast</ingredient> or "<ingredient>cornmeal yeast cakes,</ingredient>" under different names, always with good results.</p><p>Good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made either by the old-fashioned "sponge" method or "straight." Sponge method consists of a batter mixed from liquid <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> (usually home-made <ingredient>potato yeast</ingredient> is used) and a small part of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> required for making the <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> This batter was usually set to rise at night and mixed up in the centre of a quantity of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> in an old-fashioned wooden dough tray. The following morning enough <ingredient>flour</ingredient> was kneaded in to form a dough, and when well-raised and light, this dough was formed into loaves and placed in pans for the final rising. The more easily and more quickly made "straight" dough, when using Fleischman's compressed <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> is mixed in the morning and all the ingredients necessary are added at one time. It is then set to rise and, when the dough has doubled in bulk, it is kneaded down and when risen to once and half its size, shaped into loaves, placed in pans to rise and, when risen to top of pans, bake.</p><p>Better <ingredient>bread</ingredient> may be made from <ingredient>flour</ingredient> not freshly milled. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should be kept in a dry place; it improves with moderate age. Stand <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in a warm place to dry out several hours before , using if you would have good <ingredient>bread.</ingredient></p><p>When baking <ingredient>bread</ingredient> the heat of the oven should not he too great at 
<emph rend="italic">first</emph>, or the outside of the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will harden too quickly and inside the loaves will not be thoroughly baked before the crust is thick and dark. The temperature of the oven and time required for baking depend upon the size of the loaves, yet the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be placed in rather a quick oven, one in which the loaves should brown in about fifteen minutes, when the heat may be reduced, finishing the baking more slowly.</p><p>Small <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> and rolls can stand a much hotter oven and quicker baking than large loaves, which must be heated slowly, and baked a longer time. A one-pound loaf should bake about one hour. On being taken from the oven, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be placed on a sieve so that the air can circulate about it until it is thoroughly cooled. In the

The greatest care should be used in preparing<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=214"/> and baking the dough and in cooking and keeping the finished <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Though good housekeepers agree that light, well-raised <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can readily be made, with reasonable care and attention, heavy, badly-rasied <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is unfortunately every common. Such <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is not palatable and is generally considered to be unwholesome, and probably more indigestion has been caused by it than by any other badly-cooked food. As compared with most <ingredient>meats</ingredient> and vegetables, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> has practically no waste and is very completely digested, but it is usually too poor in proteins to be fittingly used as the <ingredient>sole</ingredient> article of diet, but when eaten with due quantities of other food, it is invaluable and well deserves its title of "Staff of Life."</p><p>When the housewife "sets" <ingredient>bread</ingredient> sponge to rise over night, she should mix the sponge or dough quite late, and early in the morning mold it at once into shapely-looking loaves (should the sponge have had the necessary amount of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> added the night before for making a stiff dough).</p><p>Being aware of the great nutritive value of <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>dried currants.</ingredient> Aunt Sarah frequently added a cup of either one or the other, well-<ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed, to the dough when shaping into loaves for the final rising.</p><p>Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> when baking on account of its being more economical, and for the reason that a lesser quantity of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> may be used; the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> qualities being greater than that of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The taste of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> was never detected in her <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or cakes, they being noted for their excellence, as the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> she used was home-rendered, almost as sweet as dairy <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> free from taste or odor of <ingredient>pork.</ingredient> She always beat <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> when using it for baking cakes, and salted it well before using, and I do not think the small quantity used could be objected to on hygienic priciples.</p><p>I have read "<ingredient>bread</ingredient> baking" is done once every three or four weeks, no oftener, in some of the farm houses of Central Europe, and yet <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> is there unknown.

The three edges of the sheet iron turned down all around to a depth of half an inch, the two opposite corners being cut off about a half inch, to allow of its being turned down. It is a great convenience for young housewives to possess two of these sheet-iron tins, or "baking sheets," when baking small cakes or cookies, as being raised slightly from the bottom of the oven, cakes are less liable to scorch and bake more evenly. One sheet may be filled while baking another sheetful of cakes. In this manner a large number of cakes may be baked in a short time.

<emph rend="italic">warmed</emph> <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mixing the foamy <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> with a 
<emph rend="italic">portion</emph> of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to make a soft sponge, leaving a wall of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> around the inside edge of bowl, as our grandmothers used to do in olden times when they mixed a sponge for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> of liquid <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> in one end of the old-fashioned wooden "dough tray," using a wooden stick or small paddle for stirring together the mixture.</p><p>The bowl containing the sponge was placed in a warm place to rise.

The oven should be hot enough to allow them to rise quickly. Put something underneath the pans in the oven to prevent bottom of cakes from burning. These may be set about 8 o'clock in the morning if cakes are wished for lunch at noon. These are not cheap, as this quantity makes only 12 cakes, but they are light as puffballs. The Professor's wife served them when she gave a "Kaffee Klatch." She doubled the recipe, baked the cakes in the morning, and placed them in the oven to heat through before serving. The cakes should be broken apart, not cut. The cakes made from this recipe are particularly fine.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BUCKS COUNTY <ingredient>CINNAMON</ingredient> "KUCHEN"</purpose> Explicit directions for the making of these excellent raised cakes was given Mary by an old, experienced Pennsylvania German cook. They were prepared from the following recipe: Early in the morning 1 pint of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> was scalded. When lukewarm, add 3 1/2 cups of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and 1 cake of Fleischman's compressed <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> (which had been dissolved in 1 tablespoonful of <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient>). Beat the mixture well. Cover and stand in a warm place to rise. When well risen, which should be in about 2 hours, add the following mixture, composed of 3/4 cup of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and 1/2 cup of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> creamed together; 1/2 teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> 1 <ingredient>egg</ingredient> was beaten into the mixture, and about 2 cups of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> were added, enough to make a dough as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. Dough should not be as stiff as for <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Let stand about 1 hour. When well risen and light, divide into four portions. Roll out each piece of dough to thickness of one inch. Place cakes in medium-sized pie tins and allow them to stand about one hour. When well risen, doubled in bulk, make half dozen deep impressions on top of each cake with the forefinger. Brush top of each cake with 1/2 tablespoonful of melted <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Sprinkle over 2 tablespoonfuls of soft A <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and sift over a little<pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=244"/> <ingredient>pulverized cinnamon,</ingredient> if liked, just before placing cakes in oven. Bake cakes from 20 to 25 minutes in a moderately hot oven. From this dough may be made four cakes.</p><p>Excellent <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> may also be made from this same dough, by simply moulding it into small <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> and place in a pan some distance apart. Let rise and brush tops of <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> with a mixture composed of a part of an <ingredient>egg yolk,</ingredient> a tablespoonful of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and 1/2 teaspoonful <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> This causes the <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> to have a rich, brown color when baked.</p><p>The sponge from which these cakes or <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> were made was mixed and set to rise at 6 o'clock in the morning, and the baking was finished at 11 o'clock. Sponge should be set to rise in a warm room. If these directions are carefully followed the housewife will invariably have good results. Always use <ingredient>hard</ingredient> Spring <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>biscuits,</ingredient> raised with <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> and <ingredient>Winter wheat,</ingredient> which costs less, will answer for making cake and pastry.

Always strain <ingredient>fat</ingredient> carefully after frying croquettes, fritters, etc. Should the frying <ingredient>fat</ingredient> become dark add to the can of <ingredient>soap fat</ingredient> the economical housewife is saving. Return the clear-strained <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to the cook pot, cover carefully, stand aside in a cool place, and the strained <ingredient>fat</ingredient> may be used times without number for frying. The housewife will find it very little trouble to fry fritters, croquettes, etc., in deep <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is always strained immediately after using, and returned to the cook pot, kept especially for this purpose. Stand on the hot range when required and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will heat in a few minutes, and if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is the right temperature, food cooked in it should not be at all greasy. When the housewife is planning to fry fritters or croquettes she should, if possible, crumb the articles to be fried several hours before frying, and stand aside to become perfectly cold. When the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> for frying is so hot a blue smoke arises, drop in the fritters or croquettes, one at a time, in order not to chill the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or plunge a frying basket, containing only a couple of fritters at a time, in the hot <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> as too many placed in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> at one time lowers the temperature too quickly and causes the fritters to be greasy and soggy. To test the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> before dropping in the fritters, if a small piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is dropped in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> and browns in about one minute the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is the right tem-perature for frying fritters, and fritters fried at the correct tem-perature should be a rich brown and at all greasy.

Dumplings prepared from this recipe may be dropped on stewed <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> and <ingredient>broth</ingredient> and cooked or steamed make an excellent pot-pie. Should there be more dough mixed than required for dumpings, place a panful in the oven and bake as <ingredient>biscuits.</ingredient> More <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> is required when dough is steamed or boiled than when baked in the oven.</p>

Never allow a roast or piece of stewing meat to lie for a second in water. Aunt Sarah did not think that wiping meat with a damp cloth was all that was necessary (although many wise and good cooks to the contrary). Place meat and soup bones in a stock pot, pour over the requisite amount of soft, cold water to extract the juice and nutritive quality of the meat; allow it to come to a<pb n="235" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=279"/> boil, then stand back on the range, where it will just simmer for 3 or 4 hour, Then add a sliced onion, several sprigs of parsley, small pieces of chopped celery tops, well-scraped roots of celery, and allow to simmer three-quarters of an hour longer. Season well with salt and pepper, 1 level teaspoonful of salt will season 1 quart of soup. Strain through a fine sieve, stand aside, and when cool remove from top the solid cake of fat which had formed and use for frying after it has been clarified. It is surprising to know the variety of soups made possible by the addition of a small quantity of vegetables or cereals to stock. A couple tablespoonfuls of rice or barley added to well-seasoned stock and you have rice or barley soup. A small quantity of stewed, sweet corn or noodles, frequently "left-overs," finely diced or grated carrots, the half can of tomatoes, a "left-over" from dinner, add a table-spoonful of butter, a seasoning of salt and pepper, thicken to a creamy consistency with a little cornstarch, add to cup of soup stock, serve with croutons of bread or crackers, and you have an appetizing addition to dinner or lunch.</p><p>The possibilities for utilizing left-overs are almost endless. The economically-inclined housewife will be surprised to find how easily she may add to the stock pot by adding left-over undesirable pieces of meat and small quantities of vegetables. One or two spoonfuls of cold left-over oatmeal may also be added to soup with advantage, occasionally. Always remove the cake of fat which forms on top of soup as soon as cooled, as soup will turn sour more quickly if it is allowed to remain. If soup stock be kept several days in summer lime, heat it each day to prevent souring. Pieces of celery onion, parsley, beans and peas may all be added to soup to make it more palatable. Also fine noodles. The yolk of a hard-boiled egg dropped into the soup kettle and heated through, allowing one for each plate of soup served, is a quick and appetizing addition to a soup of plain broth or consomme.</p>

<section><hd rend="bold" align="center">MEAT</hd><p>Every young housewife should be taught that simmering is more effective than violent boiling, which converts water into useless steam. Even a tough, undesirable piece of "chuck" or "pot roast" may be made more tender and palatable by long-continued simmering than it would be if put in rapidly boiling water and kept boiling at that rate. Meat may be made more tender also by being marinated; that is, allowing the meat to stand for some time in a mixture of olive oil and vinegar before cooking it. In stewing most meats a good plan is to put a large tablespoonful of finely-minced beef suet in the stew-pan; when fried out, add a little butter, and when sizzling hot add the meat, turn and sear on both sides to retain the juice in the meat, then add a little hot water and let come to a boil; then stand where the meat will just simmer but not stop cooking for several hours. The meat then should be found quite tender. Cheaper cuts of meat, especially, require long, slow cooking or simmering to make them tender, but are equally as nutritious as high-priced meats if properly prepared.</p><p>To quote from 
<emph rend="italic">The Farmers' Bulletin:</emph> "The number of appetizing dishes which a good cook can make out of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> 'left over' is almost endless. Undoubtedly more time and skill are required in their preparation than in the simple cooking of the more expensive cuts. The real superiority of a good cook lies not so much in the preparation of expensive or fancy dishes as in the attractive preparation of inexpensive dishes, for every day. In the skillful combination of flavors. Some housewives seem to have<pb n="251" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=295"/> a prejudice against economizing. If the comfort of the family does not suffer and the meals are kept as varied and appetizing as when they cost more, with little reason for complaint, surely it is not beneath the dignity of any family to avoid useless expenditure, no matter how generous its income. And the intelligent housekeeper should take pride in setting a good table."</p><p>This is such an excellen article, and so ably written and true, that I feel it would be to the advantage of every young housewife to read and profit by it.</p>

For ordinary <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> 2 level table spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> or 1 1/2 tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>cornstarch,</ingredient> or arrow root, is sufficient to thicken a cup of liquid. This is true excepting in recipes where the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is browned. In this case, about 1/2 tablespoonful more should be allowed, for <ingredient>browned flour</ingredient> does not thicken so well as unbrowned. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> used may be <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or the <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> from the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the allowance being 2 tablespoonfuls to a cup of liquid. The easiest way to mix the ingredients is to heat the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> add the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and cook until the mixture ceases to bubble, and then to add the liquid. This is a quick method and by using it there is little danger of getting a lumpy <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient> Many persons, however, think it is not a wholesome method, and prefer the old-fashioned one of thickening the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> by means of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> mixed with a little <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> (Aunt Sarah was one who thought thus.) The latter method is not "practicable for brown <ingredient>gravies,</ingredient>" to quote the 
<emph rend="italic">Farmers' Bulletion</emph>.</p><p>The 
<emph rend="italic">Farmers' Bulletin</emph> further adds:</p><p>"Considering the large amount of discussion about the digestibility of fried food and of <ingredient>gravies</ingredient> made by heating <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> a few words on the subject at this point may not be out of order. It is difficult to see how heating the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> before adding the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> can be unwholesome, unless the cook is unskillful enough to heat the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> so high that it begins to scorch. Overheated <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> as has already been pointed out, contains an acrid, irritating substance called 'Acrolein,' which may readily be considered to be unwholesome.

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>BUTTER,</ingredient> <ingredient>CHEESE</ingredient> AND <ingredient>SUET</ingredient>-A SUBSTITUTE FOR <ingredient>BUTTER</ingredient></purpose> This formula for preparing a good, sweet, wholesome substitute for <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to be used for baking and frying was given Aunt Sarah by a thrifty German hausfrau, who prepared and used it in her large family many years. Aunt Sarah always kept a supply on hand. It was made as follows:</p><p><list><item>10 pounds of fine solid <ingredient>kidney suet.</ingredient></item><item>10 pounds of c<ingredient>lean pork fat.</ingredient></item><item>10 pounds of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></item></list> The <ingredient>suet</ingredient> cut in small pieces was put in a large boiler of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> boiled until all was melted, and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> extracted from the <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> It was then all poured through a fine sieve into 3 vessel containing <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> (the larger the quantity of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> the finer the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> will be). Stand aside to become cold and solid. The boiling process prevents the peculiar taste which 
<emph rend="italic">fried</emph> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet</ingredient> usually possess. Treat the <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> in a similar manner. Allow the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> to stand until the following morning, when remove the solid <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the boiler of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> wipe off all moisture and add both <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet fat</ingredient> to the melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> which had been prepared in the following manner: The <ingredient>butter</ingredient> was melted in a porcelain lined boiler and allowed to cook until all <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and other foreign substance had settled and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> had the appearance of clear <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> At this point the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be watched carefully, as when settled it might quickly boil over, when you would be liable to lose your <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> besides suffering serious consequences. Now the liquid <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> are all put together into a large boiler and allowed to melt together on the back part of the range. This will probably be done in the morning. After the noon meal is finished move the boiler containing <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to front part of range; let come to a boil, skimming it occasionally as it boils up. It needs close watching now, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> being liable to cook over the top of boiler, when the "<ingredient>fat</ingredient>" would surely be "in the fire." Carefully pour into stone crock, and it may be kept for months in a cool place.<pb n="289" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=333"/> The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which has been first poured off the top, if it has been carefully skimmed, will keep longest. The last taken from the boiler should be put in a stone crock to use first. This may be prepared in lesser quantities, or a smaller quantity of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> might be used to mix with the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet.</ingredient> Although the preparation is to be preferred composed of equal quantities of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> adding <ingredient>milk</ingredient> to the first <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is boiled is quite an improvement. After filling the crocks with the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> take the boiled-out <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>hard</ingredient> scraps and settlings of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> remaining and go through the same process and you will have a small jar of cooking <ingredient>fat</ingredient> for immediate use. A little trouble to do this, I admit, but one is well paid by having good, sweet, inexpensive cooking <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> I should advise a young housekeeper to experiment with one pound each of clarified <ingredient>suet</ingredient> and <ingredient>pork fat</ingredient> after it is rendered, and one pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> before attempting the preparation of a larger quantity.</p>

<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>BUTTER</ingredient>-AS IT WAS MADE AT THE FARM, BY "AUNT SARAH"</purpose> Aunt Sarah strained fresh, <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> into small, brown earthenware crocks kept for this purpose, scrupulously clean.

Aunt Sarah churned twice a week; <ingredient>sour cream</ingredient> should not be kept a longer time than one week. The churn was scalded with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> then rinsed with <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> this prevented the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> adhering to the churn. The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be at a temperature of 60 degrees when put in the churn, but this would be almost too cold in Winter.

Take one-third of this tried-out <ingredient>suet</ingredient> to two-thirds <ingredient>lard</ingredient> when frying croquettes, <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> cruellers or fritters. <ingredient>Suet</ingredient> contains food value equal to that of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and food fried in this <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> combined with <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> is more wholesome than if fried in <ingredient>lard</ingredient> alone-if any food fried in <ingredient>fat</ingredient> ever is wholesome. And <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is more economical than <ingredient>lard</ingredient> if rendered at home. Mary was taught by her Aunt to save all the trimmings from <ingredient>steaks,</ingredient> <ingredient>fat</ingredient> left over from roasts, boiled <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>sausage,</ingredient> <ingredient>bacon fat,</ingredient> etc. When different fats have been tried out, to clarify them, add to every pound and a half of combined <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> a half cup of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and a pinch of <ingredient>baking soda.</ingredient> Boil until wafer evaporates and <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is clear. Strain into a bowl and keep in a cool place. Clean, sweet <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> are preferred by most cooks to <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for many purposes.

She used the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass in the proportion of 10 quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pint of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass, although in liquid form, is usually sold<pb n="296" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=340"/> by the pound, and 1 1/2 pounds equals one pint. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should always be boiled and allowed to cool before combining with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass.</p><p>She was particular to use none but perfectly clean, fresh <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> She placed the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> narrow end down, in an earthenware crock which had been well scalded and cooled.

Place clean, fresh <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> carefully into the crock containing the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> with a long-handled spoon to avoid cracking the shell. Stand the crock containing <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in a cool place, cover with a cloth tied over top of crock, avoiding frequent change of temperature; they should keep one year. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass solution may become cloudy, and resemble a soft-<ingredient>soap</ingredient> mixture, but this is a natural condition and does not affect the <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient></p><p>April is considered the best month for packing <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Infertile <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are to be preferred to others. Carefully remove the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> from the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass mixture with a long-handled spoon when wanted to use, as the shells are sometimes not quite as <ingredient>hard</ingredient> as when placed in the crock. The <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> may he used for cooking, baking, in fact, for any purpose except soft-boiled, but should you wish to boil them, a tiny puncture should be made in the shell of these <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> before boiling.</p><p>Ten quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> glass will cover about 12 or 13 dozen <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient></p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">CAKES-CAKE-MAKING</purpose> Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> together several times before adding to cake batter. Aunt Sarah usually sifted <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> together four times for cakes. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should always be sifted before using. <ingredient>Baking powder</ingredient> should be sifted through the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> dry. Salaratus (or <ingredient>baking soda</ingredient>) should, usually, be dissolved before using in a teaspoonful of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> unless stated otherwise. <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> should be sifted with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should be added gradually and batter stirred as little as possible afterwards, unless directions are given to<pb n="326" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=370"/> the contrary. Much beating after <ingredient>flour</ingredient> has been added is apt to make cake tough. Cake will be lighter if baked slowly at first. After it has raised increase heat slowly so it will brown nicely on top. The batter, if heated slowly, will rise evenly. This does not mean a cool oven. To prevent cakes sticking to pans, <ingredient>grease</ingredient> pans well with <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> and sift a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> lightly over pan. Use <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> with <ingredient>sweet milk.</ingredient> <ingredient>Saleratus</ingredient> is always used with <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> Use 1 teaspoonful of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> to 1 pint of <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> combined may be used with <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> instead of <ingredient>baking powder.</ingredient> One heaping teaspoonful of Royal <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> is equivalent to 1 teaspoonful of <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and 1/2 teaspoonful of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> combined. Either <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> or a combination of <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> may be used in a cake in which <ingredient>sweet milk</ingredient> is used. Usually take 1 1/2 to 2 scant teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> to two cups of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> <ingredient>Saleratus</ingredient> should be used alone with <ingredient>sour milk.</ingredient> Put baking <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> in a stew-pan over fire and allow it to just come to boil; cool before using it. It will not sour as quickly in warm weather, and the cake baked from it will have a better flavor. The cup used in measuring ingredients for cakes holds exactly one-half pint. All cakes are improved by the addition of a pinch of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> When <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is used instead of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> beat to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> well. In mixing cakes, beat <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> together until light and creamy, then add the beaten <ingredient>yolks of eggs,</ingredient> unless stated otherwise as for angel cake, etc., then the flavoring, then mix in the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and liquid alternately. The <ingredient>baking powder,</ingredient> <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should have been sifted together three or four times before being added. Lastly, fold in lightly the stiffly beaten <ingredient>whites of eggs.</ingredient> <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> well dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be added last, if used. Cool the oven if too hot for baking cakes by placing a pan containing <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in the top rack of oven. Sponge cake particularly is improved by doing this, as it makes the cake moist. Stir sponge cake as little as possible after adding <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> as too much stirring then will make cake tough. Sift <ingredient>flour</ingredient> several times before using for sponge cake, as this causes the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to become lighter. Layer cake, and most small cakes, require a quick oven. The oven door should not be opened for 12 minutes after cake has been placed in oven. Rich cakes, loaf cakes must bake long and slowly. The richer the cake, the slower the heat required in baking.<pb n="327" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=371"/> To test the oven, if the hand can <ingredient>bear</ingredient> the heat of the oven 20 or 25 seconds, the oven then is the right temperature. After placing a loaf cake in oven do not open the oven door for 20 minutes. If oven be not hot enough, the cake will rise, then fall and be heavy. Angel cake, sunshine cake and sponge cake require a moderate oven.</p><p><ingredient>Raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>dried currants</ingredient> should be washed and dried before using in cake. All <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before being added to cake. <ingredient>Citron</ingredient> may be quickly and easily prepared by cutting on a slaw cutter or it may be grated before being added to cake. When a recipe calls for <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> it means two tablespoonfuls. A tablespoonful of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> melted, means the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be measured first, then melted. Aunt Sarah frequently used a mixture of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> in her cakes for economy's sake, and a lesser quantity may be used, as the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> quality of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is greater than that of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> When substituting <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> she always beat the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> before using it and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it well. If <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> and <ingredient>currants</ingredient> are placed in oven of range a few minutes to become warmed before being added to cake, then rolled in <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> they will not sink to bottom of cake when baked.</p>

If <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> pies, moisten the edge of the lower crust, cover with top crust, which has been rolled quite thin. A knife scraped across the top crust several times before placing over pie causes the crust to have a rough, flaky, rich-looking surface when baked.

Roll out lightly the size of a <ingredient>tea</ingredient> plate. Take 1/3 of the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> remaining, put small <ingredient>dabs</ingredient> at different places on the dough (do not spread the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> over), then sprinkle over 1/3 of the remaining half cup of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and roll the dough into a long, narrow roll, folding the opposite ends in the centre of the roll. Roll out lightly (one way), then add <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and flou; roll and repeat the process until <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> have all been used. The pastry may be set aside in a cold place a short time before using. If particularly fine pastry is required, the dough might be rolled out once more, using small <ingredient>dabs of butter</ingredient> instead of <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> same quantity as was used of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for one layer, then dredged thickly with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and rolled over and over, and then ends folded together, when it should be ready to use. When wanted to line pie-tins, cut pieces off one end of the roll of dough and roll out lightly. The layers should show plainly when cut, and the pastry should puff nicely in baking, and be very rich, crisp and flaky. When preparing crusts for custards, lemon meringues and pies having only one crust, cut narrow strips of pastry about half an inch wide, place around the upper edge or rim of crust and press the lower edge of the strip against the crust; make small cuts with a knife about 1/3 inch apart, all around the edge of this extra crust, to cause it to look flaky when baked. This makes a rich pie crust.</p><p>A very good crust may be made by taking the same proportions as used for superior pastry, placing 1 1/2 to 2 cups <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the bake board, add <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> cut 1/2 cup <ingredient>lard</ingredient> through the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> moistening with <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Roll out crust and line pie-tins or small patty pans for tarts. This pastry is not quite as fine and smooth as the other, but requires less time and trouble to make.</p><p>The Professor's wife taught Mary to make this pastry, but Mary never could learn from her the knack of making a dainty, crimped, rolled-over edge to her pies, which she made easily with a deft twist of her thumb and fore-finger.</p>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BUCKS COUNTY <ingredient>APPLE BUTTER</ingredient></purpose> A genuine old-fashioned recipe for <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> as "Aunt Sarah" made it at the farm. A large kettle holding about five gallons was filled with sweet <ingredient>cider.</ingredient> This eider was boiled down to half the quantity. The <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> was cooked over a wood fire, out of doors. The <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was usually boiled down the day before making the <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> as the whole process was quite a lengthy one. Fill the kettle holding the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> with <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> which should have been pared and cored the night before at what country folks call an "<ingredient>apple</ingredient> bee," the neighbors assisting to expedite the work. The <ingredient>apples</ingredient> should be put on to cook as early in the morning as possible and cooked slowly over not too hot a fire, being stirred constantly with a long-handled "stirrer" with small perforated piece of wood on one end. There is great danger of the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> burning if not carefully watched and constantly stirred. An extra pot of boiling <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was kept near, to add to the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> as the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> boiled away. If cooked slowly, a whole day or longer will be consumed in cooking. When the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> had almost finished cooking, about the last hour, sweeten to taste with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> (<ingredient>brown sugar</ingredient> was frequently used). <ingredient>Spices</ingredient> destroy the true <ingredient>apple</ingredient> flavor, although Aunt Sarah used <ingredient>sassafras root,</ingredient> dug from the near-by woods, for flavoring her <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> and it was unexcelled. The <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> when cooked sufficiently, should be a dark rich color, and thick like <ingredient>marmalade,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>cider</ingredient> should not separate from it when a small quantity is tested on a saucer. An old recipe at the farm called for 32 gallons of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> to 8 buckets of <ingredient>cider apples,</ingredient> and to 40 gallons of <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> 50 pounds of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> were used. Pour the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> in small crocks used forthis purpose. Cover the top of crocks with <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> place in dry, cool store-room, and the <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> will keep several years. In olden times sweet <ingredient>apples</ingredient> were used for <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> boiled in sweet <ingredient>cider,</ingredient> then no <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> was necessary. Small brown, earthen pots were used to keep this <ingredient>apple butter</ingredient> in, it being only necessary to tie <ingredient>paper</ingredient> over the top. Dozens of these pots, filled with <ingredient>apple butter,</ingredient> might have been seen in Aunt Sarah's store-room at the farm at one time.</p>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">CANNED TOMATOES</purpose> When canning <ingredient>red tomatoes</ingredient> select those which ripen early<pb n="405" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=449"/> in the season, as those which ripen later are usually not as sweet.

Fill perfectly clean sterilized jars with the hot <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> fill quickly before they cool. Place rubber and top on jar, and when jars have become perfectly cold (although they may, apparently, have been perfectly air-tight), the tops should be given another turn before standing away for the Winter; failing to do this has frequently been the cause of inexperienced housewives' ill success when canning <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> Also run the edge of a knife blade carefully around the top of the jar, pressing down the outer edge and causing it to fit more closely. Aunt Sarah seldom lost a jar of canned <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> and they were as fine flavored as if freshly picked from the vines. She was very particular about using only new tops and rubbers for her jars when canning <ingredient>tomatoes.</ingredient> If the wise housewife takes these precautions, her canned <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> should keep indefinitely. Aunt Sarch allowed her jars of <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> to stand until the day following that on which the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> were canned, to be positively sure they were cold, before giving the tops a final turn.

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><ingredient>VINEGAR</ingredient> MADE FROM <ingredient>STRAWBERRIES</ingredient></purpose> "Aunt Sarah" Landis possessed the very finest flavored <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> for cooking purposes, and this is the way it was made. She having a very plentiful crop of fine <ingredient>strawberries</ingredient> one season, put 6 quarts of very ripe, mashed <ingredient>strawberries</ingredient> in a five-gallon crock, filled the crock with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> covered the top with cheese-cloth and allowed it to stand in a warm place about one week, when it was strained, poured into jugs and placed in the cellar, where it remained six months, perhaps longer, when it became very sharp and sour, and had very much the appearance of <ingredient>white wine</ingredient> with a particularly fine flavor. This was not used as a beverage, but as a substitute for <ingredient>cider</ingredient> in cooking.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">BOILED <ingredient>CIDER</ingredient> FOR MINCE PIES</purpose> In Autumn, when <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was cheap and plentiful on the farm, 3 quarts of <ingredient>cider</ingredient> was boiled down to one, or, in this proportion, for use in mince <ingredient>meat</ingredient> during the Winter. A quantity prepared in this manner, poured while hot in air-tight jars, will keep indefinitely.</p>

<formula class="household"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">RECIPE FOR MAKING <ingredient>HARD SOAP</ingredient> WITHOUT BOILING</purpose> To make <ingredient>hard soap</ingredient> without boiling, empty a can of "Lewis Perfumed Lye" (or any other good, reliable brand of lye) into a stone jar with 1 tablespoonful powdered borax. Add 2 1/2 pints of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to the lye. Stir until dissolved. Be very careful not to allow any of the lye to touch hands or face. Wear old gloves when emptying can and stirring lye. Stand the dissolved lye in a cool place. The tin cans containing the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to be used for <ingredient>soap</ingredient> (which have accumulated, been tried out, strained, and put in empty tin cans at different times) should be placed in the oven of range for a few minutes. When warm they may be turned out readily into a large stew-pan. Put over fire, and when all has dissolved and melted, strain through cheese-cloth bag into an agate dish pan. When weighed you should have 5 1/2 pounds of clear <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> A recipe telling exact quantity of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> and lye usually comes with can of lye. When temperature of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is 120 degrees by your thermometer (luke-warm), the lye should have been allowed to stand about 1 hour from the time it was dissolved. It should then be the right temperature to mix with strained, luke-warm <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>grease</ingredient> not over 80 degrees by thermometer.<pb n="420" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=matf&#38;PageNum=464"/> Now slowly pour the dissolved lye over the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> (a half cup of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> added improves <ingredient>soap</ingredient>), stir together until lye and <ingredient>grease</ingredient> are thoroughly incorporated, and the mixture drops from the stirrer like <ingredient>honey.</ingredient> The <ingredient>soap</ingredient> may be scented by adding a few drops of <ingredient>oil of cloves,</ingredient> if liked. Stir the mixture with a small wooden paddle or stick. Stir slowly from 5 to 10 minutes, not longer, or the lye and <ingredient>fat</ingredient> may separate. Pour all into a large agate dish pan lined with a piece of clean muslin. Throw an old piece of carpet over the top and stand near the range until evening, when, if made early in the morning, a sold cake of <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> weighing 8 1/2 pounds, may be turned out on a bake-board (previously covered with brown <ingredient>paper</ingredient>) and cut into 20 pieces of good <ingredient>hard soap.</ingredient> Lay the pieces of <ingredient>soap</ingredient> in a basket, cover to protect from dust, and stand in a warm room to dry throughly before using. <ingredient>Soap</ingredient> made according to these directions should be solid and almost as <ingredient>white</ingredient> as ivory if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> used has not been scorched.</p><p>This <ingredient>soap</ingredient> is excellent for scrubbing and laundry purposes. The greater length of time the <ingredient>soap</ingredient> is kept, the better it will become. The <ingredient>grease</ingredient> used may be clarified by adding <ingredient>water</ingredient> and cooking a short time. Stand away and wheen cool remove <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from top, wiping off any moisture that may appear. <ingredient>Soap</ingredient>-making is a 
<emph rend="italic">small economy</emph>. Of course, the young housewife will not use for <ingredient>soap</ingredient> 
<emph rend="italic">any <ingredient>fat</ingredient></emph> which could be utilized for frying, etc., but she will be surprised to find, when she once gets the saving habit, how quickly she will have the quantity of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> needed for a dollar's worth of <ingredient>soap</ingredient> by the small outlay of the price of a can of lye, not counting her work. The young, inexperienced housewife should be careful not to use too small a stew-pan in which to heat the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and should not, under any circumstance, leave the kitchen while the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is on the range, as grave results might follow carelesness in this respect.</p>
