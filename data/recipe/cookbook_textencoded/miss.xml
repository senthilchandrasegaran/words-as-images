<hd align="center" size="larger">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>When the author wrote the Appledore Cook Book, nine years ago, she had seen so many failures and so much consequent mortification and dissatisfaction as to determine her to give those minute directions which were so often wanting in cook-books, and without which success in preparing dishes was for many a person unattainable. It seemed then unwise to leave much to the cook's judgment; and experience in lecturing and in teaching in her school since that time has satisfied the author that what was given in her first literary work was what was needed. In this book an endeavor has been made to again supply what is desired: to have the directions and descriptions clear, complete and concise. Especially has this been the case in the chapter on Marketing. Much more of interest might have been written, but the hope which led to brevity was that the few pages devoted to remarks on that important household duty, and which contain about all that the average cook or housekeeper cares and needs to know, will be carefully read. It is believed that there is much in them of considerable value to those whose knowledge of meats, fish and vegetables is not extensive; much that would help to an intelligent selection of the best provisions.</p>
<p>Of the hundredes of recipes in the volume only a few were not prepared especially for it, and nearly all of these were taken by the author from her other books. Many in the chapters on Preserving and Pickling were contributed by Mrs. E. C.
 
<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=10"/>
Daniell of Dedham, Mass., whose understanding of the lines of cookery mentioned is thorough. While each subject has received the attention it seemed to deserve, Soups, Salads, Entr&#233;es and Dessert have been treated at unusual length, because with a good acquaintance with the first three, one can set a table more healthfully, economically and elegantly than with meats or fish served in the common ways; and the light desserts could well take the place of the pies and heavy puddings of which many people are so fond. Many ladies will not undertake the making of a dish that requires hours for cooking, and often for the poor reason only that they do not so read a recipe as to see that the work will not be hard. If they would but forget cake and pastry long enough to learn something of food that is more satisfying!</p>
<p>After much consideration it was decided to be right to call particular attention in different parts of the book to certain manufactured articles. Lest her motive should be misconstrued, or unfair criticisms be made, the author would state that there is not a word of praise which is not merited, and that every line of commendation appears utterly without the solicitation, suggestion or <emph rend="italic">knowledge</emph> of anybody likely to receive pecuniary benefit therefrom.</p>

NEW COOK BOOK.</hd>
<chapter class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" size="larger">MARKETING.</hd>
<p>Upon the amount of practical knowledge of marketing that the housekeeper has, the comfort and expense of the family are in a great measure dependent; therefore, every head of a household should acquire as much of this knowledge as is practicable, and the best way is to go into the market. Then such information as is gained by reading becomes of real value. Many think the market not a pleasant or proper place for ladies. The idea is erroneous. My experience has been that there are as many gentlemen among marketmen as are to be found engaged in any other business. One should have a regular place at which to trade, as time is saved and disappointment obviated. If not a judge of meat, it is advisable, when purchasing, to tell the dealer so, and rely upon him to do well by you. He will probably give you a nicer piece than you could have chosen. If a housekeeper makes a practice of going to the market herself, she is able to supply her table with a better variety than she is by ordering at the door or by note, for she sees many good and fresh articles that would not have been thought of at home. In a book like this it is possible to treat at length only of such things as meat, fish and vegetables, which always form a large item of expense.</p>
<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" size="larger">BEEF.</hd>
<p>Beef is one of the most nutritious, and, in the end, the most economical, kinds of meat, for there is not a scrap of it which a good housekeeper will not utilize for food.</p>
 
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=14"/>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">As to Choosing It.</hd>
<p>Good steer or heifer beef has a fine grain, a yellowish-white fat, and is firm. When first cut it will be of a dark red color, which changes to a bright red after a few minutes' exposure to the air. It will also have a juicy appearance; the suet will be dry, crumble easily and be nearly free from fibre. The flesh and fat of the ox and cow will be darker, and will appear dry and rather coarse. The quantity of meat should be large for the size of the bones. Quarters of beef should be kept as long as possible before cutting. The time depends upon climate and conveniences, but in the North should be two or three weeks. A side of beef is first divided into two parts called the fore and hind quarters. These are then cut into variously-shaped and sized pieces. Different localities have different names for some of these cuts. The diagrams represent the pieces as they are sold in the Boston market, and the tables give the New York and Philadelphia names for the same pieces. In these latter two cities, when the side of beef is divided into halves, they cut farther back on the hind quarter than they do in Boston, taking in all the ribs--thirteen and sometimes fourteen. This gives one more rib roast. They do not have what in Boston is called the tip of the sirloin.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Hind Quarter.</hd>
<p>In Philadelphia they cut meat more as is done in Boston than they do in New York. The following diagram shows a hind quarter as it appears in Boston. In the other two cities the parts I and I3f are included in the <emph rend="italic">fore</emph> quarter. The dotted lines show wherein the New York cutting differs from the Boston:</p>

<p>The hind quarter consists of the loin, rump, round, tenderloin or fillet of beef, leg and flank. The loin is usually cut into roasts and steaks; the roasts are called sirloin roasts and the steaks sirloin or porter-house steaks. In the loin is found the tenderloin; and a small piece of it (about two and a half pounds in a large animal) runs back into the rump. In Boston this is often sold under the name of the short fillet, but the New York and Philadelphia marketmen do not cut it. Plate No. 2 shows the fillet.</p>
<illustration><caption>Plate NO. 2. SHORT FILLET.</caption><description>An illustration of a short fillet.</description></illustration>
<p>Next the loin comes the the rump, from which are cut steaks, roasts and pieces for stewing, braising, a la mode and soups. Next the rump comes the round, from which are cut steaks, pieces for a la mode, stewing, braising and soups. The flank is cut from the loin, and used for corning, stewing and as a roll of beef.</p>
<p>Plate No. 4 represents a loin as cut in Boston and Philadelphia, and it and No. 3 represent one as cut in New York, if the two parts be imagined joined at the point A. No. 4 also shows the inside of the loin, where the tenderloin lies.</p>
<p>The sirloin is cut in all sizes, from eight to twenty pounds, to suit the purchaser. The end next the ribs gives the smallest pieces, which are best for a small family. The tenderloin in this cut is not as large as in the first and second. In cutting sirloin steaks or roasts, dealers vary as to the amount of flank they leave on. There should be little,
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=19"/>
if any, as that is not a part for roasting or broiling. When it is all cut off the price of the sirloin is of course very much more than when a part is left on, but though the cost is increased eight or ten cents a pound, it is economy to pay this rather than take what you do not want.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Porter-House Steaks.</hd>
<p>Every part of the sirloin, and a part of the rump, is named porter-house steak in various localities. In New York the second cut of the sirloin is considered the choice one for these steaks. The rump steak, when cut with the tenderloin in it, is also called porter-house steak. The original porter-house steaks came from the small end of the loin.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sirloin Steaks.</hd>
<p>Sirloin steaks are cut from all parts of the loin, beginning with the small end and finishing with the rump. In New York the rump steaks are also known as sirloin. In some places they do not cut tenderloin with sirloin. One slice of sirloin from a good-sized animal will weigh about two and a half pounds. If the flank, bone and fat were removed, there would remain about a pound of clear, tender, juicy meat. There being, therefore, considerable waste to this steak, it
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 5. SIRLOIN ROAST--SECOND CUT.</caption><description>An illustration of a sirloin roast.</description></illustration>
will always be expensive as compared with one from a rump or round. But many persons care only for this kind, as it has a flavor peculiar to itself; and they will buy it regardless of economy. Plate No. 5 shows a second cut of the sirloin, with the shape of a sirloin or small porter-house
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=21"/>
steak. The only part that is really eatable as a steak is from the base to the point A, the remainder being flank.</p>

</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Rump Steak.</hd>
<p>What in Boston and Philadelphia is called rump steak is in New York named sirloin. There are three methods of cutting a rump steak; two of these give a very fine steak, the third almost the poorest kind. The first two are to cut across the grain of the meat, and thus obtain, when the beeve is a good one, really the best steaks in the animal.</p>
<p>Plates Nos. 6 and 7 represent these steaks. No. 6 is a long rump steak, very fine; and No. 7 a short rump, also excellent. In both of these there is a piece of tenderloin. In
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=22"/>
New York, No. 6 is sirloin without bone, and No. 7 sirloin. There is yet another slice of rump that is of a superior quality. It is cut from the back of the rump, and there is
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 8. RUMP STEAK CUT WITH THE GRAIN.</caption> <description>An illustration of a rump steak cut "with the grain."</description></illustration>
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 9. BACK OF THE RUMP.</caption> <description>An illustration of the back of the rump.</description></illustration>
no tenderloin in it. Plate No. 8 shows a rump steak cut with the grain of the meat; that is, cut lengthwise. It comes much cheaper than the others, but is so poor that it
 
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=23"/>
should never be bought. It will curl up when broiled, and will be tough and dry.</p>
<p>Some marketmen will not cut rump steak by the first two methods, because it spoils the rump for cutting into roasts, and 
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 11. ROUND OF BEEF.</caption><description>A picture of a round of beef.</description> </illustration>
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 10. AITCHBONE. </caption><description>A picture of the aitchbone.</description></illustration>
also leaves a great deal of bone and some tough meat on hand. The price per pound for a rump steak cut with the grain is ten cents less than for that cut across, and yet dealers do not
 
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=24"/>
find it profitable to sell steak cut the latter way. Plate No. 9 shows the back of the rump, which is used for steaks and to roast. The steaks are juicy and tender, but do not contain any tenderloin.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="indent1" rend="bold">Round Steaks.</hd>
<p>Plate No. 11 shows the round of beef with the aitch bone taken off; a, a, a, a, is the top of the round, b, b, b, b, the under part, where the aitchbone has been cut off, and c, c, c, c, the vein. Plate No. 10 is this aitchbone, which is first cut from the round, and then the steaks are taken off.</p>
<p>The best steak begins with the third slice. The top and under part of the round are often cut in one slice. The top is tender and the under part tough. When both are together the steak sells for fifteen or sixteen cents per pound; when separate, the top is twenty or more and the under part from ten to twelve. If it is all to be used as a steak, the better way is to buy the top alone; but if you wish to make a stew one day and have a steak another, it is cheaper to buy both parts together. Round steak is not, of course, as tender as tenderloin, sirloin or rump, but it has a far richer and higher flavor than any of the others. It should be cut thick, and be cooked rare over a quick fire. Steaks are cut from the vein in the round and from the shoulder in the fore quarter. They are of about the same quality as those from the round.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Tenderloin Steak.</hd>
<p>This is cut from the tenderloin, and costs from twenty-five cents to a dollar per pound. It is very soft and tender, but has hardly any flavor, and is not half as nutritious as one from a round or rump.</p>
<emph rend="bold">Quality and Cost.</emph>
<p>We will now consider the various kinds of steak, as to their cost and nutritive qualities. The prices given are not

<p>The tenderloin, rump and round steaks are all clear meat; therefore, there is no waste, and of course one will not buy as many pounds of these pieces to provide for a given number of persons as if one were purchasing a sirloin or porter-house steak, because with the latter-named the weight of bone and of the flank, if this be left on, must always be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>After the aitchbone and steaks have been taken from the round there remain nice pieces for stewing and braising; and still lower the meat and bones are good for soups and jellies. The price decreases as you go down to the shank, until for the shank itself you pay only from three to four cents per pound.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that plate No. 4 represents a loin of beef, showing the end which joined the ribs, also the kidney suet. No. 12 represents the same loin, showing the end which joined the rump. There are about thirty pounds in a sirloin that has been cut from a large beeve. This makes about three roasting pieces for a moderately large family. The piece next the rump has the largest tenderloin and is, therefore, by many considered the choicest. Steaks cut from it are now served in the principal hotels as porter-house.</p>

<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=28"/>
must remember that in New York and Philadelphia there are thirteen ribs, eight of which are prime. The first two chuck ribs make a very good roast or steak, being one of the most nutritious cuts in the animal, and the next three are good for stewing and braising. Many people roast them. The flavor is fine when they are cooked in this manner, but the meat is rather tough. A chuck rib contains part of the shoulder-blade, while the prime ribs do not. In New York and Philadelphia the ribs are cut much longer than in Boston; hence the price per pound is less there. But the cost to the purchaser is as great as in Boston, because he has to pay for a great deal of the rattle-ran or rack. It is always best to have the ribroasts cut short, and even pay a higher price for them, as there will then be no waste.</p>

The shoulder of mutton is used for stews, beef <emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode,</emph> roasts and steaks, and is also corned. The sticking piece, commonly called the back of the shoulder, but which is really the front, is used for stews, soups, pie meat and for corning.

<hd align="center" size="larger">MUTTON.</hd>
<p>Mutton is very nutritious and easily digested. The best quality will have clear, hard, white fat, and a good deal of it; the lean part will be juicy, firm and of a rather dark red color. When there is but little fat, and that is soft and yellow and the meat is coarse and stringy, you may be sure that the quality is poor. Mutton is much improved by being hung in a cool place for a week or more. At the North a leg will keep quite well for two or three weeks in winter, if hung in a cold, dry shed or cellar. Mutton, like beef, is first split through the back, and then the sides are divided, giving two fore and two hind quarters. Diagram No. 18 is of a whole carcass of mutton, and half of it is numbered to show the pieces into which the animal is cut for use.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Hind Quarter of Mutton</hd>
<p>This consists of the leg and loin, and is the choicest cut. It makes a fine roast for a large family, but for a moderate-sized or small one either the leg or loin alone is better. A hind quarter taken from a prime animal will weigh from twenty to thirty pounds.</p>
<illustration><caption>PLATE NO. 19.</caption> <description>An illustration of a leg of mutton.</description></illustration>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Leg Of Mutton.</hd>
<p>This joint is nearly always used for roasting and boiling. It has but little bone, as compared with the other parts of the animal, and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It is not common to find a good leg weighing under ten or twelve pounds. A leg is shown in plate No. 19.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Loin of Mutton.</hd>
<p>In a loin, as cut in Boston, there are seven ribs, which make a good roast for a small family. This cut is particularly nice in hot weather. It is not as large as a leg, and the 
 
<pb n="33" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=37"/>
meat is, besides, of a lighter quality and more delicate flavor. The cost when the flank is taken off will be about seven cents more a pound than if the loin be sold with it on; but, unless you wish to use the flank for a soup, stew or haricot, it is the better economy to buy a trimmed piece and pay the higher price. When the two loins are joined they are called a saddle. Plate No. 20 shows a saddle and two French chops.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fore Quarter of Mutton.</hd>
<p>In this is included the shoulder and breast. When the shoulder-blade is taken out the quarter makes a good roast for a large family. The shoulder is separated from the breast by runing a sharp knife between the two, starting at the curved dotted lines near the neck (shown in diagram No. 18), and cutting round to the end of the line. The shoulder is nice
 
<pb n="34" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=38"/>
for roasting or boiling. The breast can be used for a roast, for broths, braising, stewing or cotelettes. Rib chops are also cut from the breast, which is, by the way, the cheapest part of the mutton.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Chops and Cutlets.</hd>
<p>Chops are cut from the loin. They are called long when the flank is cut on them and short if without it. When part of the bone of the short chop is scraped clean it is called a French chop. The rolled chops sold by provision dealers are the long chops with the bone removed. One often sees them selling at a low price. They are then the poor parts of the mutton, like the flank, and will be found very expensive no matter how little is asked.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">

<p>When one has a large family it brings all kinds of meat considerably cheaper to buy large pieces untrimmed, as the trimmings can be used for soups, stews, etc.; but for a small family it is much better to purchase only the part you want for immediate use. Although mutton costs less per pound than beef, it is no cheaper in the end, because to be good it must be fat, and mutton fat, unlike beef fat, cannot be employed for cooking purposes, as it gives a strong flavor to any article with which it is used.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">LAMB.</hd>
<p>Lamb is cut and sold like mutton. Being much smaller, however, a hind or fore quarter is not too large for a good-sized family. Lamb will not keep as long as mutton, for, being juicy, it taints more readily. It is of a delicate flavor until nearly a year old, when it begins to taste like mutton and is not so tender. The bones of a young lamb will be red, and the fat hard and white. This meat is in season from May to September.</p>
</section>
<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" size="larger">VEAL.</hd>
<p>The calf being so much larger than the sheep, the fore and hind quarters are not cooked together, and for an ordinary family both are not purchased. The animal is, however, cut into the same parts as mutton. The loin, breast and shoulder are used for roasting. Chops are cut from the loin and neck, those from the neck being called rib chops or cotelettes. The neck itself is used for stews, pies, fricassees, etc. The leg is used for cutlets, fricandeaux, stews and roasts, and for braising. The fillet of veal is a solid piece cut from the leg--not like the tenderloin in beef, but used in much the same way. The lower part of the leg is called a knuckle, and is particularly nice for soups and sauces.</p>
<p>Good veal will have white, firm fat, and the lean part a pinkish tinge. When extremely white it indicates that the calf has been bled before being killed, which is a great cruelty to the animal, besides greatly impoverishing the meat. When veal is too young it will be soft and of a bluish tinge. The calf should not be killed until at least six weeks old. Veal is in the market all the year, but the season is really from April to September, when the price is low. The leg costs more than any other joint, because it is
 
<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=40"/>
almost wholly solid meat. The fillet costs from 20 to 25 cents; cutlets from the leg, 30 cents; chops from loin, 20 cents; loin for roast, 15 cents; breast, 10 to 12 cents. Veal is not nutritious nor easily digested. Many people cannot eat it in any form, but such a number of nice dishes can be made from it, and when in season the price is so low, that it will always be used for made dishes and soups.</p>
</section>
<section class1="marketing">
<hd size="larger" align="center">PORK.</hd>
<p>Pork, although not so much used in the fresh state as beef, mutton, lamb, etc., is extensively employed in the preparation of food. It is cut somewhat like mutton, but into more parts. Fresh young pork should be firm; the fat white, the lean a pale reddish color and the skin white and clear. When the fat is yellow and soft the pork is not of the best quality. After pork has been salted, if it is corn-fed, the fat will be of a delicate pinkish shade. When hogs weighing three and four hundred pounds are killed, the fat will not be very firm, particularly if they are not fed on corn. The amount of salt pork purchased at a time depends upon the mode of cooking in each family. If bought in small quantities it should be kept in a small jar or tub, half filled with brine, and a plate, smaller round than the tub, half filled with brine, and a plate, smaller round than the tub, should be placed on top of the meat to press it under the brine.</p>
<p>The parts into which the hog is cut are called leg, loin, rib piece, shoulder, neck, flank, brisket, head and feet. The legs and shoulders are usually salted and smoked. The loin of a large hog has about two or three inches of the fat cut with the rind. This is used for salting, and the loin fresh for roasting. When, however, the hog is small, the loin is simply scored and roasted. The ribs are treated the same as the loin, and when the rind and fat are cut off are called spare-ribs. This piece makes a sweet roast. Having much more
 
<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=41"/>
bone and less meat than the loin, it is not really any cheaper, although sold for less. The loin and ribs are both used for chops and steaks. The flank and brisket are corned. The head is sold while fresh for head-cheese, or is divided into two or four parts and corned, and is a favorite dish with many people. The feet are sometimes sold while fresh, but are more frequently first pickled. The fat taken from the inside of the hog and also all the trimmings are cooked slowly until dissolved. This, when strained and cooled, is termed lard. Many housekeepers buy the leaf or clear fat and try it out themselves. This is the best way, as one is then sure of a pure article.</p>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sausages.</hd>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Liver.</hd>
<p>Calves' liver is the best in the market, and always brings the highest price. In some markets they will not cut it. A single liver costs about fifty cents, and when properly cooked, several delicious dishes can be made from it.</p>
<p>Beef liver is much larger and darker than the calves', has a stronger flavor and is not so tender. It is sold in small or large pieces at a low price.</p>
<p>Pigs' liver is not nearly as good as the calves' or beeves', and comes very much cheaper.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Hearts.</hd>
<p>Both the calves' and beeves' hearts are used for roasting and braising. The calves' are rather small, but tenderer than the beeves'. The price of one is usually not more than fifteen cents. The heart is nutritious, but not easily digested.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Spring Chickens.</hd>
<p>These are generally used for broiling. They vary in size, weighing from half a pound to two and a half pounds. The small, plump ones, weighing about one and a half or two pounds, are the best. There is little fat on spring chickens.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Fowl.</hd>
<p>These may be anywhere from one to five or six years old. When over two years the meat is apt to be tough, dry and stringy. They should be fat, and the breast full and soft.

<p>It is more difficult to judge of the age and quality of a goose than of any other bird.

The domestic duck is in season nearly all the year, but the wild ones only through the fall and winter. The price varies with the

They are shipped from the West, packed in barrels, through the latter part of the winter and the early spring. Stall-fed pigeons are the tame ones cooped for a few weeks and well fed.

<p>To fully describe all the kinds of fish found in our markets would require too much space and is unneccessary, but a list of those of which there is usually a supply is given, that housekeepers may know what it is best to select in a certain season and have some idea of the prices.</p>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">To Select Fish.</hd>
<p>When fresh, the skin and scales will be bright, the eyes full and clear, the fins stiff and the body firm. If there is a bad odor, or, if the fish is soft and darker than is usual for that kind, and has dim, sunken eyes, it is not fit to use.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Codfish.</hd>
<p>This is good all the year, but best in the fall and winter.
 
<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=46"/>
When cooked, it breaks into large white flakes. It is not as nutritious as the darker kinds of fish, but is more easily digested. The price remains about the same through all seasons.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Haddock.</hd>
<p>This is a firmer and smaller-flaked fish than the cod, but varies little in flavor from it. The cod has a light stripe running down the sides; the haddock a dark one.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Cusk.</hd>
<p>This also belongs to the cod family, and is a firm, white fish. It is best in winter.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Pollock.</hd>
<p>This is used mostly for salting. It is much like the cod, only firmer grained and drier.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Halibut.</hd>
<p>This fine fish is always good. It varies in weight from two pounds to three hundred. The flesh is a pearly white in a perfectly fresh fish. That cut from one weighing from fifty to seventy-five pounds is the best, the flesh of any larger being coarse and dry. The small fish are called chicken halibut.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Flounders.</hd>
<p>These are thin, flat fish, often sold under the name of sole. Good at all times of the year.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Turbot.</hd>
<p>This is a flat fish, weighing from two to twenty pounds. The flesh is soft, white and delicate. Turbot is not common in our market.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Salmon.</hd>
<p>Salmon is in season from April to July, but is in its prime in June. It is often found in the market as early as January, when it brings a high price. Being very rich, a much smaller
 
<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=47"/>
quantity should be provided for a given number of people than of the lighter kinds of fish.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Shad.</hd>
<p>This is in season in the Eastern and Middle States from March to April, and in the Southern States from November to February. The flesh is sweet, but full of small bones. Shad is much prized for the roe.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Blue-fish.</hd>
<p>This is a rich, dark fish, weighing from two to eight pounds' and in season in June, July and August. It is particularly nice broiled and baked.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Black-fish, or Tautog.</hd>
<p>Good all the year, but best in the spring. It is not a large fish, weighing only from one to five pounds.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">White-fish, or Lake Shad.</hd>
<p>This delicious fish is found in the great lakes, and in the locality where caught it is always in season. At the South and in the East the market is supplied only in winter, when the price is about eighteen cents a pound. The average weight is between two and three pounds.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sea-Bass.</hd>
<p>This fish, weighing from half a pound to six or seven pounds, is very fine, and is in season nearly all the year. It is best in March, April and May.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Rock-Bass.</hd>
<p>The weight of rock-bass generally ranges from half a pound to thirty or forty pounds, but sometimes reaches eighty or a hundred. The small fish are the best. The very small ones (under one pound) are fried; the larger broiled, baked and boiled. The bass are in season all the year, but best in the fall.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
 
<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=48"/>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sword Fish.</hd>
<p>This is very large, with dark, firm flesh. It is nutritious, but not as delicate as other kinds of fish. It is cut and sold like halibut, and in season in July and August.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sturgeon.</hd>
<p>This fish, like the halibut and sword fish, is large. The flesh is of a light red color and the fat of a pale yellow. There is a rather strong flavor. A fish weighing under a hundred pounds will taste better than a larger one. The season is from April to September.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Weak-Fish.</hd>
<p>Weak-fish is found in the New York and Philadelphia markets from May to October. In the Eastern States it is not so well known. It is a delicate fish, and grows soft very quickly. It is good boiled or fried.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Small, or "Pan"-Fish.</hd>
<p>The small fish that are usually fried, have the general name of "pan"-fish. There is a great variety, each kind found in the market being nearly always local, as it does not pay to pack and ship them. A greater part have the heads and skin taken off before being sold.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Smelts.</hd>
<p>These are good at any time, but best in the winter, when they are both plenty and cheap.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Mullet.</hd>
<p>There are several varieties of this fish, which is much prized in some sections of the country. It is a small fish, weighing from a quarter of a pound to two or three pounds. It often has a slightly muddy flavor, owing to living a large part of the time in the mud of the rivers.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Mackerel.</hd>
<p>This fish is nutritious and cheap. It is in the market
 
<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=49"/>
through the spring and summer, and averages in weight between one and two pounds.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Spanish Mackerel.</hd>
<p>These are larger than the common mackerel, and have rows of yellow spots, instead of the dark lines on the sides. They are in season from June to October, and generally bring a high price.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Eels.</hd>
<p>These are sold skinned; are always in season, but best from April to November.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Lobsters.</hd>
<p>This shell-fish is in the market all the year, but is best in May and June. If the tail, when straightened, springs back into position, it indicates that the fish is fresh. The time of boiling live lobsters depends upon the size. If boiled too much they will be tough and dry. They are generally boiled by the fisherman. This is certainly the best plan, as these people know from practice, just how long to cook them. Besides, as the lobsters must be alive when put into the pot, they are ugly things to handle. The medium-sized are the tenderest and sweetest. A good one will be heavy for its size. In the parts of the country where fresh lobsters cannot be obtained, the canned will be found convenient for making salads, soups, stews, etc.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Hard-Shell Crabs.</hd>
<p>These are in the market all the year. They are sold alive and, also, like the lobster, boiled. Near the coast of the Southern and Middle States they are plenty and cheap, but in the interior and in the Eastern States they are quite expensive. They are not used as much as the lobster, because it is a great deal of trouble to take the meat from the shell.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=50"/>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Soft-Shell Crabs.</hd>
<p>As the crab grows, a new, soft shell forms, and the old, hard one is shed. Thus comes the soft-shelled crab. In about three days the shell begins to harden again. In Maryland there are ponds for raising these crabs, so that now the supply is surer than in former years. Crabs are a great luxury, and very expensive. In the Eastern States they are found only in warm weather. They must always be cooked while alive. Frying and broiling are the modes of preparing.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Shrimp.</hd>
<p>These are found on the Southern coasts; are much the shape of a lobster, but very small. They are used mostly for sauces to serve with fish. Their season is through the spring, summer and fall. There is a larger kind called big shrimp or prawns, sold boiled in the Southern markets. These are good for sauces or stews, and, in fact, can be used, in most cases, the same as lobster. But few shrimp are found in the Eastern or Western markets. The canned goods are, however, convenient and nice for sauces.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Terrapin.</hd>
<p>This shell-fish comes from the South, Baltimore being the great terrapin market. It belongs to the turtle family. It is always sold alive, and is a very expensive fish, the diamond backs costing from one to two dollars apiece. Three varieties are found in the market, the diamond backs, little bulls and red fenders. The first named are considered marketable when they measure six inches across the back. They are then about three years old. The little bulls, or male fish, hardly ever measure more than five inches across the back. They are cheaper than diamond backs, but not so well flavored. The red fenders grow larger than the others, and are much cheaper, but their meat is coarse and of an inferior flavor.
 
<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=51"/>
Terrapin are in the market all the year, but the best time to buy them is from November to February,</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Oysters.</hd>
<p>No other shell-fish is as highly prized as this. The oyster usually takes the name of the place where it is grown, because the quality and flavor depend very much upon the feeding grounds. The Blue-point, a small, round oyster from Long Island, is considered the finest in the market, and it costs about twice as much as the common oyster. Next comes the Wareham, thought by many quite equal to the Blue-point. It is a salt water oyster, and is, therefore, particularly good for serving raw. The Providence River oyster is large and well flavored, yet costs only about half as much as the Blue-point. The very large ones, however, sell at the same price. Oysters are found all along the coast from Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico. Those taken from the cool Northern waters are the best. The sooner this shell-fish is used after being opened, the better. In the months of May, June, July and August, the oyster becomes soft and milky. It is not then very healthful or well flavored. The common-sized oysters are good for all purposes of cooking except broiling and frying, when the large are preferable. The very large ones are not served as frequently on the half shell as in former years, the Blue-point, or the small Wareham, having supplanted them.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Clams.</hd>
<p>There are two kinds of this shell-fish, the common thin-shelled clam and the quahaug. The first is the most abundant. It is sold by the peck or bushel in the shell, or by the quart when shelled. Clams are in season all the year, but in summer a black substance is found in the body, which must be pressed from it before using. The shell of the quahaug is thick and round.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=52"/>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Scollops.</hd>
<p>This shell-fish is used about the same as the clam, but is not so popular, owing to a peculiarly sweet flavor. It is in season from September to March, and is sold shelled, as only the muscular part of the fish is used.</p>

<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" size="larger">VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>Every good housekeeper will supply her table with a variety of vegetables all the year round. One can hardly think of a vegetable, either fresh or canned, that cannot be had in our markets at any season. The railroads and steamers connect the climes so closely that one hardly knows whether he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of season. The provider, however, realizes that it takes a long purse to buy fresh produce at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are so many winter vegetables that keep well in the cellar through cold weather that if we did not have the new ones from the South, there would be, nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. It is late in the spring, when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow rank, that we appreciate what comes from the South.</p>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Buying Vegetables.</hd>
<p>If one has a good, dry cellar, it is economy to procure in the fall vegetables enough for all winter, but if the cellar is too warm the vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold months have passed. Those to be bought are onions, squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, cabbages, potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes, all of which, except the first two, should be bedded in sand and in a cool place, yet where they will not freeze. Squashes and onions should be kept in a very dry room. The price of all depends upon the supply.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
 
<pb n="49" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=53"/>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">When in Season.</hd>
<p>Bermuda sends new potatoes into Northern markets about the last of March or first of April. Florida soon follows, and one Southern State after another continues the supply until June, when the Northern and Eastern districts begin. It is only the rich, however, who can afford new potatoes before July; but the old are good up to that time, if they have been well kept and are properly cooked. Cabbage is in season all the year. Beets, carrots, turnips and onions are received from the South in April and May, so that we have them young and fresh for at least five months. After this period they are not particularly tender, and require much cooking. Squashes come from the South until about May, and we then have the summer squash till the last of August, when the winter squash is first used. This is not as delicate as the summer squash, but is generally liked better. Green peas are found in the market in February, though they are very expensive up to the time of the home supply, which is the middle of June, in an ordinary season, in the Eastern States. They last until the latter part of August, but begin to grow poor before that time. There is a great variety, some being quite large, others very small. The smaller are the more desirable, being much like French peas. When peas are not really in season it is more satisfactory to use French canned peas, costing forty cents a can. One can is enough for six persons. When buying peas, see that the pods are green, dry and cool. If they have turned light they have been picked either a long time or when old.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Spinach.</hd>
<p>Spinach is always in season, but is valued most during the winter and spring, as it is one of the few green vegetables that we get then, and is not expensive. It should be green and crisp.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
 
<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=54"/>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Asparagus.</hd>
<p>Asparagus, from hot houses and the South, begins to come into the market in March and April. It is then costly, but in May and June is abundant and quite cheap. About the last of June it grows poor, and no matter how low the price, it will be an expensive article to buy as it has then become very "woody." The heads should be full and green; if light and not full, the asparagus will not spend well.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Dandelions.</hd>
<p>The cultivated dandelion is found in the market in March, April and a part of May. It is larger, tenderer and less bitter than the wild plant, which begins to get into the market in April. By the last of May the dandelion is too rank and tough to make a good dish.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Cauliflower.</hd>
<p>This vegetable is generally quite expensive. It is found in the market a greater part of the year, being now grown in hot houses in winter. It is in perfection from the first of May to November or December. The leaves should be green and fresh and the heads a creamy white. When the leaves are wilted, or when there are dark spots on the head, the cauliflower is not good.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Tomatoes.</hd>
<p>The fresh tomato comes to the market from the South in April and sometimes in March. On account of the high price it is then used only where the canned tomato will not answer. In July, August and September it is cheap. It comes next to the potato in the variety of forms in which it may be served. By most physicians it is considered a very healthful vegetable. The time to buy ripe tomatoes for canning is about the last of August, when they are abundant and cheap. About the middle or last of September green ones
 
<pb n="51" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=55"/>
should be secured for pickling, etc. As the vines still bear a great many that cannot ripen before the frost comes, these are sold for this purpose.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Beans.</hd>
<p>There are two kinds of green beans in the market, the string or snap bean and the shell bean. String beans come from the South about the first of April. They are picked in Northern gardens about the first of June, and they last until about the middle of July. They should be green, the beans just beginning to form, and should snap crisply. If wilted or yellow they have been picked too long.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Shell Beans.</hd>
<p>Shell beans come in May, but are not picked at the North before June. They are good until the last of September. There is a great variety of shell beans, but the Lima is considered the best. When fresh, shell beans are dry and smooth; but if old, they look dull and sticky.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Celery.</hd>
<p>Celery is found in the market from August to April, but is in its prime and is cheapest from November to the first of March. Before the frost comes it is slightly bitter, and after the first of March it grows tough and stringy. Unless one has a good cellar in which to bury celery, it is best to purchase as one has need from time to time. Celery is a delicious salad. It is also considered one of the best vegetables that a nervous, rheumatic or neuralgic person can take. The heads should be close and white, and the stalks should break off crisply. Save the trimmings for soups.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Lettuce.</hd>
<p>Lettuce is found in the market all the year round, being now raised in hot houses in winter. It then costs two
 
<pb n="52" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=56"/>
and three times as much as in summer; still, it is not an expensive salad. There are a number of varieties having much the same general appearance. That which comes in round heads, with leaves like a shell, is the most popular in this country, because it can be served so handsome. There is another kind, high in favor in Paris and in some localities in this country for its tenderness and delicate flavor, but not liked by marketmen, because it will not bear rough handling. The time will come, however, when there will be such a demand for this species that all first-class provision dealers will keep it. The French call it Romaine, and in this country it is sometimes called Roman lettuce. It does not head. The leaves are long and not handsome whole; but one who uses the lettuce never wishes for any other. Lettuce should be crisp and green, and be kept until used in a very cold place--in an <implement>ice chest</implement> if possible.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Mushrooms.</hd>
<p>Mushrooms are in the market at all seasons. In summer, when they are found in pastures, they are comparatively cheap (fifty or seventy-five cents a pound), but in winter they are high priced. Being, however, very light, a pound goes a great way. The French canned mushrooms are safe, convenient and cheap. One can, costing forty cents, is enough for a sauce for at least ten people. There is nothing else among vegetables which gives such a peculiarly delicious flavor to meat sauces. Mushrooms are used also as a relish for breakfast and tea, or as an entr&#233;e. In gathering from the fields one should exercise great care not to collect poisonous toadstools, which are in appearance much like mushrooms, and are often mistaken for these by people whose knowledge of vegetables has been gained solely by reading. The confusion of the two things has sometimes resulted fatally. There can hardly be danger if purchases are made of reliable provision dealers.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Green Corn.</hd>
<p>Green corn is sent from the South about the last of May or the first of June, and then costs much. It comes from the Middle States about the middle of July and from the Eastern in August, and it lasts into October in the North Eastern States. It should be tender and milky, and have well-filled ears. If too old it will be hard, and the grains straw colored, and no amount of boiling will make it tender. Corn is boiled simply in clear water, is made into chowders, fritters, puddings, succotash, etc.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Artichokes.</hd>
<p>There are two kinds of artichokes, the one best known in this country, the Jerusalem artichoke, being a tuber something like the potato. It is used as a salad, is boiled and served as a vegetable, and is also pickled. This artichoke comes into the market about July, and can be preserved in sand for winter use.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">The Globe Artichoke.</hd>
<p>A thick, fleshy-petaled flower grows on a plant that strongly resembles the thistle; this flower is the part that is eaten. It is boiled and served with a white sauce, and is also eaten as a salad. It is much used in France, but we have so many vegetables with so much more to recommend them, that this will probably never be common in this country.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Cucumbers.</hd>
<p>Cucumbers are in the market all the year round. In winter they are raised in green houses and command a high price. They begin to come from the South about the first of April, and by the last of May the price is reasonable. They last through the summer, but are not very nice after August. They are mostly used as a salad and for pickles, but are often cooked. They should be perfectly green and
 
<pb n="54" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=58"/>
firm for a salad, and when to be pickled, they must be small. If for cooking, it does no harm to have them a little large and slightly turned yellow.</p>

<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Radishes.</hd>
<p>There are two forms of the radish commonly found in the market, the long radish and the small round one. They are in the market in all seasons, and in early spring and summer the price is low. Radishes are used mostly as a relish.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Chicory or Endive.</hd>
<p>The roots and leaves of this plant are both used, but the leaves only are found in the market (the roots are used in coffee), and these come in heads like the lettuce. Chicory comes into the market later than lettuce, and is used in all respects like it. Sometimes it is cooked.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sweet Herbs.</hd>
<p>The housekeeper in large cities has no difficulty in finding all the herbs she may want, but this is not so in small towns and villages. The very fact, however, that one lives in a country place suggests a remedy. Why not have a little bed of herbs in your own garden, and before they go to seed, dry what you will need for the winter and spring? Thus, in summer you could always have the fresh herbs, and in winter have your supply of dried.</p>
<p>It is essential to have green parsley throughout the winter, and this can be managed very easily by having two or three pots planted with healthy roots in the fall. Or, a still better way is to have large holes bored in the sides of a large tub or keg; then fill up to the first row of holes with rich soil; put the roots of the plants through the holes, having the leaves on the outside; fill up again with soil and continue this until the tub is nearly full; then plant the top with
 
<pb n="55" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=59"/>
roots. Keep in a sunny window and you will have not only a useful herb, but a thing of beauty through the winter.</p>
<p>For soups, sauces, stews and braising, one wants sweet marjoram, summer savory, thyme, parsley, sage, tarragon and bay-leaf always on hand. You can get bunches of savory, sage, marjoram and thyme for five cents each at the vegetable market. Five cents' worth of bay-leaves from the drug shop will complete the list (save tarragon, which is hard to find), and you have for a quarter of a dollar herbs enough to last a large family a year. Keep them tied together in a large paper bag or a box, where they will be dry. Mint and parsley should be used green. There is but little difficulty in regard to mint, as it is used only in the spring and summer.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">GROCERIES.</hd>
<p>The manner in which a housekeeper buys her groceries must depend upon where she lives and how large her family is. In a country place, where the stores are few and not well supplied, it is best to buy in large quantities all articles that will not deteriorate by keeping. If one has a large family a great saving is made by purchasing the greater portion of one's groceries at wholesale.</p>
<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Flour.</hd>
<p>There is now in use flour made by two different processes, by the old, or St. Louis, and the new, or Haxall. The Haxall flour is used mostly for bread and the old-process for pastry, cake, etc. By the new process more starch and less of the outer coats, which contain much of the prosphates, is retained; so that the flour makes a whiter and moister bread. This flour packs closer than that made in the old way, so that a pound of it will not measure as much as a pound of the old kind. In using an old rule, one-eighth of this flour should be left out. For instance, if in a recipe for bread you have four quarts (old-process) of flour given, of the new-process you would take only three and a half quarts. This flour does not make as good cake and pastry as the old-process. It is, therefore, well, to have a barrel of each, if you have space, for the pastry flour is the cheaper, and the longer all kinds of flour are kept in a <emph rend="italic">dry</emph>place, the better they are. Buying in small quantities is
 
<pb n="57" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=61"/>
extremely extravagant. When you have become accustomed to one brand, and it works to your satisfaction, do not change for a new one. The <emph rend="italic">best</emph> flour is the cheapest. There are a great many brands that are equally good.</p>

<p>The best Graham is made by grinding good wheat and not sifting it. Much that is sold is a poor quality of flour mixed with bran. This will not, of course, make good, sweet bread. The "Arlington Whole Wheat Meal" is manufactured from pure wheat, and makes delicious bread. Graham, like flour, will keep in a cool, dry place for years.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Indian Meal.</hd>
<p>In most families there is a large amount of this used, but the quantity purchased at a time depends upon the kind of meal selected. The common kind, which is made by grinding between two <implement>mill-stones,</implement> retains a great deal of moisture, and, in hot weather, will soon grow musty; but the granulated meal will keep for any length of time. The corn for this meal is first dried; and it takes about two years for this. Then the outer husks are removed, and the corn is ground by a process that produces grains like granulated sugar. After once using this meal one will not willingly go back to the old kind. Indian meal is made from two kinds of corn, Northern and Southern. The former gives the yellow meal, and is much richer than the Southern, of which white meal is made.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Rye Meal.</hd>
<p>This meal, like the old-process Indian, will grow musty in a short time in hot weather, so that but a small quantity of it should be bought at a time. The meal is much better than the flour for all kinds of bread and muffins.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Oat Meal.</hd>
<p>There are several kinds of oat meal--Scotch, Irish, Canadian
 
<pb n="58" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=62"/>
and American. The first two are sold in small packages, the Canadian and American in any quantity. It seems as if the Canadian and American should be the best because the freshest; but the fact is the others are considered the choicest. Many people could not eat oat meal in former years, owing to the husks irritating the lining of the stomach. There is now what is called pearled meal. All the husks are removed, and the oats are then cut. The coarse kind will keep longer than the fine ground, but it is best to purchase often, and have the meal as fresh as possible.</p>

<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Cracked Wheat.</hd>
<p>This is the whole wheat just crushed or cut like the coarse oat meal, but unlike the meal. It will keep a long time. It is cooked the same as oat meal. That which is cut makes a handsomer dish than the crushed, but the latter cooks more quickly.</p>

<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Hominy.</hd>
<p>This is made from corn, and it comes in a number of sizes, beginning with samp and ending with a grade nearly as fine as coarse-granulated sugar. The finest grade is really the best, so many nice dishes can be made with it which you cannot make with the coarse. Hominy will keep a long time, and it can be bought in five-pound package or by the barrel.</p>

<section class1="marketing">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Sugar.</hd>
<p>The fine-granulated sugar is the best and cheapest for general family use. It is pure and dry; therefore, there is more in one pound of it than in a damp, brown sugar, besides its sweetening power being considerably greater. The price of sugar at wholesale is not much less than at retail, but time and trouble are saved by purchasing by the barrel.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Spice.</hd>
<p>It is well to keep on hand all kinds of spice, both whole and ground. They should not be in large quantities, as a good cook will use them very sparingly, and a good housekeeper will have too much regard for the health of her family and the delicacy of her food to have them used lavishly. For soups and sauces the whole spice is best, as it gives a delicate flavor, and does not color. A small wooden or tin box should be partly filled with whole mace, cloves, allspice and cinnamon, and a smaller <implement>paste-board box,</implement> full of pepper-corns, should be placed in it. By this plan you will have all your spices together when you season a soup or sauce.</p>

<p>There should not be so much of these articles used as to require that they be purchased in large quantities. Cream of tartar is expensive, soda cheap. If one prefers to use baking powders there will be no need of cream of tartar, but the soda will still be required for gingerbread and brown bread, and to use with sour milk, etc. The advantage of baking powder is that it is prepared by chemists who know just the proportion of soda to use with the acid (which should be cream of tartar), and the result will be invariable if the cook is exact in measuring the other ingredients. When an inexperienced cook uses the soda and cream of tartar there is apt to be a little too much of one or the
 
<pb n="60" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=64"/>
other. Just now, with the failure of the grape crops in France, from which a greater part of the crystals in use come, cream of tartar is extremely high, and substitutes, such as phosphates, are being used.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">To be Always Kept on Hand.</hd>
<p>Besides the things already mentioned, housekeepers should always have a supply of rice, pearl barley, dried beans, split peas, tapioca, macaroni, vermicilli, tea, coffee, chocolate, corn-starch, molasses, vinegar, mustard, pepper, salt, capers, canned tomato, and any other canned vegetables of which a quantity is used. Of the many kind of molasses, Porto Rico is the best for cooking purposes. It is well to have a few such condiments as curry powder (a small bottle will last for years), Halford sauce, essence of anchovies and mushroom ketchup. These give variety to the flavoring, and, if used carefully, will not be an expensive addition, so little is needed for a dish.</p>

<hd size="larger" align="center">CARE OF FOOD.</hd>
<p>A great saving is made by the proper care and use of cooked and uncooked food. The first and great consideration is perfect cleanliness. The <implement>ice chest</implement> and cellar should be thoroughly cleaned once a week; the jars in which bread is kept must be washed, scalded and dried thoroughly at least twice a week. When cooked food is placed in either the <implement>ice chest</implement> or cellar it should be perfectly cool; if not, it will absorb an unpleasant flavor from the close atmosphere of either place. Meat should not be put directly on the ice, as the water draws out the juices. Always place it in a pan, and this may be set on the ice. When you have a refrigerator where the meat can be hung, a pan is not needed. In winter, too, when one has a cold room, it is best to hang meats there. These remarks apply, of course, only to joints and fowl. The habit which many people have of putting steaks, chops, etc., in the wrapping paper on ice, is a very bad one. When purchasing meat always have the trimmings sent home, as they help to make soups and sauces. Every scrap of meat and bone left from roasts and broils should be saved for the <implement>soup-pot.</implement> Trimmings from ham, tongue, corned beef, etc., should all be saved for the many relishes they will make. Cold fish can be used in salads and warmed up in many palatable ways. In fact, nothing that comes on the table is enjoyed more than the little dishes which an artistic cook will make from the odds and ends left from a former meal. By artistic cook is meant not a professional,
 
<pb n="62" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=66"/>
but a woman who believes in cleanliness and hot dishes, and that there is something in the appearance as well as in the taste of the food, and who does not believe that a quantity of butter, or of some kind of fat, is essential to the success of nearly every dish cooked. The amount of food spoiled by butter, <emph rend="italic">good</emph> butter too, is surprising.</p>
<p>One should have a number of plates for cold food, that each kind may be kept by itself. The fat trimmings from beef, pork, veal, chickens and fowl should be tried out while fresh, and then strained. The fowl and chicken fat ought to be kept in a pot by itself, for shortening and delicate frying. Have a stone pot for it, holding about a quart, and another, holding three or four quarts, for the other kinds. The fat that has been skimmed from soups, boiled beef and fowl, should be cooked rather slowly until the sediment falls to the bottom and there is not the shadow of a bubble. It can then be strained into the jar with the other fat; but if strained while bubbles remain, there is water in it, and it will spoil quickly. The fat from sausages can also be strained into the larger pot. Another pot, holding about three quarts, should be kept for the fat in which articles of food have been fried. When you have finished frying, set the kettle in a cool place for about half an hour; then pour the fat into the pot through a fine strainer, being careful to keep back the sediment, which scrape into the soap-grease. In this way you can fry in the same fat a dozen times, while if you are not careful to strain it each time, the crumbs left will burn and blacken all the fat. Occasionally, when you have finished frying, cut up two or three uncooked potatoes and put into the boiling fat. Set on the back of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes; then set in a cool place for fifteen minutes longer, and strain. The potatoes clarify the fat. Many people use ham fat for cooking purposes; and when there is no objection to the flavor, it is nice
 
<pb n="63" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=67"/>
for frying eggs, potatoes, etc. But it should not be mixed with other kinds. The fat from mutton, lamb, geese, turkey or ducks will give an unpleasant flavor to anything with which it is used, and the best place for it is with the soap-grease. Every particle of soup and gravy should be saved, as a small quantity of either adds a great deal to many little dishes. The quicker food of all kinds cools the longer it keeps. This should be particularly remembered with soups and bread.</p>
<p>Bread and cake must be thoroughly cooled before being put into box or jar. If not, the steam will cause them to mold quickly. Crusts and pieces of stale bread should be dried in a slow oven, rolled into fine crumbs on a board, and put away for croquettes, cutlets or anything that is breaded. Pieces of stale bread can be used for toast, griddle-cakes and puddings and for dressing for poultry and other kinds of meat. Stale cake can be made into puddings.</p>
<p>The best tub butter will keep perfectly well without a brine if kept in a cool, sweet room. It is more healthful and satisfactory to buy the choicest tub butter and use it for table and cooking purposes than to provide a fancy article for the table and use an inferior one in the preparation of the food. If, from any cause, butter becomes rancid, to each pint of it add one table-spoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of soda, and mix well; then add one pint of cold water, and set on the fire until it comes to the boiling point. Now set away to cool, and when cool and hard, take off the butter in a cake. Wipe dry and put away for cooking purposes. It will be perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>Milk, cream and butter all quickly absorb strong odors; therefore, care must be taken to keep them in a cool, sweet room or in an <implement>ice chest.</implement> Cheese should be wrapped in a piece of clean linen and kept in a box. Berries must be kept in a cool place, and uncovered.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">KITCHEN FURNISHING.</hd>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Stove, or Range?</hd>
<p>The question often arises, even with old housekeepers, Which shall it be--a stove or a range? There are strong points in favor of each. For a small kitchen the range may be commended, because it occupies the least space, and does not heat a room as intensely as a stove, although it will heat water enough for kitchen and bath-room purposes for a large family. That the range is popular is evident from the fact that nearly every modern house is supplied with one; and thus the cost of, and cartage for, stoves is generally saved to tenants in these days.</p>
<p>There are these advantage of a stove over a set range: it requires less than half as much fuel and is more easily managed--that is, the fire can be more quickly started, and if it gets too low, more easily replenished and put in working order; and the ovens can be more quickly heated or cooled. But, although you can have a water-back and <implement>boiler</implement> with most modern stoves or, as they are now called, portable ranges, the supply of hot water will not be large. And you cannot roast before the fire as with a range.</p>
<p>So near perfection have the makers of ranges and stoves come that it would be difficult to speak of possible improvements, especially in stoves. This can be said not of a few, 
 
<pb n="65" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=69"/>
but of a great many manufacturers, each having his special merit. And where the products are so generally good, it is hard to mention one make in preference to another. When purchasing, it is well to remember, that one of simple construction is the most easily managed and does not soon get out of order. No single piece of furniture contributes so much to the comfort of a family as the range or stove, which should, therefore, be the best of its kind.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Gas and Oil Stoves.</hd>
<p>During the hot weather a gas or oil stove is a great comfort. The "Sun Dial," manufactured by the Goodwin Gas Stove Co., Philadelphia, is a "perfect gem," roasting, baking, broiling, etc., as well as a coal stove or range. Indeed, meats roasted or broiled by it are jucier than when cooked over or before coals. The peculiar advantage of oil and gas stoves is that they can be conveniently used for a short time, say for the preparation of a meal, at a trifling expense. The cost of running a gas stove throughout the day is, however, much greater than that of a coal stove, while an oil stove can be run cheaper than either.</p>
<p>There are a great many manufacturers of oil stoves, and as a natural consequence, where there is so much competition, the stoves are nearly all good. One would not think of doing the cooking for a large family with one or, indeed, two of them; but the amount of work that can be accomplished with a single stove is remarkable. They are a great comfort in hot weather, many small families doing their entire cooking with them.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center" rend="bold">Refrigerators.</hd>
<p>The trouble with most refrigerators is that the food kept in them is apt to have a peculiar taste. This is owing in a great measure to the wood used in the construction of the
 
<pb n="66" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=70"/>
interior and for the shelves. On the inside of the Eddy chest-shaped refrigerator there is not a particle of wood, and the food kept in it is always sweet. It is simply a chest, where the ice is placed on the bottom and slate shelves put on top. With this style of refrigerator the waste of ice is much greater than in those built with a separate compartment for ice, but the food is more healthful.</p>

<section class1="soups">
<hd rend="bold" align="center">Remarks on Soup Stock.</hd>
<p>There is a number of methods of making soup stocks, and no two will give exactly the same results. One of the simplest and most satisfactory is that of clear stock or bouillon. By this the best flavor of the meat is obtained, for none passes off in steam, as when the meat is boiled rapidly. The second mode is in boiling the stock a great deal, to reduce it. This gives a very rich soup, with a marked difference in the flavor from that made with clear meat kept in water at the boiling point. The third way leaves a mixed stock, which will not be clear unless whites of eggs are used. In following the first methods we buy clear beef specially for the stock, and know from the beginning just how much stock there will be when the work is completed. By the second method we are not sure, because more or less than we estimate may boil away. The third stock, being made from bones and pieces of meat left from roasts, and from the trimmings of raw meats, will always be changeable in color, quantity and quality. This is, however, a very important stock, and it should always be kept on hand. No household, even where only a moderate amount of meat is used, should be without a <implement>stock-pot.</implement> It can be kept on the back of the range or stove while cooking is going on. Two or three times a week it should be put on with the trimmings and bones left from cooked and uncooked meats. This practice will give a supply of stock at all times, which will be of the greatest value in making sauces, side dishes and soups. Meat if only slightly tainted will spoil a stock; therefore
 
<pb n="83" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=87"/>
great care must be taken that every particle is perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>Vegetables make a stock sour very quickly, so if you wish to keep a stock do not use them. Many rules advise putting vegetables into the <implement>stock-pot</implement> with the meat and water and cooking from the very beginning. When this is done they absorb the fine flavor of the meat and give the soup a rank taste. They should cook not more than an hour--the last hour-in the stock. A white stock is made with veal or poultry. The water in which a leg of mutton or fowl have been boiled makes a good stock for light soups and gravies. A soup stock must be cooled quickly or it will not keep well. In winter any kind of stock ought to keep good a week. That boiled down to a jelly will last the longest. In the warm months three days will be the average time stock will keep.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">A General Chapter on Fish.</hd>
<p>It may seem as if a small number of recipes has been given, but the aim has been to present under the heads of Baking, Boiling, Broiling, Frying and Stewing such general directions that one cannot be at a loss as to how to prepare any kind of fish. Once having mastered the five primary methods, and learned also how to make sauces, the variety of dishes within the cook's power is great. All that is required is confidence in the rules, which are perfectly reliable, and will always bring about a satisfactory result if followed carefully. Fish, to be eatable, should be perfectly fresh. Nothing else in the line of food deteriorates so rapidly, especially the white fish--those that are nearly free of oil, like cod, cusk, etc. Most of the oil in this class centres in the liver. Salmon, mackerel, etc., have it distributed throughout the body, which gives a higher and richer flavor, and at the same time tends to preserve the fish. People who do not live near the seashore do not get that delicious flavor which fish just caught have. If the fish is kept on ice until used, it will retain much of its freshness; let it once get heated and nothing will bring back the delicate flavor. Fresh fish will be firm, and the skin and scales bright. When fish looks dim and limp, do not buy it. Fish should
 
<pb n="104" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=108"/>
be washed quickly in only one <emph rend="italic">(cold)</emph> water, and should not be allowed to stand in it. If it is cut up before cooking, wash while whole, else much of the flavor will be lost. For frying, the fat should be deep enough to cover the article, and yet have it float from the bottom. Unless one cooks great quantities of fish in this way it is not necessary to have a separate pot of fat for this kind of frying. The same pot, with proper care, will answer for chops, cutlets, muffins, potatoes, croquettes, etc. All the cold fish left from any mode of cooking can be utilized in making delicious salads, croquettes, and escallops.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Fish.</purpose>
A general rule for boiling <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> which will hold good for all kinds, and thus save a great deal of time and space, is this: Any fresh fish weighing between four and six pounds should be first washed in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and then put into boiling water enough to cover it, and containing one table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Simmer gently thirty minutes; then take up. A <implement>fish kettle</implement> is a great convenience, and it can be used also for boiling hams. When you do not have a <implement>fish kettle,</implement> keep a piece of strong white cotton cloth in which pin the fish before putting into the boiling water. This will hold it in shape. Hard boiling will break the fish, and, of course, there will be great waste, besides the dish's not looking so handsome and appetizing. There should be a gentle bubbling of the water, and nothing more, all the time the fish is in it. A fish weighing more than six pounds should cook five minutes longer for every additional <emph rend="italic">two</emph> pounds. Boiled fish can be served with a great variety of sauces. After you have learned to make them (which is a simple matter), if you cannot get a variety of fish you will not miss it particularly, the sauce and mode of serving doing much to change the whole character of the dish. Many people put a table-spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in the water in
 
<pb n="105" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=109"/>
which the fish is boiled. The fish flakes a little more readily for it. Small fish, like trout, require from four to eight minutes to cook. They are, however, much better baked, broiled or fried.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Court-Bouillon.</purpose>
This preparation gives boiled fish a better flavor than cooking in clear water does. Many cooks use wine in it, but there is no necessity for it. Four quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> one <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> one slice of <ingredient>carrot,</ingredient> two <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> one teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> one table-spoonful of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> the <ingredient>juice of half a lemon</ingredient> and a bouquet of <ingredient>sweet herbs</ingredient> are used. Tie the onion, carrot, cloves and herbs in a piece of muslin, and put in the water with the other ingredients. Cover, and boil slowly for one hour. Then put in the fish and cook as directed for plain boiling.</p>

The same as cod. In fact, all kinds of fish can be served in the same manner; but the lighter are the better, as the sauce is so rich that it is not really the thing for salmon and blue fish. Many of the best cooks and caterers, however, use the lobster sauce with salmon, but salmon has too rich and delicate a flavor to be mixed with the lobster.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Cold Boiled Fish, &#224; la Vinaigrette.</purpose>
If the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is whole, take off the head and skin, and then
 
<pb n="106" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=110"/>
place it in the centre of a dish. Have two cold <ingredient>hard-boiled eggs,</ingredient> and cut fine with a silver knife or spoon, (steel turns the egg black). Sprinkle the fish with this, and garnish either with small <ingredient>lettuce leaves,</ingredient> <ingredient>water-cresses,</ingredient> or cold <ingredient>boiled potatoes</ingredient> and <ingredient>beets,</ingredient> cut in slices. Place tastefully around the dish, with here and there a sprig of parsley. Serve the <ingredient>vinaigrette sauce</ingredient> in a separate dish. Help to the garnish when the fish is served, and pour a spoonful of the sauce over the fish as you serve it. This makes a nice dish for tea in summer, and takes the place of a salad, as it is, in fact, a kind of salad.</p>
<p>If the fish is left from the dinner, and is broken, pick free from skin and bones, heap it lightly in the centre of the dish, sprinkle the sauce over it, and set away in a cool place until tea time. Then add the garnish, and serve as before. Many people prefer the latter method, as the fish is seasoned better and more easily served. The cold fish remaining from a bake or broil can be served in the same manner. <variation>This same dish can be served with a sauce piquante or Tartare sauce, for a change.</variation></p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Baked Fish.</purpose>
As for the boiled fish, a general rule, that will cover all kinds of baked fish, is herewith given: A <ingredient>fish</ingredient> weighing about five pounds; three large, or five small, <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> quarter of a pound of <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> quarter of a teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> half a table-spoonful of chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>
<p>If the fish has not already been scraped free of scales, scrape, and wash clean; then rub into it one table-spoonful of the salt.

Put this into the body of the fish, and fasten

together with a <implement>skewer.</implement> <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> a tin sheet and put it into a <implement>baking pan.</implement> Cut gashes across the fish, about half an inch deep and two inches long. Cut the remainder of the pork into strips, and put these into the gashes. Now put the fish into the <implement>baking pan,</implement> and dredge well with salt, pepper and flour. Cover the bottom of the pan with hot water, and put into a rather hot oven. Bake one hour, basting often with the gravy in the pan, and dredging each time with salt, pepper and flour. The water in the pan must often be renewed, as the bottom is simply to be covered with it each time. The fish should be basted every fifteen minutes. When it is cooked, lift from the pan on to the tin sheet, and slide it carefully into the centre of the dish on which it is to be served. Pour around it <ingredient>Hollandaise sauce,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomato sauce,</ingredient> or any kind you like. Garnish with <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient></p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Broiled Fish.</purpose>
<ingredient>Bluefish,</ingredient> <ingredient>young cod,</ingredient> <ingredient>mackerel,</ingredient> <ingredient>salmon,</ingredient> large <ingredient>trout,</ingredient> and all other fish, when they weigh between half a pound and four pounds, are nice for broiling. When smaller or larger they are not so good. Always use a <implement>double broiler,</implement> which, before putting the fish into it, rub with either <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or a piece of <ingredient>salt pork.</ingredient> This prevents sticking. The thickness of the fish will have to be the guide in broiling. A bluefish weighing four pounds will take from twenty minutes to half an hour to cook. Many cooks brown the fish handsomely over the coals and then put it into the oven to finish broiling. Where the fish is very thick, this is a good plan. If the fish is taken from the <implement>broiler</implement> to be put into the oven, it should be slipped on to a tin sheet, that it may slide easily into the platter at serving time; for nothing so mars a dish of fish as to have it come to the table broken. In broiling, the inside should be exposed to the fire first, and then the skin. Great care must be taken that the skin does
 
<pb n="108" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=112"/>
not burn. Mackerel will broil in from twelve to twenty minutes, young cod (also called scrod) in from twenty to thirty minutes, bluefish in from twenty to thirty minutes, salmon, in from twelve to twenty minutes, and whitefish, bass, mullet, etc., in about eighteen minutes. All kinds of broiled fish can be served with a seasoning of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and butter, or with any of the following sauces: <ingredient><emph rend="italic">beurre noir, ma&#238;;tre d' h&#244;tel,</emph></ingredient> <ingredient>Tartare,</ingredient> <ingredient>sharp,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomato and curry.</ingredient> Always, when possible, garnish with parsley or something else green.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Fried Fish.</purpose>
All small <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> like <ingredient>brook trout,</ingredient> <ingredient>smelts,</ingredient> <ingredient>perch,</ingredient> etc., are best fried. They are often called pan-fish for this reason. They should be cleaned, washed and drained, then well salted, and rolled in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> (half of each), which has been thoroughly mixed and salted. For every four pounds of fish have half a pound of <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> cut in thin slices, and fried a crisp brown. Take the pork from the pan and put the fish in, having only enough to cover the bottom. Fry brown on one side; turn, and fry the other side. Serve on a hot dish, with the salt pork as a garnish. Great care must be taken that the pork or fat does not burn, and yet to have it hot enough to brown quickly. Cod, haddock, cusk and halibut are all cut in handsome slices and fried in this manner; or, the slices can be well seasoned with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> dipped in beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> rolled in <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>cracker crumbs</ingredient> and fried in boiling <ingredient>fat</ingredient> enough to cover. This method gives the handsomer dish, but the first the more savory. Where Indian meal is not liked, all flour can be used. Serve very hot. Any kind of fried fish can be served with <emph rend="italic">beurre noir,</emph> but this is particularly nice for that
 
<pb n="110" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=114"/>

Having a perfectly clear and <ingredient>solid block of ice,</ingredient> weighing ten or fifteen pounds, a cavity is to be made in the top of it in either of two ways. The first is to carefully chip with an <implement>ice pick;</implement> the other, to melt with heated bricks. If the latter be chosen the ice must be put into a tub or large pan, and one of the bricks held upon the centre of it until there is a slight depression, yet sufficient for the brick to rest in. When the first brick is cold remove it, tip the block on one side, to let off the water, and then use another brick. Continue the operation till the cavity will hold as many <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> as are to be served.

A quart is enough for a party of ten; but a block of the size given will hold two quarts.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">LOBSTER.</hd>
<p>Lobster, to be eatable, should be perfectly fresh. One of the tests of freshness is to draw back the tail, for if it springs into position again, it is safe to think the fish good. The time of boiling varies with the size of the lobster and in different localities. In Boston, Rockport and other places on the Massachusetts coast the time is fifteen or twenty minutes for large lobsters and ten for small. The usual way is to plunge them into boiling water enough to cover, and to continue boiling them until they are done. Some people advocate putting the lobsters into cold water, and letting this come to a boil gradually. They claim that the lobsters do not suffer so much. This may be so, but it seems as if death must instantly follow the plunge into boiling water. Cooking a lobster too long makes it tough and dry. When, on opening a lobster, you find the meat clinging to the shell, and very much shrunken, you may be sure the time of boiling was too long. There are very few modes of cooking lobster in which it should be more than thoroughly heated, as much cooking toughens it and destroys the fine, delicate flavor of the meat.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">To Open a Lobster.</purpose>
Separate the tail from the body, and shake out the tom-ally,
 
<pb n="125" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=129"/>
and, also, the "coral," if there is any, upon a plate. Then by drawing the body from the shell with the thumb, and pressing the part near the head against the shell with the first and second finger, you will free it from the stomach or "lady." Now split the <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> through the centre and, with a fork, pick the meat from the joints. Cut the under side of the tail shell open and take out the meat without breaking. On the upper part of that end of this meat which joined the body is a small piece of flesh, which should be lifted; and a strip of meat attached to it should be turned back to the extreme end of the tail. This will uncover a little vein, running the entire length, which must be removed. Sometimes this vein is dark, and sometimes as light as the meat itself. It and the stomach are the only parts not eatable. The piece that covered the vein should be turned again into place. Hold the claws on edge on a thick board, and strike hard with a hammer until the shell cracks. Draw apart, and take out the meat. If you have the claws lying flat on the board when you strike, you not only break the shell, but mash the meat, and thus spoil a fine dish.

<p>All pieces, unless very salt, should be plunged into boiling water, and boiled rapidly for fifteen minutes, to harden the albumen that is on the outside, and thus keep in the juices. The kettle should then be put back where it will just simmer, for meat that is boiled rapidly becomes hard and stringy, while that which is kept just at the boiling point (where the water hardly bubbles) will cut tender and juicy, provided there is any juiciness in it at the beginning. White meats, like mutton and poultry, are improved in appearance by having rice boiled with them; or, a still better way is to thickly flour a piece of coarse cotton cloth, pin the meat in it, and place in the boiling water. Meat cooked in this way will be extremely juicy.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">ROASTING.</hd>
<p>There are two modes of roasting: one is to use a <implement>tin kitchen</implement> before an open fire, and the other and more common way is to use a very hot oven. The former gives the more delicious favor, but the second is not by any means a poor way, if the meat is put on a rack, and basted constantly when in the oven. A large piece is best for roasting, this being especially true of beef. When meat is cooked in a <implement>tin-kitchen</implement> it requires more time, because the heat is not equally distributed, as it is in the oven.</p>
<p>To prepare for roasting: Wipe the meat with a wet towel. Dredge on all sides with salt, pepper and flour; and if the kitchen is used, dredge the flour into that. Run the spit through the centre of the meat, and place very near the fire at first, turning as it browns. When the flour in the kitchen is browned, add a pint of hot water, and baste frequently with it, dredging with salt and flour after each basting. Roast a piece of beef weighing eight pounds fifty minutes, if to be rare, but if to be medium, roast one hour and a quarter, and ten minutes for each additional pound.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Roasting in the Oven.</purpose>
Prepare the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> as before. Have a rack that will fit loosely into the <implement>baking-pan.</implement> Cover the bottom of the pan rather lightly with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> put in rack, and then meat. Place in a very hot oven for a few minutes, to brown the flour in the pan, and then add <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Close the oven; and in about ten minutes, open, and baste the meat with the <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient> Dredge with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and flour. Do this every fifteen minutes; and as soon as one side of the meat is brown, turn, and brown the other. Make gravy as before. Allow a quarter of an hour less in the oven than in the <implement>tin kitchen.</implement> The heat for roasting
 
<pb n="133" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=137"/>
must be very great at first, to harden the albumen, and thus keep in the juices. After the meat is crusted over it is not necessary to keep up so great a heat, but for rare <ingredient>meats</ingredient> the heat must, of course, be greater than for those that are to be well done. The kitchen can be drawn back a little distance from the fire and the drafts closed. Putting salt on fresh meat draws out the juices, but by using flour a paste is formed, which keeps in all the juices and also enriches and browns the piece. <emph rend="italic">Never</emph> roast meat without having a rack in the pan. If meat is put into the water in the pan it becomes soggy and looses its flavor. A <implement>meat-rack</implement> costs not more than thirty or forty cents, and the improvement in the looks and flavor of a piece of meat is enough to pay for it in one roasting.</p>
<p>The time given for roasting a piece of beef is for rib roasts and sirloin. The same weight in the face or the back of the rump will require twenty minutes longer, as the meat on these cuts is in a very compact form.</p>
<p>If a saddle or loin of mutton is to be roasted, cook the same time as beef if the weight is the same; but if a leg is to be roasted, one hour and a quarter is the time. Lamb should be cooked an hour and a half; veal, two hours and three-quarters; pork, three hours and a quarter. Ten minutes before dishing the dinner turn the gravy into a sauce-pan, skim off all the fat, and set on the stove. Let it come to a boil; then stir in one table-spoonful of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> mixed with half a cupful of <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and cook two minutes.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Roast Beef, with Yorkshire Pudding.</purpose>
A <ingredient>rib</ingredient> or <ingredient>sirloin roast</ingredient> should be prepared as directed for roasting. When within three-quarters of an hour of being done, have the pudding made. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> a pan like that in which the meat is being cooked, and pour in the batter. Put the rack <emph rend="italic">across</emph> the pan, not <emph rend="italic">in</emph> it. Place the meat on the rack, return to the oven, and cook forty-five minutes. If you have only one pan, take up the meat, pour off the gravy and put in the pudding. Cut in squares, and garnish the beef with these. Another method is to have a pan that has squares stamped in it. This gives even squares and crust on all the edges, which baking in the flat pan does not. When the meat is roasted in the <implement>tin-kitchen,</implement> let the pudding bake in the oven for half an hour, and then place it under the meat to catch the drippings.</p>
<p>For the Yorkshire pudding, one pint of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> two-thirds of a cupful of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> three <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and one scant teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> will be needed.

<hd align="center" size="larger">BROILING.</hd>
<p>The fire for broiling must be clear, and for meats it must be hotter and brighter than for fish. Coals from hard wood or charcoal are best, but in all large towns and cities hard coal is nearly always used, except in hotels and restaurants, where there is usually a special place for broiling with charcoal. The <implement>double broiler</implement> is the very best thing in the market for broiling meats and fish. When the meat is placed in it, and the slide is slipped over the handles, all there is to do is to hold the <implement>broiler</implement> over the fire, or, if you have an open range, before the fire. A fork or knife need not go near the meat until it is on the dish. A great amount of the juice is saved. With the old-fashioned <implement>gridirons</implement> it is absolutely necessary to stick a fork into the meat to turn it, and although there are little grooves for the gravy to run into, what is saved in this way does not compare with what is actually kept within the meat where the <implement>double broiler</implement> is used. Professional cooks can turn a steak without running a fork into the meat, but not one in a hundred common cooks can do it.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">To Clean and Truss Poultry.</purpose>
First singe, by holding the <ingredient>bird</ingredient> over a blazing paper. It is best to do this over the open stove, when all the particles of burnt paper will fall into the fire. Next open the vent and draw out the internal organs, if this has not been done at the butcher's. Be careful not to break the gall bladder. Wash quickly in one water. If there are large black pin-feathers, take out what you can with the point of a knife, (it is impossible to get out all). Cut the oil bag from the tail. Be sure that you have taken out every part of the wind-pipe, the lights and crop. Turn the skin back, and cut the neck quite short. Fill the crop with dressing, and put some in the body also. With a short <implement>skewer,</implement> fasten the legs together at the joint where the feet were cut off. [Be careful, in cutting off the feet of game or <ingredient>poultry,</ingredient> to cut in the joint. If you cut above, the ligaments that hold the flesh and bones together will be severed, and in cooking, the meat will shrink, leaving a bare, unsightly bone. Besides, you will have nothing to hold the <implement>skewer,</implement> if the ligaments are cut off.] Run the <implement>skewer</implement> into the bone of the tail, and tie firmly with a long piece of twine. Now take a longer <implement>skewer,</implement> and run
 
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=147"/>
through the two wings, fastening them firmly to the sides of the bird. With another short <implement>skewer,</implement> fasten the skin of the neck on to the back-bone. Place the bird on its breast, and draw the strings, with which the legs were tied, around the <implement>skewers</implement> in the wings and neck; pass them across the back three times, and tie very tightly. By following these directions, you will have the bird in good shape, and all the strings on the back, so that you will avoid breaking the handsome crust that always forms on properly basted and roasted poultry. When cooked, first cut the strings, then draw out the <implement>skewers.</implement> The fat that comes from the vent and the gizzard of <ingredient>chickens,</ingredient> should be tried out immediately and put away for shortening and frying. That of <ingredient>geese,</ingredient> <ingredient>turkeys</ingredient> and <ingredient>ducks</ingredient> is of too strong a flavor to be nice in cookery.</p>
<p>To clean the giblets: Cut the gall-bag from the lobe of the liver, cutting a little of the liver with it, so as not to cut into the bag. Press the heart between the finger and thumb, to extract all the blood. With a sharp knife, cut lightly around the gizzard, and draw off the outer coat, leaving the lining coat whole. If you cannot do that (and it does require practice), cut in two, and after removing the filling, take out the lining. When the poultry is to be boiled, and is stuffed, the vent must be sewed with mending cotton or soft twine. Unless the bird is full of dressing, this will not be necessary in roasting.</p></recipe>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boned Turkey.</purpose>
Get a <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> that has not been frozen (freezing makes it tear easily). See that every part is whole; one with a little break in the skin will not do. Cut off the legs, in the joints, and the tips of the wings. Do not draw the bird. Place it on its breast, and with a small, sharp <implement>boning knife,</implement> cut in a straight line through to the bone, from the neck down to that part of the bird where there is but little flesh, where it is all
 
<pb n="146" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=150"/>
skin and fat. Begin at the neck, and run the knife between the flesh and the bones until you come to the wing. Then cut the ligaments that hold the bones together and the tendons that hold the flesh to the bones. With the thumb and fore-finger, <emph rend="italic">press</emph> the flesh from the smooth bone. When you come to the joint, carefully separate the ligaments and remove the bone. Do not try to take the bone from the next joint, as that is not in the way when carving, and it gives a more natural shape to the bird. Now begin at the wish-bone, and when that is free from the flesh, run the knife between the sides and the flesh, always using the fingers to press the meat from the smooth bones, as, for instance, the breast-bone and lower part of the sides. Work around the legs the same as you did around the wings, always using great care at the joints not to cut the skin. Drawing out the leg bones turns that part of the bird inside out. Turn the bird over, and proceed in the same manner with the other side. When all is detached, carefully draw the skin from the breast-bone; then run the knife between the fat and bone at the rump, leaving the small bone in the extreme end, as it holds the <implement>skewers.</implement> Carefully remove the flesh from the skeleton, and turn it right side out again. Rub into it two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and fill with <ingredient>dressing.</ingredient> Sew up the back and neck and then the vent. Truss the same as if not boned. Take a strong piece of cotton cloth and pin the bird firmly in it, drawing very tight at the legs, as this is the broadest place, and the shape will not be good unless this precaution be taken. Steam three hours, and then place on a buttered tin sheet, which put in a <implement>baking pan.</implement> Baste well with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Roast one hour, basting every ten minutes, and twice with stock. When cold, remove the <implement>skewers</implement> and strings, and garnish with <ingredient>aspic jelly,</ingredient> cooked <ingredient>beets</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient> To carve: First cut off the wings, then about two thick slices from the neck, where
 
<pb n="147" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=151"/>
it will be quite fat, and then cut in thin slices. Serve jelly with each plate.</p>
<p>Filling for a <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> weighing eight pounds: The flesh of one <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> weighing four pounds, one pound of clear <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> half a pound of clear <ingredient>salt pork,</ingredient> one small cupful of <ingredient>cracker crumbs,</ingredient> two <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> one cupful of <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> two and a half table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> one teaspoonful of <ingredient>summer savory,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>sweet majoram,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>thyme,</ingredient> half a spoonful of <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and, if you like, one table-spoonful of <ingredient>capers,</ingredient> one quart of <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>onion juice.</ingredient> Have the meat uncooked and free from any tough pieces. Chop <emph rend="italic">very</emph> fine. Add seasoning, crackers, etc., mix thoroughly, and use. If oysters are used, half a pound of the veal must be omitted. Where one cannot eat veal, use chicken instead. Veal is recommended for its cheapness. Why people choose boned turkey instead of a plain roast turkey or chicken, is not plain, for the flavor is not so good; but at the times and places where boned birds are used, it is a very appropriate dish. That is, at suppers, lunches and parties, where the guests are served standing, it is impracticable to provide anything that cannot be broken with a fork or spoon; therefore, the advantage of a boned turkey, chicken or bird, is apparent. One turkey weighing eight pounds before being boned, will serve thirty persons at a party, if there are, also, say oysters, rolls, coffee, ices, cake and cream. If the supper is very elaborate the turkey will answer for one of the dishes for a hundred or more persons. If nothing more were gained in the boning of a bird, the knowledge of the anatomy and the help this will give in carving, pay to bone two or three chickens. It is advisable to bone at least two fowls before trying a turkey, for if you spoil them there is nothing lost, as they make a stew or soup.</p>

amber jelly, and <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> or <ingredient>veal</ingredient> if for white; half a box of gelatine, the <ingredient>white of one egg,</ingredient> half a cupful of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> two <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> one large slice of <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> twelve <ingredient>pepper-corns,</ingredient> one stalk of <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Soak gelatine two hours in the cold water.

Strain through a napkin, turn into a mould or shallow dish, and put away to harden. The jelly can be made with the bones of the turkey and chicken, by washing them, covering with cold water and boiling down to about three pints; by then straining and setting away to cool, and in the morning skimming off all the fat and turning off the the clear stock. The bones may, instead, be used for a soup.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Roast Chicken.</purpose>
Clean the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and stuff the breast and part of the body with dressing made as follows: For a pair of chickens weighing between seven and eight pounds, take one quart of <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> (being sure not to have any hard pieces), and break up in very fine crumbs. Add a table-spoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a scant teaspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> a teaspoonful of chopped <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>powdered sage,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>summer savory</ingredient> and a scant half cupful of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Mix well together. This gives a rich dressing that will separate like rice when served. Now truss the chickens, and dredge well with salt. Take soft butter in the hand, and rub thickly over the chicken; then dredge rather thickly with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Place on the side, on the <implement>meat rack,</implement> and put into a hot oven for a few moments, that the flour in the bottom of the pan may brown. When it is browned, put in <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cover the pan. Baste every fifteen minutes with the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> in the pan, and dredge with salt, pepper and flour. When one side is browned, turn, and brown the other. The last position in which the chicken should bake is on its back, that the breast may be nicely frothed and browned. The last basting is on the breast, and should be done with soft butter, and the breast should be dredged with flour. Putting the butter on the chicken at first, and then covering with flour, makes a paste, which keeps the juices in the chicken, and also supplies a certain amount of rich basting that is absorbed into the meat. It really does not take as much butter to baste poultry or game in this manner as by the old method of putting it on with a
 
<pb n="150" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=154"/>
spoon after the bird began to cook. The water in the pan must often be renewed; and always be careful not to get in too much at a time. It will take an hour and a quarter to cook a pair of chickens, each weighing between three and a half and four pounds; anything larger, an hour and a half. A sure sign that they are done is the readiness of joints to separate from the body. If the chickens are roasted in the <implement>tin-kitchen,</implement> before the fire, it will take a quarter of an hour longer than in the oven.</p>

The true fillet is the tenderloin, although sometimes one will see a rib roast, boned and rolled, called a fillet. A short fillet, weighing from two and a half to three pounds (the average weight from a very large rump), will suffice for ten persons at a dinner where this is served as one course; and if a larger quantity is wanted a great saving will still be made if two short fillets are used. They cost about two dollars, while a large one, weighing the same amount, would cost five dollars. <ingredient>Fillet of beef</ingredient> is one of the simplest, safest and most satisfactory dishes that a lady can prepare for either her own family or guests. After a single trial she will think no more of it than of broiling a beef steak. First, remove from the fillet, with a sharp knife, every shred of muscle, ligament and thin, tough skin. If it is not then of a good round shape, skewer it into shape. Draw a line through the centre, and <ingredient>lard</ingredient> with two rows of <ingredient>pork,</ingredient> having them meet at this line.

Make the <ingredient>force-meat</ingredient> as for <emph rend="italic">quenelles</emph> of chicken. Simmer two large <ingredient>chickens</ingredient> in <ingredient>white stock</ingredient> for half an hour. Take up, and let cool. Have a <ingredient>pickled tongue</ingredient> boiled tender. Cut thin slices from the breast of the chickens, and cut these in squares. Cut the tongue in slices, and these in turn in squares the same size as the chicken. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> a four-quart mould, and arrange the chicken and tongue handsomely on the bottom and sides, being careful to have the pieces fit closely together. Have note paper cut to fit the bottom and sides. Butter it well, and cover about an inch deep with the force-meat. Take up the bottom piece by the four corners and fit it into the mould, the meat side down. Pour a little hot <ingredient>water</ingredient> into any kind of a flat-bottomed tin basin, and put this in the mould and move it over the papers, to melt the butter; then lift out the paper. Place the papers on the side in the same way as on the bottom and melt the butter by rolling a bottle of hot water over them. Remove these papers, and set the mould in a cold place until the filling is ready. Cut from the tenderest part of the chicken enough meat to make two quarts. Cut four large, or six small, <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> and

<hd align="center" size="larger">SALADS.</hd>
<p>A salad should come to the table fresh and crisp. The garnishes should be of the lightest and freshest kind. Nothing is more out of place than a delicate salad covered with hard-boiled eggs, boiled beets, etc. A salad with which the mayonnaise dressing is used, should have only the delicate white leaves of the celery, or the small leaves from the heart of the lettuce, and these should be arranged in a wreath at the base, with a few tufts here and there on the salad. The contrast between the creamy dressing and the light green is not great, but it is pleasing. In arranging a salad on a dish, or in a bowl, handle it very lightly. Never use pressure to get it into form. When a jelly border is used with salads, some of it should be helped with the salad. The small round radishes may be arranged in the dish with a lettuce salad. In washing lettuce great care must be taken not to break or wilt it. The large, dark green leaves are not nice for salad. As lettuce is not an expensive vegetable, it is best, when the heads are not round and compact, to buy an extra one and throw the large tough leaves away. In winter and early spring, when lettuce is raised in hot-houses, it is liable to have insects on it. Care must be taken that all are washed off. Only the white, crisp parts of celery should be used in salads. The green, tough parts will answer for stews and soups. Vegetable salads can be served for tea and lunch and with, or after, the meats at dinner. The hot cabbage, red cabbage, celery, cucumber and potato salads, are particularly
 
<pb n="207" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=211"/>
appropriate for serving with meats. The lettuce salad, with the French dressing, and the dressed celery, are the best to serve after the meats. A rich salad, like chicken, lobster or salmon, is out of place at a company dinner. It is best served for suppers and lunches. The success of a salad (after the dressing is made) depends upon keeping the lettuce or celery crisp and not adding meat or dressing to it until the time for serving.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>All green vegetables must be washed thoroughly in cold water and dropped into water which has been salted and is just beginning to boil. There should be a table-spoonful of salt for every two quarts of water. If the water boils a long time before the vegetables are put in it loses all its gases, and the mineral ingredients are deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle, so that the water is flat and tasteless: the vegetables will not look green, nor have a fine flavor. The time of boiling green vegetables depends very much upon the age, and how long they have been gathered. The younger and more freshly gathered, the more quickly they are cooked. The following is a time-table for cooking:</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Potatoes.</hd>
<p>No other vegetable is in America so commonly used and abused. The most inexperienced housekeeper takes it as a matter of course that she or her cook cannot fail of boiling potatoes properly. The time of cooking the potato, unlike that of nearly all other vegetables, does not vary with age or freshness; so there need never be a failure. In baking, the heat of the oven is not always the same, and the time of cooking will vary accordingly. The potato is composed largely of starch. Cooking breaks the cells and sets this starch free. If the potato is removed from heat and moisture as soon as this occurs, it will be dry and mealy, but if it is allowed to boil or bake, even for a few minutes, the starch will absorb the moisture, and the potato will become soggy and have a poor flavor.</p>

Rinse a large bowl or pan with <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and then with cold. Half fill it with <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Wash the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in this, working it with the hands until it is light and waxy. This frees it of the salt and butter-milk, and lightens it, so that the pastry is more delicate. Shape the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into two thin cakes, and put in a pan of <ingredient>ice water,</ingredient> to harden. Mix the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> With the hands, rub one-third of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Add the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> stirring with a knife. Stir quickly and vigorously until the paste is a smooth ball. Sprinkle the board <emph rend="italic">lightly</emph> with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Turn the paste on this, and pound quickly and lightly with the rolling pin. Do not break the paste. Roll from you and to one side; or, if easier to roll from you all the while, turn the paste around. When it is about one-fourth of an inch thick, wipe the remaining <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> break it in bits, and spread these on the paste. Sprinkle lightly with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Fold the paste, one-third from each side, so that the edges meet. Now fold from the ends, but do not have these meet.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Directions for Freezing.</purpose>
Pour the mixture that is to be frozen into the tin can, put the beater in this, and put on the cover. Place in the tub, being careful to have the point on the bottom fit into the socket in the tub. Put on the cross-piece, and turn the crank to see if everything is in the right place.</p>
<p>Next comes the packing. <ingredient>Ice</ingredient> should be broken in large pieces, and put in a canvas bag, and pounded fine with a mallet. Put a thick layer of it in the tub (about five inches deep), and then a thin layer of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Continue this until the tub is full, and pack down solid with a paddle or a common piece of wood. After turning the crank a few times add more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice, and again pack down. Continue in this way until the tub is full. For a gallon can, three pints of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and perhaps ten quarts of fine ice will be required. Remember that if the freezer is packed solid at first, no more ice or <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is needed. The water must never be let off, as it is one of the strongest elements to help the freezing. If more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> than the quantity given is used, the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> will freeze sooner, but it will not be so smooth and rich as when less is used.</p>
<p>Turn the crank for twenty minutes--not fast at first, but very rapidly the last ten minutes. It will be hard to turn when the mixture is frozen. Turn back the cross-piece, wipe the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and ice from the cover, and take off the cover, not displacing the can itself. Remove the beater and scrape the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from it. Work a large spoon up and down in the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> until it is light and the space left by taking out the beater is filled. Cover the can, cork up the hole from which the handle of the beater was taken, put on the cross piece, and set the tub in a cool place until serving time. Then dip

the can for a few seconds in <ingredient>water</ingredient> that is a trifle warm, wipe it, and turn on the dish. Rest it for a moment, and lift a little.</p>
<p>If the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is to be served from a mould, remove it when you do the beater. Fill the mould and work the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> up and down with a spoon. This will press the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> into every part, and lighten it. Cover the top of the mould with thick white paper, put on the tin cover, and bury in fresh ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>
<p>There are a great many good freezers. The Packer is especially suited to family use. It turns so easily that any lady can make her own creams. For the first twelve minutes a child can work it. It is made of the best stock, and will last many years. The cogs on freezers should be oiled occasionally. When you have made <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> see that every part of the freezer is clean and perfectly dry before putting away.</p>

In the little town of Richmond, England, is a small pastry shop widely known for its cheese cakes. It is said that the original recipe for them was furnished by a maid of Queen Elizabeth, who had a palace at Richmond. In the neighboring city of London the cakes are in great demand, and the popular opinion there is that the only place to get them is the shop mentioned, where they are made somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>One cupful of <ingredient>sweet milk, one of sour,</ingredient> one of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> a <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> the <ingredient>yolks of four eggs,</ingredient> a speck of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Put all the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> in the <implement>double boiler</implement> and cook until it curds; then strain.

Make a <ingredient>paste</ingredient> the same as for <emph rend="italic">&#233;clairs.</emph> <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> three <implement>pie plates.</implement> Roll <ingredient>puff or chopped paste</ingredient> very thin, and cover the plates with it. Cut off the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> about an inch from the edge all round the plates. Spread a thin layer of the cooked <ingredient>paste</ingredient> over the <ingredient>puff paste.</ingredient> Put a tube, measuring about half an inch in diameter, in a pastry bag. Turn the remainder of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> into the bag and press it through the tube on to the edges of the plates, where the <ingredient>puff paste</ingredient> has been cut off. Care must be taken to have the border of equal thickness all round the plates. With a fork, prick holes in the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in the centre of the plate. Bake half an hour in a moderate oven. When the plates have been put in the oven, make what <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is left in the bag into balls about half the size of an American walnut. There will be enough for three dozen. Drop them into a pan that has been buttered lightly, and bake fifteen or twenty minutes. While they are baking, put half a cupful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and half a cupful of <ingredient>granulated sugar</ingredient> in a small sauce-pan, and boil twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>When the little balls and the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in the plate is done, take the balls on the point of a <implement>skewer</implement> or large needle, dip them in the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> and place them on the border of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> (the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> will hold them), about two inches apart. A word of caution just here: Do not stir the <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> as that will make it grain, and, of course, spoil it. A good plan is to pour part of the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> into a small cup, which place in hot <ingredient>water.</ingredient> That remaining in the sauce-pan should be kept hot, but it
 
<pb n="315" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=319"/>
should not boil, until needed. When all the balls have been used, dip four dozen <ingredient>French candied cherries</ingredient> in the <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> and stick them between the balls. Reserve about fifteen <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> with which to garnish the centre of the cake.</p>
<p>Whip one pint and a half of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to a froth. Soak half a package of <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> in half a cupful of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> for two hours. Pour on this half a cupful of boiling <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Place the pan of <ingredient>whipped cream</ingredient> in another of <ingredient>ice water,</ingredient> and sprinkle over it two-thirds of a cupful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and nearly a teaspoonful of <ingredient>vanilla flavor.</ingredient> Strain the gelatine on this, and stir gently from the bottom until it begins to thicken. When it will just pour, fill the three plates with it, and set them in the <implement>ice chest</implement> for half an hour. Garnish the top with the remaining <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> and serve. This is an excellent dish for dessert or party suppers.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">PRESERVING.</hd>
<p>In using self-sealing glass jars great care must be taken. If the work is properly done the fruit can be kept for years. Have a kettle of hot water on the stove beside the <implement>preserving kettle,</implement> and also a small dipper of hot water. Plunge a jar into the hot water, having the water strike both inside and outside the jar at the same time. If you set it down instead of plunging it, it will break. Put the cover in the <implement>dipper.</implement> When the jar is hot, lift it up and pour the water from it into the kettle. Stand the jar in the hot water and fill it with hot fruit from the <implement>preserving kettle.</implement> Fill to the brim with the hot syrup. Take the cover from the dipper of hot water and screw it on very tightly. In using the jars a second time have the right cover and band for each one. A large-mouthed <implement>tunnel,</implement> such as grocers have, is almost indispensible in the work of preserving.</p>
<p>Jellies and jams should be put in <implement>tumblers</implement> or bowls. A paper should be cut to fit the top, and then wet in brandy, and another paper should be pasted over it. <implement>Jelly tumblers</implement> with glass covers are more convenient than the old-fashioned ones, and where they are used the second paper cover is not necessary. It is better not to cover until some weeks after the jelly is made. White crushed sugar is much the nicest for preserving. If jelly does not seem hard, as it should be the day after it is made, it can be set in the sun for several hours, which will help it greatly.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">POTTING.</hd>
<p>For potting, one should have small stone or earthen jars, a little larger at the top than at the bottom, so that the meat may be taken out whole, and then cut in thin slices. All kinds of cooked meats and fish can be potted. The meat must, of course, be well cooked and tender, so that it can be readily pounded to a paste. Of the fish, salmon and halibut are the best for potting. When the potted meat or fish is to be served, scrape off all the butter, run a knife between the meat and the jar, and, when the meat is loosened, turn it out on a dish. Cut it in thin slices, and garnish with parsley; or, serve it whole, and slice it at the table. The butter that covered meats can be used for basting roasted meats, and that which covered fish can be used for basting baking fish.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Omelets.</hd>
<p>There is no better form in which to serve eggs than as an omelet, but so few people make a good omelet that that is one of the last things the inexperienced housekeeper or cook will attempt. Yet the making is a simple operation, the cause of failure usually being that the pan for cooking is not hot enough, and too much egg is put in at one time. When there is too much egg in the pan, one part will be cooked hard before the other is heated through. A pan measuring eight inches in diameter will cook an omelet made with four eggs; if more eggs are used, a larger pan is necessary.</p>

<hd align="center" placement="heading">BREAD.</hd>
<p>When you put the bread on the board, pat it lightly. Do not <emph rend="italic">press down,</emph> but let all motions be as elastic as possible. Knead with the <emph rend="italic">palm</emph> until the dough is a flat cake, and then fold. Keep doing this until the dough is light and smooth and will not stick to the board or hands. Use as little flour as possible in kneading. Do not stop until you have fully finished, for bread that has "rested" is not good. Milk can be used instead of water in mixing. It should always be first scalded, and then allowed to cool to blood heat. One table-spoonful of lard or butter makes the bread tenderer when water is used.</p>
<p>In cold weather some kitchens grow cold very quickly after the fire is out. In this case the bread should be made earlier in the evening, and set in a warmer place (about eighty or ninety degrees); because if it begins to rise within the first two hours, it will continue to rise, unless the temperature falls to the freezing point. The reason for letting the rolls rise longer than the loaves is, that the former, being smaller, are penetrated by heat much more quickly than the loaves are, and, of course, fermentation is stopped sooner; therefore, the rolls do not rise as much in the oven as the loaves.</p>
<p>Rolls should be made into smooth little balls, and should be placed in even rows in a shallow pan. Breakfast rolls are first made into little balls and then rolled between the hands until three inches long. They are placed close together
 
<pb n="381" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=385"/>
in even rows in the pan. Dinner and French rolls, after being made into little balls, are put on a well-floured board, and a little, well-floured rolling-pin, two and a half inches in diameter, is pressed nearly through their centre. The rolls are to be so placed in pans as not to touch each other. Being so small, and baking so quickly, they have a sweet taste of the wheat.</p>
<p>The best-sized pan for loaves is made of block tin; is eight and a half inches long, four and a half wide, and three deep. Those for wheat bread should be greased very slightly with either butter or lard. For rye, Indian, or Graham, they must be greased thoroughly, as the dough clings more to the tins. There are many kinds of bread that can be made readily and safely after once learning to make good common bread. It is difficult to give exact rules for flour, as it varies, some kinds requiring much more water than others. The "new process" flour has so much more starch, and packs so much more closely than the "old process," that one-eighth less is required, or one-eighth more of liquid; but if the flour is weighed, the same amount of water is taken for a pound of flour made by either process. The best flour is always the cheapest for bread. As there is no one article of food of so great importance for the health and happiness of the family as bread, make it as nearly perfect as possible.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Yeast.</purpose>
Put two quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and two table-spoonfuls of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> on to boil. Pare and grate six large <ingredient>potatoes.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>hops</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">boil,</emph> strain the <ingredient>water</ingredient> on the grated <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> and stir well. Place on the stove and boil up once. Add half a cupful of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and one-fourth of a cupful of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> Let the mixture get blood warm; then add one cupful of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> or one cake of <ingredient>compressed yeast,</ingredient> and let it rise in a
 
<pb n="382" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=386"/>
warm place five or six hours. When well risen, turn into a stone jug. Cork this tightly, and set in a cool place.</p>
<p>As poor yeast is the chief cause of poor bread, pains should be taken to make <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> properly and to keep it well. It must never be allowed to stand in a warm room after it has risen, and the jug in which it is kept should be carefully washed and <emph rend="italic">scalded</emph> each time the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is renewed. As much care must be taken with the stopper as with the jug.</p>
<p>When it is convenient to get fresh cakes of Fleischmann's compressed yeast, it will be much better and cheaper to use them than to make your own. This <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is wholly free of any injurious substance, and with it good bread can always be made, provided the flour is good and the rules are followed.</p>

Put back in the pan. Hold the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> in the hand long enough to have it very soft. Rub it over the dough. Cover closely, that neither dust nor air can get in, and set in a warm place. It will rise in eight or nine hours. In the morning shape into loaves or rolls. If into loaves, let these rise an hour where the temperature is between ninety and one hundred degrees; if into rolls, let these rise an hour and a half.

The loaves will need from forty-five to sixty minutes to bake, but the rolls will be done in half an hour if placed close together in the pan; and if French rolls are made, they will bake in fifteen minutes. As soon as baked, the bread should be taken out of the pans and placed on a table where it can rest against something until cool.

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Cocoa.</hd>
<p>Cocoa is rich in nutritive elements. Like milk, it has all the substances necessary for the growth and sustenance of the body. It is the fruit of a small tree that grows in Mexico, Central America, the West Indies and other islands. The fruit is in shape like a large, thick cucumber, and contains from six to thirty beans. There is a number of forms in which it is sold in the market, the most convenient and nutritious being chocolate. Next comes cocoa, then cocoa nibs, and lastly cocoa shells. The beans of the cocoa are roasted in the same manner as coffee. The husks or shells are taken off and the beans then ground between hot rollers. Sometimes the husks are not removed, but ground with the bean. The ground bean is called cocoa; and mixed with sugar, after being ground very fine, is termed chocolate. Vanilla is often added as a flavor. Sometimes the cocoa is mixed with starch. When the bean is broken in small pieces, these are called nibs.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">Coffee.</hd>
<p>There is a variety of coffees; but, unlike the teas, they do not owe their difference of flavor or color to the curing, but to the soil and climate in which they grow. Coffee grows on small trees. The fruit is something like the cherry, but there are two seeds in it. The beans are separated by being bruised with a heavy roller, and are then washed and dried. The longer the raw berry is kept the riper and better flavored it becomes. In countries where coffee is grown the leaves are used as much as the berry. Like tea, coffee must be roasted, that the fine flavor shall be developed. There are large establishments for roasting and grinding coffee. The work is done by machinery; and nearly always the grains are evenly roasted, and just enough to give the right flavor. If the coffee, after roasting, is put in close tin
 
<pb n="388" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=392"/>
cans, it will retain its best qualities for a long time. It can be ground when needed for use. Many persons think that heating the dry coffee just before making improves the flavor. There are many modes of making coffee, each having its advantages and disadvantages. Some people think that by first wetting the coffee with cold water, and letting it come to a boil, and by then adding the boiling water, more of the strength of the coffee is extracted. When there is not cream for coffee the milk should be boiled, as it makes the coffee richer. As soon as the milk boils up it should be taken off of the stove, since it grows strong and oily by much boiling. To many people it is injurious to drink coffee; but physicians say that, taken without milk, it is harmless. Some element of the coffee combines with the milk to form a leathery coating on the stomach, which impairs digestion. A great many substances are mixed with coffee, when sold, to cheapen it,--chicory, beans, peas, rye, and wheat being the commonest. To obtain it pure, the safest way is to buy it unground, unless you purchase of a strictly honest dealer. Coffee drinkers, as a rule, eat less than other people, though coffee, and also tea, have little direct food value; but they retard the waste of the tissues, and so take the place of food. The sugar and milk used with them give some nutriment.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Boiled Coffee.</purpose>
The old method of boiling <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is still practised by at least one-half the housekeepers in this country. The <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is sometimes boiled with an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> which makes it perfectly clear, and also enriches it. When an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> is not used a small piece of <ingredient>salt fish skin</ingredient> is boiled with the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> to clear it.</p>
<p>Directions for making: A small cupful of roasted and ground <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> one-third <ingredient>Mocha</ingredient> and two-thirds <ingredient>Java;</ingredient> a
 
<pb n="389" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=393"/>
small <ingredient>egg, shell and all,</ingredient> broken into the pot with the dry <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient> Stir well with a spoon, and then pour on three pints of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> Let it boil from five to ten minutes, counting from the time it begins to boil. As soon as it has boiled enough, pour in a cupful of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and turn a little of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> into a cup, to see that the nozzle of the pot is not filled with grounds. Turn this back, and let the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> stand a few moments to settle, taking care that it does not boil again. The advantages of boiled <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> are that when the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> is used the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> gives a very rich flavor, and when the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is added the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> has a rich, yellow look, which is pleasing. It has also a peculiar flavor, which many people prefer to the flavor gained by any other process. The disadvantages are that the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> coats the dry <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> and when the hot <ingredient>water</ingredient> is added the coating becomes hard, and a great deal of the best of the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> remains in the grounds after boiling. Also, in boiling, much of the fine flavor is lost in the steam that escapes from the pot.</p>

<recipe class1="beverages" class2="medhealth">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading">Filtered Coffee.</purpose>
Another--and really the most economical and the easiest--way of making <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is by filtering. The <implement>French coffee biggin</implement> is valuable for this. It consists of two cylindrical tin vessels, one fitting into another, and the bottom of the upper being a fine strainer. Another coarser strainer, with a rod running from the centre, is placed upoon this. Then the <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> which must be finely-ground, is put in, and another strainer is placed at the top of the rod. The <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> is poured on, and the pot set where it will keep hot, but not boil, until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> has gone through. This will make a clear, strong <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> with a rich, smooth flavor. The advantage of the two extra strainers is that the one coming next to the fine strainer prevents the grounds from filling up the fine holes, and so the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is clear, and made more easily. The
 
<pb n="390" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=394"/>
upper strainer causes the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to fall on the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> like rain. In this way it is more evenly distributed, and the fine <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is not carried through the fine strainer, as it would be if the <ingredient>water</ingredient> were poured directly on the dry <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient> When <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is added to filtered <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> it does not turn a rich yellow, as in the case of that boiled with an egg. <variation>A few spoonfuls of this <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> without sugar or milk, taken after dinner, is said <purpose>to help digestion.</purpose></variation></p>

There are two modes of frying. One is to have just enough <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to prevent the article from burning or sticking; and the other is to have enough not only to cover the food, but to float it. The latter is by far the better way, as all the surface of the article is instantly hardened, and, therefore, will not absorb <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> It is also the cheaper way, because the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> can be used so many times. If the <ingredient>drippings saved from meats, soups and gravies</ingredient> should not be enough for frying purposes, buy pure <ingredient>lard</ingredient> to use with it. Many recommend buying <ingredient>beef suet</ingredient> for this same purpose; but food fried in <ingredient>suet</ingredient> is more liable to absorb <ingredient>fat</ingredient> than that fried in <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The
 
<pb n="399" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=403"/>
reason of this is that <ingredient>lard</ingredient> can be heated to a higher temperature without burning than can <ingredient>beef</ingredient> or any of the other fats. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> is also often recommended for frying. If used, it should be free of salt. But aside from being so expensive, it is not so nice for frying purposes as fats, for it burns at a much lower temperature than either <ingredient>beef fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard.</ingredient> The <implement>Scotch kettle</implement> is the <emph rend="italic">best</emph> utensil for frying. It rests on a rim, which lifts the bottom from the stove, and the inside surface is polished very smooth; therefore, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is less liable to burn than if the surface were rough and the bottom rested on the hot stove. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should heat gradually; and when the food is plunged into it a slight smoke should rise from the <emph rend="italic">centre.</emph> It will smoke at the sides some time before it has become hot enough for frying. After the food has been put in, let the kettle stand on the hottest part of the stove until it regains its former temperature, and then set it back where it is not quite so hot. In frying <ingredient>fish-balls,</ingredient> <ingredient>doughnuts,</ingredient> etc., put only a few at a time in the boiling <ingredient>fat;</ingredient> then wait a few moments for the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to regain its former temperature, and put in a few more. <ingredient>Fish-balls</ingredient> are often spoiled by the putting of a great many in the kettle at once. The temperature of the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is instantly reduced, and the balls absorb the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> When an article of food is fried, drain the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from it, and lay it on a sheet of brown paper in a warm pan. The paper will absorb any <ingredient>fat</ingredient> that may remain on the food. As soon as you are through frying, take the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the fire, and when cooled a little, strain it. (See the chapter on the Care of Food.) If the directions given are followed, there will be no difficulty in having food fried without its being saturated with grease.</p>

<p>It is a great improvement to have the sauce poured around the article instead of over it, and to have the border of the dish garnished with bits of parsley, celery tops or carrot leaves.</p>
<p>When sauce is poured around meat or fish the dish must be quite hot, or the sauce will cool quickly.</p>
<p>Small rolls or sticks of bread are served with soup. Potatoes and bread are usually served with fish, but many people prefer to serve only bread. Butter is not served at the more elegant dinners. Two vegetables will be sufficient in any course. Cold dishes should be very cold, and hot dishes <emph rend="italic">hot.</emph></p>
<p>It is a good idea to have a dish of sliced lemons for any kind of fish, and especially for those broiled or fried.</p>
<p>Melons, cantelopes, cucumbers and radishes, and tomatoes, when served in slices, should all be chilled in the <implement>ice chest.</implement></p>
<p>Be particular not to overdo the work of decorating. Even a simple garnish adds much to the appearance of a dish, but too much decoration only injures it. Garnishes should be so arranged as not to interfere with serving.</p>
<p>Potato-balls and thin fried potatoes make a nice garnish for all kinds of fried and broiled meats and fish.</p>
<p>Cold boiled beets, carrots and turnips, and the whites of hard-boiled eggs, stamped out with a fancy <implement>vegetable cutter,</implement> make a pretty garnish for cold or hot meats.</p>
<p>Thin slices of toast, cut into triangles, make a good garnish for many dishes.</p>
<p>Whipped cream is a delicate garnish for all Bavarian creams, blanc-manges, frozen puddings and ice creams.</p>

<p>Arrange around jellies or creams a border of any kind of delicate green, like smilax or parsley, or of rose leaves, and dot it with bright colors--pinks, geraniums, verbenas or roses. Remember that the green should be dark and the flowers small and bright. A bunch of artificial rose leaves, for decorating dishes of fruit at evening parties, lasts for years. Natural leaves are preferable when they can be obtained.</p>
<p>Wild roses, buttercups and nasturtiums, if not used too freely, are suitable for garnishing a salad.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger">BILLS OF FARE.</hd>
<p>What to set before guests at the table, or, indeed, before one's own family, is sometimes a perplexing matter for housekeepers to decide, and a few bills of fare are given on the following pages as an aid. The number of dishes can readily be increased or diminished. Any of the company dinners can be prepared at home almost as easily as an ordinary dinner, success depending not upon a great number of dishes, but upon a few well cooked and well served, and a hostess apparently free from care.</p>
<p>A great part of any company dinner can be prepared the day before. The vegetables can be prepared and put in cold water, the game or meat be larded, the meat or fish cooked for croquettes and salads, the salad dressing made ready, and jellies, creams and cold puddings be made. If a clear soup (and that is always best) is to be served, it also should be made. In the morning the bread and cake can be baked, and the fish and other dishes prepared. Early in the afternoon freeze the creams and sherbets.</p>
<p>Make a list of the principal dishes. With each dish have a list of the vegetables, sauces or other things to be served, and the time for serving. This will insure the dishes being ready at the proper moment. Have the plates and other dishes counted and ready to warm--and, by the way, arrange to have these and the silver washed where the noise cannot reach the guests.</p>
 
<pb n="403" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=miss&#38;PageNum=407"/>
<p>Twelve seems to be a good number of people for a dinner party. But very little increase in the quantity of material will be required if the number should be as large as sixteen or eighteen. For six or eight the quantity of soup, oysters, creams, sherbets and coffee, can be diminished one-third, but that of meats and fish should not be much smaller. It is supposed that the coffee will be served in small cups. Although it is usually drunk clear, cream and sugar should be offered with it.</p>
<p>People differ as to the kinds of breakfast required. Many believe in the French custom of having only chocolate or coffee, rolls, and perhaps eggs in some form. Again, others believe in and require and substantial breakfast. There is no limit to the variety of dishes that can be prepared for breakfast and tea if the cook has taste and judgment in using the remains of meats, fish and vegetables left from dinner. Either oatmeal or hominy should always be served at breakfast. When it is possible, have fruit for the first course.</p>
