<hd align="center">PREFACE.</hd>
<p>IN submitting this book to the public, the author carries out a long-cherished purpose, which had its inception in a suggestion made to her by the Hon. John Eaton, United-States Commissioner of Education, during a discussion concerning the cookery of America. The fact that the cookery of Europe, and especially of France, enters so largely into the author's scheme of teaching, and of constructing her books already published, was being commented upon; and in response to her statement that this was occasioned by the demands of the public, and not from any lack of variety or excellence in American cookery, the commissioner suggested the preparation of a work sufficiently broad in scope and minute in detail to verify her assertion that genuine American cookery is both wholesome and palatable, and has lost none of the traditional excellence which characterized it in our grandmothers' days.</p>
<p>To facilitate the work, the commissioner caused the publication and extended circulation of the following correspondence:--</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">To the</emph> HON. JOHN EATON, <emph rend="italic">U.S. Commissioner of Education, Bureau of Education, Dept. of the Interior, Washington, D.C.</emph></p>
<p>DEAR SIR,--I venture to ask your help in an educational matter of general public interest, and trust you will afford me such assistance as lies in your power.</p>
<p>I have been, as you are aware, engaged for the past four years in the training of young women and girls in domestic economy, numbering among my pupils many ladies of our most prominent families. The results of this instruction have so successfully covered the local field of cookery in the North- 
 
<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=14"/>

eastern States, that I am in receipt of many communications urging me to adapt some of my special methods to the Southern and Western portions of the country. In consequence of marked social changes attendant on the civil war, a radical alteration is taking place in this department. In doing this work, I desire to combine rudimentary economical principles with the culinary excellence of local dishes. In order to proceed intelligently, I must depend largely on the kindness of persons best informed in regard to the specialties of the local market supply, and of such dishes as hold popular favor.</p>
<p>In connection with this subject I venture to apply to you. Will you please aid me in communicating with these persons, in order, (1) that I may consult them in regard to the desirableness of establishing cooking-schools, and (2) that I may ask them for information concerning the following points:--</p>
<list align="indent1"><item>1. Definite lists of the principal foods in local use, and their average market prices.</item>
<item>2. Accurate recipes for the preparation of such materials in popular dishes.</item>
<item>3. Recipes for favorite local dishes, and their names.</item>
<item>4. General information bearing on the subject.</item>
</list>
<p>I shall consider such information of the greatest value to me in the preparation of the work I propose to issue, not for the use of families only, but also for the guidance of instructors in cooking in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>With assurances of high esteem, I am </p>
<p align="indent1">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Respectfully yours,</p>
<p align="indent2">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;JULIET CORSON,</p>
<p align="right">Superintendent New-York School of Cookery.</p>
<p>OFFICE OF THE NEW-YORK SCHOOL OF COOKERY,</p>
<p align="indent2">UNION SQUARE, NEW YORK, Aug. 1878.</p>
<p>Upon the receipt of Miss Corson's letter, Gen. Eaton caused the following circular letter to be issued from the Bureau of Education, and generally circulated throughout the country; addressing it to the heads of educational institutions, and to all persons of local prominence who seemed likely to be able to supply the information called for by Miss Corson:--</p>
<p>SIR,--I beg to call your attention to the enclosed copy of a letter received from Miss Juliet Corson, the superintendent of the New-York School of Cookery. I hope you may be able to make some valuable suggestions for her on one or more topics of special importance to her work.</p>
<p>Miss Corson's ability, culture, wisdom in forming and executing her plans, her eminent qualifications in the theory and practice of cooking, and her success in organizing and conducting the school in New-York City and in preparing manuals upon the subject of cooking, give the best possible assurance 
 
<pb n="vii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=15"/>

that whatever information you can afford her upon points of her inquiry will be advantageously used.</p>
<p>Any suggestions you may make for her use can be sent to this office in the enclosed envelope, and will be forwarded to her.</p>
<p align="indent2">&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Very respectfully yours,</p>
<p align="right">JOHN EATON, Commissioner,<lb/>Per C. W.</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF EDUCATION,</p>
<p align="indent2">WASHINGTON, D.C., Aug. 31, 1878.</p>
<p>The material which came in response to this correspondence was abundant. The author has augmented it in the spring and fall lecture and lesson tours she has taken to many parts of the country during the intervening years; she has also availed herself of recipes communicated to her by personal friends, and drawn from local and private collections. Like every person absorbed in the advancement of a special line of work, she has appropriated every hint offered her: the only personal credit to which she is entitled is for the scrupulous fidelity with which she has tested the methods given, and verified every statement which she makes. If the directions seem verbose, the fact must be remembered that the greater number of cookery-books fail to meet the demands of housewives, because they are indefinite; and they are especially trying to those who have yet to gain the judgment and experience which too many writers on domestic subjects seem to take for granted. The author aims, above all, to be clear and precise; to give such simple methods that a person of the most ordinary intelligence can follow them. She guarantees that the promised results will always be attained if the directions are closely adhered to; the only latitude allowed is in the matter of seasoning, which is left more or less to the judgment of the cook, who must be guided by the taste of those for whom she caters. And in regard to the use of wine, in this last question, the author suggests that where the use of wine is not desirable, some dish should be chosen into the composition of which it does not enter; because, unless it is so definitely stated in the recipe, there is no flavoring or seasoning which can replace it without altering the character of the dish. There are many delicious dishes which require no wine,--so many, indeed, that the author has repeatedly offered to supply to any

temperance society which would publish it, a good Temperance Cookery-Book, the use of which would do much to advance the cause whose advocates urge her to espouse it, forgetting that, as a teacher of cookery, she is not at liberty to accept or reject any available edible substance because of personal preference or disapproval. Of the engravings, some are original; the rest are copied from the works of the best European writers on cookery.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the author begs a cordial reception for this book in the name of the Forest City Housewife and her sister host of culinary experts whose best knowledge and perfected experience it embodies.</p>
<p>NEW YORK, 1886.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE KITCHEN.</purpose>

THE fitting-up and care of the kitchen have been so often treated by writers upon domestic matters, that comparatively little space need be given to the subject here; only a few outlines which every housekeeper can fill by the exercise of her own taste and judgment. If possible, have the kitchen upon the level of the ground; or, if it must be in the basement of a house, take care that plenty of light and air reach it. If daylight does not flood every corner of it, supply artificial light, even in the daytime; for no domestic operation requires more light than the treatment of food. Painting the wood-work and floor a light color is of use in this particular. In some of the modern houses where there are elevators, the kitchen and laundry are placed in the top story, greatly to the comfort of all the inmates of the house, who thus escape all odors of cooking and washing.</p>
<p>Equally with light is cleanliness important in the kitchen. The cleaning of floors is considered in the chapter on The Dining-room. The walls of a kitchen should be of some hard finish, either panelled wood, tiles, or plastering which can be covered with whitewash or kalsomine coloring.</p>
 
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=32"/>

<p>Any <ingredient>lime</ingredient> wash is desirable for the kitchen, because it tends to keep the air pure if frequently applied. The following will be found excellent: Half fill a large pail with <ingredient>quick-lime;</ingredient> pour upon it one gallon of <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and stir it until ebullition ceases; then stir in one pint of <ingredient>linseed-oil,</ingredient> and add enough more <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to make the wash of the consistency of thin paste. <ingredient>Copperas-water</ingredient> used in place of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> will make the wash disinfectant to a certain degree. The use of <ingredient>skim-milk</ingredient> instead of the first <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> will make a wash which will resist the action of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Apply the wash with a broad flat brush, moving it up and down the walls with even strokes. The so-called <ingredient>White House wash</ingredient> is made by slacking half a bushel of quicklime with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> keeping it covered until ebullition ceases; meantime a peck of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is dissolved in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and three pounds of ground <ingredient>rice</ingredient> are made into a thin <ingredient>paste</ingredient> by boiling it with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> a pound of <ingredient>clean glue</ingredient> is dissolved in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> at the same time, and half a pound of <ingredient>Spanish whiting</ingredient> is powdered; all these ingredients are mixed together, with the addition of enough <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to make the mixture properly liquid, and it is then strained, cooled, and allowed to stand three days in a covered vessel. When the wash is required for use, it is heated in a <implement>double kettle,</implement> and applied hot with a flat brush. This wash resists the action of severe weather, and will serve in place of paint for walls, or wood or stone work. It may be used for the kitchen woodwork if desired.</p>
<p>If the kitchen is already painted, and only needs cleaning, use <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and <ingredient>soap</ingredient> with a <implement>flannel rag</implement>. The addition of a handful of <ingredient>borax</ingredient> or four tablespoonfuls of liquid <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> to a gallon of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> will make a solution which will clean paint and glass quickly and well without <ingredient>soap.</ingredient> Wash oil>-cloths by first rubbing them over with a cloth wet in equal parts of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and then with another wet in warm 
 
<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=33"/>

<ingredient>water,</ingredient> and finally with a soft dry cloth; wet only a small place at once, and never use a brush if it can be avoided. Keep <implement>oilcloths</implement> clean ordinarily by wiping them first with a damp cloth and then with a dry one; but do not apply <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> or use a harsh brush or a mop. When the paint has been scrubbed off <implement>oilcloths,</implement> and their texture is still unbroken, they can be restored by having a coat of good <ingredient>oil paint</ingredient> laid over them about once a year. Some durable bright color is preferable; and the effect can be heightened by having a solid color for the centre, and a contrasting hue for the border. Rubbing with a few drops of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> on a damp cloth, and subsequent polishing with dry cloth, will clean windows easily and well. Kitchen-tables should be cleaned every day, with <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in which either borax or <ingredient>washing-soda</ingredient> is dissolved. The sink should be flushed every day with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and a handful of <ingredient>washing-soda</ingredient> thrown upon the strainer over the drain-pipe before the greasy <ingredient>water</ingredient> is poured down it after a meal is over. If this point is attended to, and no scraps of refuse or grounds of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> or <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> are allowed to pass into the drain-pipe, housekeepers will escape that troublesome and expensive plumber's job of cutting out the drain-pipe. Every week in winter, and oftener in summer, a cupful of quicklime or of <ingredient>chloride of lime,</ingredient> or a pailful of hot <ingredient>copperas-water,</ingredient> should be thrown upon the drain. Copperas-<ingredient>water</ingredient> is a valuable disinfectant, free from the objectionable odor and physical effect of <ingredient>lime;</ingredient> it is made by placing the <ingredient>copperas</ingredient> in the bottom of a barrel, and covering it with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> enough <ingredient>copperas</ingredient> should be used to be plainly seen always upon the bottom of the barrel. The <ingredient>water,</ingredient> heated and poured in drains, sinks, and water-closets, by the pailful, once or twice a week, will keep them entirely free from dangerous emanations: note this when there is a closet upon the lower floor, or near the kitchen.</p>
 
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=34"/>

<p>After every meal the towels and dish-cloths should be washed in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> with <ingredient>soap</ingredient> and a little borax, and they should then be well rinsed and dried in the sun or air before using them again. Directions are given elsewhere for washing dishes.</p>
<p>If kitchen utensils are tarnished and discolored, put them into a large <implement>boiler</implement> containing <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and a handful of <ingredient>washing-soda,</ingredient> and let them boil for a few moments; then scour them with any of the good kitchen <ingredient>soaps</ingredient> made of fine <ingredient>white silicious</ingredient> matter. Very fine <ingredient>ashes,</ingredient> sand, or brick-dust sifted, will answer for scouring iron or copper. For tin and japanned or enamelled ware, use powdered <ingredient>whiting,</ingredient> applying it with a wet cloth, and then polishing with a dry one or with chamois. Knives are cleaned with powdered bath-brick.</p>
<p>To clean the stove, first wash it with <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda</ingredient> after it is cold, if it is greasy; and then blacken it with any good stove-polish,according to the directions accompanying the polish, and rub the steel fittings of the stove with emery-paper. To build a fire, first let down the grate, and take up the <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> and cinders carefully to avoid raising a dust, sifting the cinders to use in building the fire; brush the <ingredient>soot</ingredient> and dust out of the upper part of the stove, and from the flues which can be reached; be sure that all parts of the ovens and hot-boxes are clean; if there is a waterback attached to the stove, see that it is filled with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> if it is connected with water-pipes, be sure in winter that they are not frozen; brush up the hearth-stone. Lay the fire as follows: Put a few handfuls of dry shavings or paper in the bottom of the grate; upon them, some small sticks of pine wood laid across each other; then a few larger sticks, and some cinders free from <ingredient>ashes;</ingredient> a few small lumps of <ingredient>coke</ingredient> or <ingredient>coal</ingredient> may be mixed with the cinders. Open all the draughts of the stove, close all the covers, and light the 
 
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=35"/>

fire; when the cinders are lighted, add fresh coke and <ingredient>coal</ingredient> gradually and repeatedly until a clear, bright fire is started; then partly close the draughts. To keep up a fire, add fuel often, a little at once, in order not to check the heat: letting the fire burn low, and then replenishing it abundantly, is a wasteful method, because the stove grows so cold that most of the fresh heat is lost in raising the temperature again to the degree necessary for cooking. Removing the covers of the stove, to place a utensil nearer the fire, lowers the heat of the entire surface, and affects the temperature of the ovens; therefore flat-bottomed cooking-utensils are the best, for they fit close upon the covered top of the stove. Black iron saucepans cook more quickly than bright tin ones; coppers retain the heat, even when brightly polished, longer than any other metal, and are much the most durable. All these points of excellence are treated in detail in the author's "Cooking-school Text-book," to which the reader who desires further information is referred. When the fuel used is wood, the fire should be built and managed much in the same way. Hard wood is preferable to pine for cooking-purposes. <ingredient>Charcoal</ingredient> is a good cooking-fuel, but it is generally expensive.</p>
<p>All the kitchen refuse should be burned, first draining it from the slops; and then, when there is no cooking going on, it should be put upon the back of the fire, and all the draughts thrown open so that it can be quickly and entirely consumed. If there is no accumulation of rubbish in the kitchen, there will probably be no more croton-bugs or roaches than can be destroyed by the persistent use of powdered borax and insect-powder.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE PANTRY.</purpose>

Although cleanliness in the kitchen is generally enforced in well-regulated households, the same care is not always<pb n="6" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=36"/>

extended to those necessary repositories of food, the pantry, the refrigerator, and the cellar. The drains too often contaminate the latter, all kinds of food are gathered indiscriminately in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> and the pantry has too many dark corners. Then, again, the pantry is too often located so near the kitchen as to receive more or less heat from that room. This access of heat should be guarded against as far as possible, because it so interferes with the preservation of food. When it is impossible to have the pantry or store-room a little removed from the kitchen, the two rooms can be separated by double doors, or at least by a door furnished with a spring which will always close it.</p>
<p>The pantry should be so placed as to receive plenty of light and air to keep it free from dampness, but it should not be so exposed to the sun as to make it hot enough at any season to affect its contents. If there is not a storeroom proper,a large light closet should be devoted to its uses. Shelves should be arranged around the walls, those upon two sides at least permitting barrels to be placed under them; hooks should be placed upon the edges of some of the upper shelves, within easy reach, for the hanging of bunches of <ingredient>herbs</ingredient> and small bags, or nets containing <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> A cool, dark section should be set apart for <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> and <ingredient>jellies;</ingredient> and, if they are put up in stone jars or buckets, they should be labelled, so that the contents can be known without opening them. The arrangement of shelves, boxes, jars, and barrels will suggest itself to any tidy person, as it affords the easiest access to their contents. As far as possible, solid cases should be used for stores of all kinds, because paper used for wrapping them is so readily torn, and is no protection against mice or insects. The ordinary contents of the storeroom include dry groceries, <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> <ingredient>pickles,</ingredient> <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> and cake; the latter should be kept in close boxes of wood or tin, which should be frequently cleaned. Hot food should 
 
<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=37"/>

never be put into the storeroom, because it gives out steam, and thus favors dampness, and also because it slightly heats the atmosphere.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE REFRIGERATOR.</purpose>

In most towns, <implement>ice-boxes</implement> or refrigerators are obtainable already made, but there is some discretion to be used in their selection. In choosing one, care should be taken that the frame is of hard wood, susceptible of a smooth finish, because a soft rough surface attracts and retains moisture and injurious odors from the <ingredient>water</ingredient> used in cleansing it, and from the ice, as well as from the food itself. If possible, the entire lining and shelves should be metallic; but, if they are of wood, they should be hard, and a double set should be employed so that some can be drying while the others are in use. Marbleized iron or zinc makes the best metal shelves. No <ingredient>water</ingredient> or sewer pipes should be connected with the <implement>ice-box,</implement> because poisonous gases readily pass through <ingredient>water.</ingredient> In so-called model apartment-houses, the refrigerator is sometimes connected direct with the drain by a small pipe, to permit the escape of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> caused by the melting of the ice: there could be no surer way devised to imperil the health of the inmates of the apartments. <implement>Ice-boxes</implement> and refrigerators, large and small, should be cleaned and aired often enough to keep them perfectly free from any odor. <ingredient>Meat,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> poultry, or <ingredient>game</ingredient> should never be laid upon shelves, but rather hung by hooks or laid upon racks: if the box is too small to permit this, they should be placed upon earthen dishes large enough to prevent contact with the box or shelves. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> should always be kept in closed jars, even when in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> for no other substance is so quickly affected by air and surroundings; it absorbs every odor and gas to which it is exposed, and takes on every taint in the atmosphere: therefore, as soon as its first natural heat 
 
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=38"/>

has passed away, it should be strained, and kept in covered vessels, unless it is put into a perfectly <ingredient>clean milk</ingredient>-room sheltered from air and dust. <ingredient>Butter,</ingredient> like <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> readily takes on odors and taint: it should always be kept in covered tubs or jars, with <ingredient>brine</ingredient> or a wet cloth covered with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> over it. It should never be put near <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> or vegetables which can impart any odor to it.</p>
<p>The <implement>ice-box</implement> should not be kept in a damp place, because dampness will cause the ice to melt, and predispose food to ferment and mould. No steam or furnace pipes or chimney-flues should be near enough to vary its temperature in the least degree, for this in itself is a frequent cause of injury to food. When the weather is variable,it is necessary to closely watch food which is not refrigerated. In the winter, there is less danger to food from decomposition than in summer; but some kinds are impaired by freezing. And then, too, there is always more or less danger of decomposition attending the thawing of frozen <ingredient>meats</ingredient>: they should be thawed at a dry temperature, only a little above the freezing-point, in a well-ventilated room, or in very <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient>--never near the fire, or in a warm kitchen. When <ingredient>meat</ingredient> has once been frozen, it should be kept at that temperature until it is thawed for cooking; for, when once thawed, it is likely to spoil quickly, especially in close, damp weather.</p>
<p>A word in regard to frozen vegetables: they should be placed in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to thaw, not exposed to the action of heat; but as freezing effects a chemical change in the substance and composition of vegetables,--as, for instance, when it partly changes the starch in <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> into glucose,--they should generally be protected from frost. Vegetables will be referred to again in treating of the cellar.</p>
<p>As dampness favors decomposition, even at a low temperature, the ice-compartment in refrigerators should be separated from the food-closet by permanent walls, so that 
 
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=39"/>

moisture cannot be directly communicated from ice to food. The only efficient refrigerator is one that thus separates the ice from the food, and has an outlet for the <ingredient>water</ingredient> caused by the melting of the ice. It is a mistake to use this <ingredient>water</ingredient> for drinking or cooking purposes, for it generally contains impurities from the ice. A glass- or porcelain-lined receptacle placed next to the ice-compartment, and filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> will cool pleasantly. The vessel should be washed out and filled with fresh <ingredient>water</ingredient> every day, and should be entirely closed from the air; for <ingredient>water</ingredient> impregnated with odors or vapors from food, or with those which pervade living-rooms, is unfit to drink. As <ingredient>water</ingredient> standing in open pitchers for any length of time loses all its natural gases, and absorbs the deleterious properties in the atmosphere, so, equally, that which is exposed to the odors of food in the refrigerator becomes injurious.</p>
<p>In cool weather, <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>game,</ingredient> and poultry may be kept in a wire safe for a reasonable length of time. The same general care should be given to the safe which the refrigerator requires. Its frame should be of hard wood; the racks or shelves, of metal, marbleized or galvanized iron; and the wire-cloth painted as often as it shows any trace of rust, because a rough, rusted metallic surface will attract and retain deleterious odors, and particles of decomposed food.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE CELLAR.</purpose>

In cities, cellars are generally quite underground, and too often contaminated by sewer- and drain-pipes. It is impossible to take too much care to guard against this danger. To a great ,extent, dampness can be obviated in cellars, by flooring them with concrete, and ventilating them thoroughly: for this purpose there should be movable windows, in good working-order, with direct communication with the outer air.</p>
 
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=40"/>

<p>Cellars cannot always be lighted without artificial means, but they can be kept clean and dry. A little <ingredient>copperas</ingredient> dissolved in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> used for making <ingredient>lime</ingredient>-wash, or some good disinfectant, can always be used to purify the air; and care can be taken that no dirt of any kind accumulates. As this subject is treated exhaustively in the author's work on "Diet for Invalids," no more need be said here. If <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or vegetables are kept in cellars, they should be examined frequently, and all spoiled portions removed. The darkness necessary to the preservation of some vegetables can be secured by covering them with old clean blankets or carpet, or, better still, with several thicknesses of newspaper, which can be thrown away when they <ingredient>bear</ingredient> any trace of mildew: the blanket or carpet should be dried frequently, and washed when it becomes at all mildewed. The temperature of cellars where vegetables are kept should be regulated so that they can neither freeze, nor spoil from excessive heat: a safe temperature is about 50&#176; Fah.</p>
<p>When vegetables are kept in bins, they should be made of hard smooth wood with covers; otherwise, barrels and boxes with covers should be used. If those roots and tubers which are to be kept until late in the winter are packed in layers, in sand or clean moss or excelsior-shavings, they will keep fresh and good in a dry, cool cellar. <ingredient>Apples</ingredient> may be packed in this way, or in <ingredient>dry sawdust,</ingredient> or wrapped in soft paper, and stored in barrels or boxes. Winter <ingredient>pears</ingredient> may be laid between the folds of an old clean blanket, on a shelf, in a dry cellar. <ingredient>Cranberries</ingredient> are best preserved by keeping them covered with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemons</ingredient> do well in the same way; care should be taken that the <ingredient>water</ingredient> does not freeze, and it should be changed often enough to maintain its freshness. <ingredient>Parsnips</ingredient> are generally left in the ground during the winter, but they may be kept in sand in the cellar. If <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> are kept in sand, they are less apt to become corky 
 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=41"/>

than when exposed to the air. <ingredient>Celery</ingredient> keeps well, quite buried in the sand. <ingredient>Squashes</ingredient> and <ingredient>pumpkins</ingredient> require a cool, dry place. Cabbages may be laid in heaps, or packed in barrels, with the root up, and a thick covering of their own outer leaves upon the top, under the cover of the barrel or bin. <ingredient>Onions</ingredient> should be spread upon shelves, or kept in well-aired baskets. <ingredient>Beets</ingredient> should be buried in sand, as also <ingredient>carrots.</ingredient> <ingredient>Potatoes</ingredient> keep well in barrels in a cool, dark part of the cellar. As the spring approaches, or if they begin to show signs of germination at any season, they may be put into baskets with handles, and placed in <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> for three minutes; after that they are to be thoroughly drained, and then returned to the cellar: the heat of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> destroys the young <ingredient>sprouts,</ingredient> without injuring the rest of the <ingredient>potato</ingredient> for subsequent cooking. <ingredient>Sweet potatoes</ingredient> require a very dry place, but do not keep any length of time; so that, unless the family is large, they should be bought only in small quantities. All the vegetables which are used green, or in an immature condition, should be dried, canned, or preserved in their season. <ingredient>Radishes</ingredient> and <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> may be raised during the winter, in warm cellars; and <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> and <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> in window-boxes, at any temperature suitable for house-plants; <ingredient>mustard</ingredient> and cress will grow from <ingredient>seed</ingredient> within a few days in window-boxes.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose rend="italic" align="center" placement="heading">THE CARE OF MILK AND BUTTER.</purpose>

Reference has already been made to the importance of taking special care of the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> intended for daily consumption in the household; but where one or two <ingredient>cows</ingredient> are kept, and a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is made, a few more directions may be useful.</p>
<p>It is as important that the <ingredient>cows</ingredient> and their shed should be kept perfectly clean, and that they are properly fed, as that their <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should receive attention; and the housekeeper 
 
<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=42"/>

should see to this, although such details belong properly to those having care of the cows. When cows have been fed upon <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> or <ingredient>turnips,</ingredient> or have eaten <ingredient>onions</ingredient> in the fields, in such a way that the taste is perceptible in the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> add to it, as soon as it is drawn from the <ingredient>cows</ingredient> and strained, one quart of <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to each two gallons of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> or have a piece of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> the size of a pea powdered and put into each pail before milking the cows. Either of these methods will generally destroy the foreign flavor, without injuring the <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> but if the cows are shut up so that they have no access to such food for six or eight hours, the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> will be sweet. The cows should be milked kindly and gently, and not immediately after any violent exercise; and, when possible, always by one person who understands their idiosyncrasies, and can get all the <ingredient>milk</ingredient>: if a <ingredient>cow</ingredient> is not milked thoroughly, the quantity will gradually decrease and become poor until the supply ceases altogether. When a cow is unquiet during milking, a piece of rock-<ingredient>salt</ingredient> put into a trough for her to lick will generally keep her quiet; but if she is vicious, her legs must be strapped.</p>
<p>Tin pails, scrupulously clean, are best for milking: if wooden ones are used, they must be of hard, smooth wood, scalded and then rinsed with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> before being used. The <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be strained directly it is drawn, and set in a temperature of about 60&#176; Fah. to become cool: <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should always be cooled before it is covered in any way. Deep tin pails, with a handle for lifting, are better for setting <ingredient>milk</ingredient> for <ingredient>cream</ingredient> than the old-fashioned shallow pans: they should always be kept scrupulously clean, being scalded, aired, and sunned after each time of use. <ingredient>Cream</ingredient> should be skimmed according to the season, in twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six hours. If the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> sours under the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> no harm is done; but it should not be allowed to stand before skimming, until the curd and <ingredient>whey</ingredient> separate.</p>
 
<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=43"/>

<p>When enough <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is ready from one skimming to make <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> it need only be set away without disturbance until it becomes slightly sour,--from twenty-four to forty-eight hours: but when it has to be accumulated, an ounce of pulverized <ingredient>salt</ingredient> may be put into the bottom of a two- or three-gallon jar; and, every time <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is put in, it should be thoroughly stirred with that already in the jar. Any drops upon the inside of the jar should be wiped off, and it should be kept covered with a piece of gauze. A shallow ladle is best for skimming, and it need not be perforated. No wind should be permitted to blow over the surface of <ingredient>cream</ingredient> while it is rising, and it should be protected from dust. The most <ingredient>cream</ingredient> seems to rise upon <ingredient>milk</ingredient> cooled by ice. Although <ingredient>cream</ingredient> needs to be a little sour before churning, it must not be allowed to become at all bitter: the churning may be done two or three times a week.</p>
<p>Before using the <implement>churn,</implement> it should be scalded for one minute with <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> then emptied, and partly filled with very <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for five minutes: after that, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be poured out, and the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> put into the <implement>churn.</implement> Very thick <ingredient>cream</ingredient> should be thinned with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> before churning. When the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> froths much in the <implement>churn,</implement> the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be used soon after it is made, because there is some condition of the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream</ingredient> which will prevent the keeping of the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Churn with a series of steady, even strokes, about sixty to the minute, and stop when the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> comes in small, firm masses. At some seasons it is necessary to put some very <ingredient>cold milk,</ingredient> or a piece of ice, into the <implement>churn </implement> before the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will come; this may be done if it does not begin to appear in about half an hour: <ingredient>butter</ingredient> comes in about half an hour when the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is at a temperature of about 65&#176; Fah.</p>
<p>When the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> comes, if it is very soft, put ice or very <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> into the <implement>churn</implement> so that it will harden enough to be taken up. Remove the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> from the <implement>churn,</implement> to a clean

table or butter-tray, with a wooden paddle, first wetting both in very <ingredient>cold water.</ingredient> Never use the hands in working <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> With the ladle, cut down through the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and press it firmly, to work out the <ingredient>buttermilk;</ingredient> but do not smooth it, because that breaks the grain of the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> If the weather is warm enough to make the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> soft, put a piece of ice upon it, and trust to the second working to extract the <ingredient>water.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is worked out, spread the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> out on the tray or table, sprinkle over it the finest dairy-<ingredient>salt,</ingredient>--about an ounce of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient>--and then, using the same cutting motion, thoroughly work the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> into the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Some <ingredient>butter</ingredient>-makers add about a quarter of an ounce of fine <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> to each pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> at the first or second working: the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is a good corrective to any trace of bitterness in the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and helps <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> it. After the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> has been worked into the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> put it away to harden again. When the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is hard, repeat the working with the ladle, to work out all the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and use a cloth repeatedly wrung out of ice-<ingredient>water</ingredient> to pat the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> while working it; do not work long enough to soften the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> but <ingredient>extract</ingredient> all the moisture, so that a clean surface is presented when cut, with only a slight dew upon it. Then either make it up in pats or rolls, wrap each one in a wet cloth, and sink them in <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> or pack the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in <implement>firkins</implement> as directed below. The <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be of a rich yellow color, sweet and nutty in flavor, and showing a fine close grain when broken, or an even surface slightly bedewed with colorless moisture when cut. Freezing does not impair the taste or keeping-quality of <ingredient>butter</ingredient>: but if it is long exposed to the air, it is apt to become rancid upon the surface; and this rancidity gradually penetrates the entire mass, and develops an acid which is poisonous when brought into contact with any copper surface.</p>
<p>All packed <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be put into <implement>firkins</implement> or tubs made of hard wood,--<ingredient>oak</ingredient> or hemlock,--which have been soaked 
 
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=45"/>

in <ingredient>brine</ingredient> for twenty-four hours, and then wiped, and sprinkled with <ingredient>fine salt.</ingredient> Pack the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> down tight and close, and cover the top layer with a cloth wet in <ingredient>brine</ingredient> and sprinkled thickly with <ingredient>fine salt.</ingredient> If the tub is not filled at the first packing, when more <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is ready to put in, remove the cloth, rinse it in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> wipe or wash off with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> any <ingredient>salt</ingredient> which may have fallen upon the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> pack in what is ready, and again cover it as before with the wet cloth and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient></p>
<p>A good <ingredient>brine</ingredient> for <ingredient>butter</ingredient> can be made as follows: Dissolve in a gallon of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as much <ingredient>fine salt</ingredient> as it will receive,--that is, until <ingredient>salt</ingredient> can be seen upon the bottom of the vessel containing the <ingredient>brine;</ingredient> then put it over the fire, with an ounce of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and a level teaspoonful of powdered <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> and let it boil up; after that, cool it, strain it, and use it.</p>

<hd align="center">CHAPTER II.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">MARKETING.</hd>
<p>AS the excellence of a dinner depends as much upon the quality of its materials as upon the skill of the cook, it is incumbent on the good housekeeper to have some knowledge of marketing. If a good cook can do better with poor materials than a poor cook with the best supplies, how great will be the satisfaction in a repast which supplements judicious selection with perfect cookery! The skilled marketer must have experience, but even the youngest beginner can gain some advantage from such clear and explicit description as is presented in this chapter.</p>
<p>The complaint is often made, that the pictures of meat given in cookery-books do not resemble the meat as it appears in market. The pictures given in this work have been carefully engraved from photographs taken from sides of meat ready to be exposed for sale. The lines which indicate the different joints represent the average lines employed in cutting meat by butchers in various parts of the country: relatively the difference is so slight, that in giving lessons in the cutting of meats, in many places, only unimportant variations have been observed, and even these concerned the names rather than the actual forms of the cuts. Individual butchers may vary their cutting-lines a few inches, but the main ones given in the several engravings are accurate enough to serve as a general guide to marketers.</p>
 
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=47"/>

<p>Before entering upon the detail of meat marketing, a few words may be well said upon the importance of freshness in food of all kinds, and especially when several kinds are used for making one dish, such as a soup or a stew. The least taint in any ingredient will impair the flavor of the dish, and often produce temporary discomfort or positive illness; therefore the marketer should not be tempted to purchase wilted vegetables, or meat upon the verge of spoiling, because the price may be low. In fact, the rule may be accepted, that fair goods command a fair price; the only notable exception being when marketing-days occur only two or three times a week, or at the end of the week, when the food is sold at a reduction towards the close of the day, by dealers who do not wish to take the risk of keeping it. Street-peddlers seldom have fresh wares, even if they give good measure; because they generally buy at a low rate, from dealers whose supplies are upon the verge of spoiling. This is especially the case with fruit: the street-peddlers are most active when the market is glutted with green or over-ripe fruit for which there is no legitimate demand. In some localities, however,--notably in country-places,-- honest small dealers supply their scattered customers by wagon-route, greatly to the housekeepers' convenience: of course the foregoing remarks do not apply to them.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">THE PREPARATION OF MEAT FOR MARKET.</hd>
<p>This is a matter requiring close care and nice calculation; and, under the manipulation of skilled slaughterers, all parts of the creature have an actual market value. The finest hair of beef, after thorough cleansing, is used in the manufacture of coarse blankets; the long tuft on the end of the tail is employed in upholstery; the coarse hair is made into <implement>mortar;</implement> the skin is tanned for leather; the horns are used for combs, knife and umbrella handles, buttons, and various 
 
<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=48"/>

other articles of use and fancy; the bones and refuse of the horns and hoofs become fertilizers, or are made into glue; the feet yield neat's-foot oil; the blood and offal are made into fertilizers; all superfluous fat is made into either oleomargarine or oil.</p>
<p>In New York and some other large cities, the butchers employ the Jewish method of slaughtering, which consists of draining the carcass of all the blood. After the animal is killed, the interior is examined to make sure that the meat is in a perfectly healthy condition; and it is then cut up for sale. The intestines and their surrounding fat are removed; the heart, liver, and kidneys being prepared for the retail trade. The layer of fat which surrounds the intestines is stretched over the inner surface of the body, and held in place by wooden <implement>skewers,</implement> so that it may not contract in cooling: it is this fat which is so excellent in spring lamb. The outer coating of fat, mingled with a thin layer of flesh, is often cut so that in cooling it contracts, and forms fanciful figures on the surface of the meat. The thickness of this outer layer of fat is a safe indication of the condition of the carcass: well-fed animals show thick back-fat, and the kidney-fat or suet is very abundant, while the entire flesh is marbled with small lines of fat. The last joints of the legs are carefully cleaned, and the head is freed from hair and horns.</p>
<p>The entire flesh of the head of beef in this country is generally made into sausage-meat; but in Europe it is sold, either fresh or cured, under the name of ox-cheek: the palate is a special delicacy there, and many dishes are made of the brains. In this country the tongue is generally the most important part of the head, being used fresh, or corned with salt, or pickled and smoked. As a matter of fact, most of the edible viscera can be made into palatable and nutritious dishes; and some of the so-called cheap cuts of meat 
 
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=49"/>

are preferable, on the score of flavor and strength-giving properties, to the most expensive. For instance, the shoulder of mutton is much more delicate than the leg. And the <emph rend="italic">filet</emph> or tenderloin of beef, generally the most expensive cut, has less taste and nutriment than any other part of the flesh of the animal: it is simply tender; and that is because it is composed of muscular fibre which is worked but little, and consequently is not as well nourished as those parts that are so exercised as to make their circulation rapid and ample. When we offer the tenderloin of beef to a guest or an invalid, we only give them the most expensive meat, not the best. And so it frequently is with mutton: contrary to the general impression prevailing in this country, the shoulder is the choice portion; in England, where the best mutton in the world is raised, it is that which is set before the guest, while the leg is relegated to the family table as being the more economical and less delicate. It is a favorite maxim among good old-fashioned housekeepers, that only prime cuts of meat are available and of good value. But this is the case only when the family taste insists always upon a roast or a steak: when any variety of fare is acceptable, many of the cheap cuts can be made into delicious dishes; and, when there is a general demand for them, butchers will willingly keep them to meet it, and thus in a measure equalize the price of more expensive cuts.</p>
<p>It is not always that the average late marketer has the opportunity of buying the best meats. In cities, the buyers for large hotels, restaurants, and clubs market very early, or have the choice parts reserved for them. Then, too, every dealer will have his special customers whose wants he endeavors to supply: if he is honest, he will of course give all his customers as good as he has on hand, and they may rely upon his opinion; but there are occasions when the buyer may safely depend upon individual judgment.</p>
 
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=50"/>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">GOOD POINTS IN MEATS.</hd>
<p>A few clearly defined points will enable any ordinarily careful and intelligent person to select a good quality of flesh from what is offered. The best meats are from well-fed, mature animals, which have not been overworked, and the meat of which has been carefully transported from the slaughter-house to the market. A loose texture of flesh in full-grown meats indicates an excess of water, which will cause the meat to shrink in cooking or preserving it in any way. The flesh of grass-fed meat is of this character; while that of "stall-fed" or "corn-fed" animals has a firm, dense fibre, admirably calculated to retain its substance, either under the action of heat in cooking or of salt in curing it. Of the three best-known mature meats, beef has the largest and firmest fibres, and pork has the densest, closest texture; and therefore both are well suited for curing. About one-fifth of the weight of flesh is composed of the solid substances of fibrine, albumen, and gelatine; the residue being the juice of the flesh, which consists of water and some soluble salts that are essential to the preservation of health. It is this juice, of which salted meats are largely deprived, which is too often lost by improper methods of cooking; as in the pounding of beefsteaks, under the erroneous impression that they are thus made tender, when really the labor of mastication saved by the breaking of the fibres is more than handicapped by the loss of the juice entailed by the pounding operation. When the fibre of meat is over-tough, it can be softened by using vinegar during cooking, according to the directions given elsewhere. </p>
<p>The fact is not always known to city marketers, although it is generally well understood by people in the country who kill their own meat, that the flesh of animals and birds is always most tender if cooked while it is yet warm with vitality. Every sportsman who has cooked game in the field or 
 
<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=51"/>

camp directly it was killed, has demonstrated this fact. A familiar domestic instance of it is the practice of the famous negro cooks of the South, of cooking chickens before their flesh grows cold after they are killed. If a bird is killed, picked, and cooked at once, it will always be tenderer than if it is allowed to grow cold and stiff. Beef, or any meat which has been killed long enough for the warmth of life to leave it, will be dense and hard of fibre until the stiffness of the muscles consequent upon the loss of vital heat, that causes toughness, has been overcome by that relaxation of the tissues which precedes the beginning of actual decomposition of the flesh. No matter how prime the animal is before killing, after the flesh is once cold it will be hard and tough until this muscular change takes place. As considerable loss in weight is consequent upon the long keeping of <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> butchers are sometimes unwilling to assume it; but they will generally hang <ingredient>meat</ingredient> long enough for it to become tender, if their customers will take it at its first weight.</p>
<p>The flesh of young animals seems tender, because of its softness and looseness of fibre. Its texture is naturally less firm than that of mature creatures, but it is correspondingly less nutritous; and, while it appears to be easily masticated, it is really only less entirely reduced to the condition of <ingredient>pulp</ingredient> which permits the beginning of digestion, because its soft, semi-gelatinous fibres elude the teeth, while the comparatively short time it remains in the mouth does not favor that complete admixture with the saliva which is necessary to the first stage of digestion. This is the reason why such young <ingredient>meats</ingredient> as <ingredient>veal</ingredient> and <ingredient>sucking-pig</ingredient> are not desirable foods for persons whose digestion is impaired. While the flesh of young <ingredient>meats</ingredient> seems thus relatively tender, it is not so acceptable to the palate as that of mature animals in good condition.</p>
<p>A glance will show an experienced marketer the difference 
 
<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=52"/>

between good and poor <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The first has a fresh, bright color, with plenty of back- and <ingredient>kidney-fat,</ingredient> and fine thread-like particles of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> running through the flesh: the odor is sweet, and the general appearance clean. On the other hand, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in bad condition is dark and dull in color, without the tracery of <ingredient>white fat</ingredient> throughout the flesh and its abundance on the back and about the <ingredient>kidneys;</ingredient> even if the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is abundant, its color will be yellowish and its consistency soft; the odor will be more or less unpleasant. No amount of washing will restore the excellence of stale or tainted <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> or counteract its poisonous effect upon the system. The fact should be remembered in this connection, that <ingredient>meats</ingredient> which have been kept on the ice, and are then exposed to the action of a warm atmosphere, taint much more quickly than those that have never been iced.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">BEEF.</hd>
<p>Good <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is of a clear, bright-red color, veined or marbled with whitish <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> with abundant <ingredient>kidney-fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> and thick back-<ingredient>fat</ingredient>: the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> of a prime creature is of a clear, whitish-yellow color, rather hard and brittle, as contrasted with the dull yellow <ingredient>fat</ingredient> of inferior <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> which is also soft and greasy. The second grade of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is of a dusky-red color, with scant <ingredient>fat</ingredient> interspersed among the muscular fibre and very little upon the back and <ingredient>kidneys;</ingredient> the odor of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is good; and, if it is hung long enough, the flesh will be comparatively tender. Poor <ingredient>beef</ingredient> has little or no back-<ingredient>fat,</ingredient> very scant yellowish <ingredient>kidney-fat,</ingredient> and dark-red, hard flesh; in cooking it, the aid of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> will soften the fibres to some extent, but it can never be made entirely good; if the odor is rank and strong, it will always be noticeable.</p>
<p>The carcass of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> as marketed is cut into sides, and these again into fore- and hind-quarters. The engraving show a side of <ingredient>beef</ingredient> with the cutting-lines placed where 
 
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=53"/>

<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=54"/>

most butchers locate them: in different parts of the country, they vary slightly; but, as has already been said, the difference is more in name than in appearance. The choicest parts of the carcass are along the line of the backbone. One rather unusual cut, the baron of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> is not shown: it consists of the double <ingredient>loin</ingredient> or <ingredient>sirloin,</ingredient> and is too large for ordinary purposes, the average weight being about one hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The following figures indicate the position, in the picture, of the different cuts of <ingredient>beef</ingredient>:--</p>
<list align="indent1"> <item> 1. Shin, or leg; used for soups and plain stews.</item>
<lb/><item> 2. Round; used for steaks, pot-roasts, and beef <emph rend="italic">&#224; la mode.</emph></item>
<lb/><item> 3. Rump; used for steaks, stews, and corned beef.</item>
<lb/><item> 4. Butt or flank steak; used for steak, pressed beef, and corned beef.</item>
<lb/><item> 5. Large sirloin steaks; large, juicy steaks, used for broiling and frying.</item>
<lb/><item> 6. Sirloinroast or porterhouse steaks; used for the choice roast or beefsteaks.</item>
<lb/><item> 7. Flank; used for corned beef or stews.</item>
<lb/><item> 8. Navel; used for corned beef.</item>
<lb/><item> 9. Plate; used for corned beef.</item>
<lb/><item>10. Ribs; used for roasting.</item>
<lb/><item>11. Chuck ribs; used for roasting and steaks.</item>
<lb/><item>12. Shoulder-piece; used for soups, stews, mince, and pot-roasts.</item>
<lb/><item>13. Shank, or shin; used chiefly for soups.</item>
<lb/><item>14. Neck; used for soups, stews, and hash or mince.</item>
<lb/><item>15. Brisket; used for corned beef, spiced beef, and stews.</item>
</list>
<p>There is choice to be exercised in regard to steaks and roasts. The hip- or thick-end of the sirloin or porterhouse cut makes the finest beefsteaks, the two hip-bone or tenderloin steaks being the best large beefsteaks in the entire carcass. The middle porterhouse steaks are smaller, and have a good proportion of tenderloin or <emph rend="italic">filet;</emph> the thin end of the 
 
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=55"/>

sirloin gives small porterhouse steaks of excellent flavor. Beyond the hip-bone sirloin steak, come the flat- and round-bone sirloin steaks, which are large, juicy, and well-flavored; then the ordinary large sirloin steaks reach to the rump-piece. The tenderloin or <emph rend="italic">filet</emph> of beef runs under the sirloin, beginning at the round-bone sirloin steak, and running up to about the third small porterhouse.-- from fifteen to twenty inches,--and weighing five pounds or more. Rump and round steaks cut from fine beef are composed of firm, juicy, well-flavored flesh, and in point of nutriment compare favorably with any portion. The roasting-ribs are cut from the fore-quarter; they number in all thirteen, and are usually cut in twos or threes, according to the size or weight required. The first two or three are called the first-cut ribs; then come the second- or middle-cut, reaching as far as the fifth or sixth rib; the third-cut ribs reach up to the chuck- or shoulder-ribs, which begin at the ninth rib: all these cuts are juicy, tender, and highly flavored. The four chuck-ribs proper run up to the neck. The piece of shoulder-blade running through the chuck-ribs can be cut out by the butcher, and replaced with a piece of fat. The chuck-ribs are divided according to the requirements of the purchaser: their flavor is sweet; and, as they are marbled with fat in good beef, they rank next the sirloin, either as roasts or steaks. The chuck nearest the neck is inferior in quality to the other end near the ribs proper.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">VEAL.</hd>
<p>The best veal is from a milk fed calf about six weeks old. Veal less than a month old is watery, soft, and insipid. Good veal shows a fine-grained, juicy flesh, of a delicate pinkish color, with firm white fat. When the food of calves is changed to grass, hay, or meal, the character of the flesh changes: it is harder, less juicy, and darker in color, and the fat grows yellowish. When the flesh of veal is very white, 
 
<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=56"/>

it may have been blanched for the purpose of changing the appearance of poor veal to that of good quality. The flesh of the second quality of veal is red, contrasted with the pinkish-white prime flesh, and the fat is coarser-grained and less abundant. The poorest kind of veal has decidedly red flesh, and very little kidney-fat. When the kidney-fat of any quality of veal begins to grow soft and clammy, the meat is on the verge of spoiling. Bob-veal is the flesh of calves killed when they are less than three weeks old: the flesh is soft, semi-gelatinous, and sticky, and the fat is scant and flabby. It is utterly unfit for food: being the first flesh of the young creature, unchanged by the healthful action of sun and air, it is devoid of those elements which make good flesh a wholesome food. The influence of sun and air upon the blood of animals is well understood by stock-raisers, who have demonstrated that far better meat is produced by animals fattened in the open air than by those that are housed for any considerable length of time. The annexed cut represents a carcass of veal prepared for market, the lines being those generally followed in cutting it up.</p>
<list align="indent1"><item>I. Leg, including part of the flank; used for cutlets and roasts.</item>
<lb/><item>2. Loin; used for roasts and chops.</item>
<lb/><item>3. Flank: this part is often nearly all cut with the leg, but if separated it makes a good roll for baking or stewing.</item>
<lb/><item>4. The ribs lying under the shoulder; used for roasts, chops, and stews.</item>
<lb/><item>5. Breast; used for stews, pot-pie, and baking.</item>
<lb/><item>6. Shoulder; used for roasts and baked dishes.</item>
<lb/><item>7. Neck; used for broth and stews.</item>
<lb/><item>8. Feet; used for jelly.</item>
</list>
<p>The hind-quarter of veal is generally considered the finest, but the rib-chops are exceedingly good. In a small carcass 
 
<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=57"/>

<illustration><caption>Side of Veal.</caption><description>Illustration of a large side of veal hanging over a chopping block with a large butcher knife next to it.</description></illustration>
 
<pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=58"/>

of veal, the hind-quarter would be divided simply into loin and leg, and the fore-quarter into shoulder, breast, and neck.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">LAMB.</hd>
<p>Spring lamb is divided simply into fore- and hind-quarters by a middle cut, which leaves several of the ribs attached to the hind-quarter. The latter commands the highest price, because it presents the greatest available quantity of meat; but its flavor is not superior to that of the shoulder. If a lamb is very large, the neck may be separated from the fore-quarter to use for stews. Very delicate dishes are made from lamb's feet.</p>
<p>Spring lamb proper is from six weeks to three months old. House-lamb is lamb fed under cover during the winter months. Lamb is sold from spring until late winter, not being called mutton until after it is a year old. The weight of small spring lamb is from twenty to twenty-five pounds; and, as the season progresses, the size increases to about a hundred pounds. As the lamb grows larger, chops are cut from both fore- and hind-quarters; the former being called rib-chops, and the latter loin-chops or cutlets, as they are taken from the loin or leg. Sometimes small sheep are dressed like lamb; but the difference is shown by the darker red of the flesh, the comparitive scantiness of the fat, and the white color of the bones as opposed to the reddish bones of lamb. The back- and kidney-fat of lamb is hard, white, and abundant; and the flesh has a delicate rosy tint. The flesh of the second quality is darker and less firm than that of prime lamb; the grain is coarser, and the fat less white and abundant.

<hd align="center" rend="italic">MUTTON.</hd>
<p>Mutton is prime from creatures about three years old, fed out of doors, and especially upon hillsides. The fat of prime mutton is abundant, white, and hard; the flesh is firm and juicy, and of a clear-red color; and the bones are white. The flesh of second quality is darker and closer-grained, the fat is scanty and yellowish, and the flavor is rank. Poor mutton has pale, flabby flesh, scant thin fat laid close against the flesh but not interlined with it, and the flesh parts easily from the bones. Diseased mutton has decidedly yellowish fat, and soft, flabby flesh. Small mutton is cut like large lamb; large mutton is cut by the lines indicated in the annexed cut.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">PORK.</hd>
<p>The best pork for general table-use is from carcasses weighing from fifty to about a hundred and twenty-five pounds. The color of the flesh is a fresh pink; and the fat is hard and white, not less than an inch thick upon the back, and very abundant about the intestines. The skin of young pork is whitish and semi-transparent. The second quality of pork has rather hard red flesh and yellowish fat; the poor sort has dark, coarse-grained flesh, soft fat, and a generally inferior appearance. Measly pork, which is unfit for use, has little kernels in the fat; the kernels or yellowish lumps sometimes show in the lean, and the entire flesh has a dull look. The tenderloins of pork correspond with those of beef in place: they are of sweet and tender flesh, and during the winter season can generally be bought. When the back-fat of pork is very thick, some of it is removed from the parts which are to be used for roasts and chops; when the skin is dressed on roasts, it is scored in lines about half an inch apart.</p>
<p>The accompanying cut shows a carcass of pork as divided for general cooking-purposes. When the entire creature is designed for salting, the cuts differ a little, but not materially.</p>

<p>That part of a carcass of pork used for bacon is the flank and brisket, including the belly and the thin part of the ribs: it is first thoroughly salted, and then dried or smoked. The flitch of bacon is the entire side between the shoulder and the leg. Brawn is the entire length of a side, pickled, after it has been boned and rolled, and then boiled.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">POULTRY.</hd>
<p>There is no season when it is impossible to obtain good poultry of some kind; but in warm, damp weather it is advisable to select that which has not been long killed, or preserved on ice, as both are likely to spoil quickly. In selecting fowls, see that the skin is clean, soft, and not badly torn, that the flesh looks plump and light-colored or whitish under the skin, and that some fat is apparent. Young fowls or chickens have large feet and long necks in proportion to their size, and the lower end of the breast-bone is so soft as to bend easily in response to slight side pressure: the cartilage does not harden into bone while the chicken is young enough to be absolutely tender. Of course there are tender large fowls and capons, bred especially for the table, which are well grown, and abound in delicious flesh. If the head and feet are upon dressed poultry, they will generally indicate its condition. The eyes will be full and bright, and the feet soft and pliable, when the poultry is in good condition: if it is poor and stale, the feet will be dry and stiff, the eyes sunken and dull, and the flesh dark-colored and changing to a greenish hue about the back and vent, as the poultry nears the point of spoiling. There are so many devices for restoring stale poultry which has not actually reached the stage of putrefaction, that the only absolute safety lies in buying from honest dealers. The head of a capon, which is always left on the bird, is smaller in proportion 
 
<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=65"/>

to the body than that of ordinary poultry; the comb is more withered and pale; the neck-feathers are longer; and the body is shorter, fatter, and more plump. The flesh of capons is very tender and juicy: the weight is usually from eight to twelve pounds. Capon turkeys are unusual but delicious. The best spring chickens are those which have a full breast and are plump and short: those which have long legs and large bones are less satisfactory. Bantam fowls, which are sometimes marketed, are short and plump, about the size of a partridge; and their flesh is excellent when they are young and fat.</p>
<p>Turkeys are in fine condition when the flesh looks white and plump, and they have full breasts and smooth legs: old turkeys have rather thick skins covered with long hairs, and the flesh is purplish under the skin. Hen turkeys are smaller and plumper than male birds, and of less intense flavor: turkey poults, or young turkeys, are very tender and delicate, but not full-flavored. The finest turkeys that are marketed are the mutton-fed birds: they are fat, juicy, and well-flavored.</p>
<p>Young ducks, or ducklings, and goslings are among the most delicious poultry: they are very fat, and the flesh is highly flavored. Good ducks and geese are plump, with abundance of semi-transparent, soft fat: they have a pliable breast-bone, flesh-colored and brittle beaks, and windpipes that break when pressed between the thumb and finger. As the birds grow old, the color of the feet and beaks changes from yellow to red. Goslings are sometimes called green geese.</p>
<p>Pigeons and squabs, either domestic or wild, are generally in market. Pigeons are good when the breasts are large and plump in proportion to the size of the bird. The flesh of old birds is very dark-colored, that of good ones is dark red, and of squabs so light as to be almost pink. The 
 
<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=66"/>

squabs, also, are very short and fat, and have full round bodies and soft legs and feet.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">GAME-BIRDS.</hd>
<p>Game-birds are abundant in all parts of America, in their season, and can usually be bought in good condition from reliable dealers. The breasts should always be full and tender, and the skin upon the rump and about the vent clear and freshly colored: if there is any appearance of discoloration, the birds are stale. A few feathers plucked from these parts will disclose the color of the skin, and a touch will indicate the condition of the breast. Despite the fact that epicures like game hung until it is upon the verge of putrefaction, it is neither safe nor wholesome food in that condition: when it is reasonably fresh, it cannot be excelled. Among the larger game-birds, the canvas-back duck is the best. It is as abundant in the great North-western lakes as upon the Eastern seaboard, and the canvas-backs of the Pacific Coast are delicious. This duck may be distinguished from other species by the appearance of the feathers on the back of the male bird, which resemble a piece of rough canvas. The bills of canvas-backs run nearly on a line with the top of the head, and are about three inches long: they are black, as contrasted with the bills of other wild duck, which generally show some trace of color. When the bills of other ducks are black, they are usually of a different shape to those of canvas-backs.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">GAME.</hd>
<p>Large game is abundant and varied, and is good until it begins to taint. Prime game is clean and fat, and free from any unpleasant or musty odor. The most abundant is venison; but buffalo, bear, elk, antelope, wild sheep and goat, and rabbits, hares, squirrels, raccoons, otters, beavers, badgers, and musquash or muskrat, are frequently marketed,- 
 
<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=67"/>

the latter especially in Southern cities, where the old colored cooks convert them into excellent dishes. </p>
<p>With all game, the judgment of a reliable dealer is the best guide for the buyer; but a few hints may be given as to the possibility of keeping game in order to make the flesh tender. All wild meat will keep good longer than domestic meat, because of its firm texture. In average temperate weather, clear and dry, meat which has not been frozen will keep the following length of time: veal and pork, one day; lamb, two days; beef and mutton, from three to ten days; large poultry and game-birds, from three to six days; small game from two to five days, and large game about a week. In clear winter weather, meat and game frozen in the air will keep until there are signs of a thaw: they should then be put into an ice-house, where they will remain frozen, or thawed out in cold water and speedily used. In warm, muggy weather, and during summer rains, meat exposed to the air spoils quickly; and the conditions of warmth and moisture to which it is exposed are not unlike those which prevail when frozen meat is exposed to the heat of the fire in roasting and baking. Meats should be hung up, and entirely covered with thin cloth or fly-screens, in a cool, dark place, free from dampness: they should not be laid upon dishes or boards, because the blood which flows from them taints more quickly than the flesh itself. It is for the purpose of entirely removing this blood, that butchers scrape their <implement>meat-blocks</implement> instead of washing them. Meats designed for broiling, roasting, and baking can be hung longer than those which are to be boiled.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">FISH.</hd>
<p>In selecting fish, have it as fresh as possible. This condition is indicated by the fulness and brightness of the eyes, and the clean skin and firm flesh: above all, the odor should be sweet and fresh. Fish which is marketed in a 
 
<pb n="38" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=68"/>

frozen state should be thawed in cold water, and cooked at once. Sea-fish, and those which run from the sea into bays and rivers, have the finest flavor: fresh-water fish sometimes have a muddy taste, which can be removed to some extent by soaking them in salted cold water for a couple of hours before they are cooked. All fish are best before spawning: after that period, the flesh becomes soft and watery. Good crabs and lobsters are heavy in proportion to their size, and while uncooked their movements are rapid if they are in good condition: if cooked, their odor is sweet as long as they are good. Oysters, clams, scallops, and mussels should be eaten as fresh as possible always. Salted and smoked fish should always have a good odor and clean appearance.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">VEGETABLES AND FRUIT.</hd>
<p>All juicy and green vegetables should be very fresh and succulent, and are best just before flowering, as also are the sweet herbs called pot-herbs. Roots and tubers should be full and fresh-colored: if withered or sprouted, they are inferior. The green vegetables should not be bought in larger quantity than can be used while they are still fresh: they will keep best if sprinkled with water, and laid in a cool, dark place. All the roots and tubers are improved by laying them in cold water for an hour before using them. Details of the keeping of vegetables are given elsewhere.</p>
<p>Fruit when fresh should be ripe and sound, as perfect as possible (because this will make less waste), and bought only in quantities which admit of speedy use, unless it is winter-fruit which can be kept without any danger of spoiling. Preserved and dried fruits keep well in cool, dark places, and so may be bought safely in quantities.</p>

<hd align="center">CHAPTER III.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">METHODS OF COOKING.</hd>
<p>WHATEVER the manner chosen for the dressing of food, it can be traced to some one of the comparatively few fundamental methods of cookery. These methods will be given in this chapter in sufficient detail to enable the least-experienced cook to follow them readily. If the fact is once accepted, that in cookery similar results follow definite operations as certainly as they do in any other manual work, there need be no uncertainty or failure. Let any one understand that it requires a fixed degree of heat to make water boil, and it will not be expected to boil at any less heat: it is equally to be supposed, that, if a safe and easy way is shown to accomplish a given result in cooking, it will be generally followed in preference to less clear and reasonable ways of work.</p>
<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">ROASTING.</purpose>

The most primitive cookery was undoubtedly done at an open fire. And it yet remains for science to find a better method; for this reason, when it is possible, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> should be roasted before an open fire, rather than baked in an oven as most so-called roasts are now cooked. At the old-fashioned open fire upon the hearth, it was easy to roast, because there was in the same spot before the fire the intense heat required for cooking, and the constantly changing current of air necessary to carry away from the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> the fumes of burning 
 
<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=71"/>

<ingredient>fat,</ingredient> which must impair its flavor, and the steam set free from its interior, which destroys the crispness of its surface if confined about it as in baking. In the oven, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> drawn out by intense heat spatters against the hot sides, and burns; while the steam generated by heat from the natural moisture of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> if confined to the oven, cannot fail to soften the surface. This point will be reverted to in treating of baking <ingredient>meats.</ingredient></p>
<p>It is possible to <ingredient>roast meat</ingredient> before many of the modern cook-stoves and ranges, because there is a movable front before the grate containing the fuel. When this is the case, <ingredient>meat</ingredient> can be roasted with aid of the tin case open on one side, called the Dutch- or <implement>tin-oven.</implement> A clear, hot fire should be made. The <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> properly prepared, should be hung in the oven, and placed directly in front of the grate; the greatest available heat being required to quickly crisp the surface, and thus retain the <ingredient>juices</ingredient> of the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The <implement>tin ovens</implement> are generally provided with a movable hook in the top, upon which the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is hung, and by means of which it can be turned without changing the position of the oven: some of the ovens are made with an automatic spring, that keeps the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> constantly revolving upon the hook, and so favors a uniformly brown surface.</p>
<p>In the various recipes in this volume, for <ingredient>roast meats,</ingredient> full directions are given for their treatment, so that here it is necessary only to say that they should be cleansed by wiping with a wet cloth, instead of being washed, because <ingredient>water</ingredient> extracts their <ingredient>juices;</ingredient> that no <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should be applied to cut surfaces until they are brown, because that, too, has a tendency to draw out their <ingredient>juices;</ingredient> and that no <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be put into the <implement>dripping-pan</implement> for basting, because it can never get as hot as the hot <ingredient>fat</ingredient> upon the surface of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and it also generates steam which impairs the crispness so desirable in a roast. Basting should be done with the <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=72"/>

which flow from the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> or with <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> After the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is brown, it may be seasoned; and, if a "frothed" surface is desired, <ingredient>flour</ingredient> may be dredged upon it every time it is basted. Directions for making <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> are included in each recipe for the different roasts. Anthracite <ingredient>coal,</ingredient> coke, <ingredient>charcoal,</ingredient> <ingredient>hard</ingredient>-wood embers, and gas afford good heat for roasting, because their heat is intense, and they do not impart any unpleasant odor to the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">BAKING.</purpose>

As is said in the preceding paragraph, baking is not the most desirable way of cooking <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> but the ovens are often available when an open fire cannot be reached. When there are two or more ovens in a stove or range, they should be set apart for the baking for which they are specially adapted. The hottest should be chosen for <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> because equally in baking as in roasting it is desirable that the first exposure of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> should be to the greatest obtainable heat, in order to quickly crisp its surface, and confine its natural juices: besides this, there is the additional fact to be remembered, that <ingredient>meat</ingredient> put into a cool oven will sometimes become tainted before it is cooked; that is, the degree of heat will be high enough to forward rapid decomposition, but not high enough to cook the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The oven should be too hot to permit the hand to be held in it even for a moment. It cannot be too hot at first; for, the more quickly the outside of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is crisped, the more entirely its <ingredient>juices</ingredient> are retained. The heat can be moderated when it has served this purpose.</p>
<p>To prepare the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> for baking, wipe it with a cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> but do not wash it, because that tends to draw out the <ingredient>juices;</ingredient> trim off all defective portions; lay it in a <implement>baking-pan</implement> without salting it, and quickly brown it; it may then be seasoned, and "frothed" by dredging it with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and basting it with <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The <ingredient>bones</ingredient> cut from the joint may be put into the pan with it; and a little <ingredient>beef</ingredient>- 
 
<pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=73"/>

<ingredient>suet,</ingredient> or <ingredient>salt pork</ingredient> if it is not <ingredient>fat</ingredient> enough to yield <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> or some scraps of vegetables and <ingredient>sweet herbs,</ingredient> may be used under it. But no <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be put into the pan: the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> even when boiling, is not as hot as the outside of the <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> and, in addition, the steam which rises from it softens the entire surface of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and draws out its <ingredient>juices.</ingredient> It is futile to expect to restore the extracted <ingredient>juices</ingredient> by means of basting; if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is not washed or salted, and is quickly browned, it will retain its <ingredient>juices</ingredient> so entirely that a rich <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> will flow from it when it is carved. Directions are given elsewhere for making <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> from the <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> of baked <ingredient>meats.</ingredient></p>
<p>The reason why separate ovens should be used for <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and pastry is because the particles of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which fly from the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> while it is baking burn upon the sides of the oven, and impart their odor and flavor to delicate cakes and pastry. Different <ingredient>meats</ingredient> should not be baked in the same pans: the fact that they are often so cooked at hotels and restaurants is one reason why such <ingredient>meats</ingredient> generally lack their distinctive flavor.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and pastry ovens do not require to be so hot as those in which <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is baked, and means must be devised to moderate their heat when it is excessive; opening the doors, or slides in the doors, of the ovens, cools them rapidly. Their temperature should always be ascertained before any thing is put into them to cook. All the flues, and the top and bottom of the ovens, should be kept free from <ingredient>ashes,</ingredient> and the dampers should always be in good working order. When an oven is too hot at the top, cool it by opening the door, and then guard the top of whatever substance is baking by covering it with buttered <ingredient>paper</ingredient> or with an extra pan turned over it. If the oven is apt to burn from the bottom, cover it half an inch deep with clean sand: this will disperse the superfluous heat evenly throughout the oven. 
 
<pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=74"/>

If an oven will not heat, have it attended to by the stove-maker or tin-smith: if an oven is without ventilation, have the close door changed for one supplied with ventilators. The latest improvement in stove-ovens is the attachment of a wire-gauze door in place of the iron door: the idea is an admirable one.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">BROILING.</purpose>

The general principles of roasting apply to broiling. The circulation of free air around the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> carries away from it all the smoke arising from the burning <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> at the same time with the products of combustion from the fire. The fire must be hot enough to quickly sear the cut surface of the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and only when this is done will the <ingredient>juices</ingredient> be retained.</p>
<p><ingredient>Meat</ingredient> for broiling should be cut from an inch to an inch and a half thick; the surface should be scraped with the back of a knife, to remove sawdust and bonedust, and then wiped with a wet cloth, but not washed. It is useless to attempt to broil well with a poor fire; for the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will be smoked, and will lose part of its valuable <ingredient>juices.</ingredient> When the fire is clear, put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> over it, as close as possible to it, and crisp first one side and then the other; if the fire is very hot, it will not be necessary to turn the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> repeatedly while it is being browned. After both sides of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> are brown, hold it far enough away from the fire to prevent burning, and finish cooking it to the desired point; when the fire is hot, and the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> cut as directed above, it will cook medium-rare in from fifteen to twenty minutes. A good way to hold the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> away from the fire, after the first browning, is to place two bricks on either side of the opening in the stove which contains the fire, and lay the ends of the <implement>gridiron</implement> upon them; the distance can be regulated by changing the position of the bricks.</p>
<p>After the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is browned on both sides, it can be tested without cutting into it, or removing it from the <implement>gridiron,</implement> by 
 
<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=75"/>

quickly pressing the tip of one finger upon it: if, when the pressure is removed, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> springs up again, the fibre is still elastic because it is uncooked, and if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> were cut it would be found to be very rare; when, after the pressure, the surface of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> slowly returns to its original level, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is medium-rare; when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> retains the mark of the pressure, it is well done. While the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is being broiled, heat a dish to receive it: after it is laid upon the hot dish, season it with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> on both sides, and serve it at once. <ingredient>Broiled meat</ingredient> always deteriorates by being left standing near the fire any length of time after it is cooked.</p>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">FRYING.</purpose>

Frying proper is performed by entirely immersing any edible substance in enough smoking-hot <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to cover it; but a form of half-frying is sometimes used for <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> and chops when broiling is out of the question. When this kind of frying is properly done, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will be juicy, well-flavored, and will closely resemble <ingredient>broiled meat.</ingredient> It is necessary to make the frying-pan very hot over the fire, before putting the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> into it. Any kind of frying-pan can be used without danger of burning the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> except a marbleized-iron pan, which is unsuitable for use over intense heat. When the frying-pan is so hot that it will siss when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> touches it, put in the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and brown it quickly, first upon one side and then upon the other, as in broiling; then finish cooking it to the desired degree, and season and serve it: in fact, the process is similar to broiling, save that the hot frying-pan replaces the fire. If <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> is desired for fried <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> stir a tablespoonful of dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the little <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> in the frying-pan, and when the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is brown stir into it a pint of <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> season the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> stir it until it boils, and then serve it in a <ingredient>gravy</ingredient>-bowl. No <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>fat</ingredient> need be put into the pan unless the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is absolutely 
 
<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=76"/>

lean: in that case, use only enough to prevent the burning of the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
<p>The frying of <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-balls, <emph rend="italic">croquettes</emph>, doughnuts, and other foods should be done in a deep frying-pan, or round-bottomed kettle called a <ingredient>Scotch</ingredient> bowl, half full of <ingredient>drippings,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or <ingredient>olive-oil,</ingredient> at choice: <ingredient>olive-oil</ingredient> is the best medium for frying <ingredient>fish</ingredient> of any kind. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> must be placed over the fire until a thin smoke begins to rise from its surface: at that temperature, its heat will crisp the outside of any food put into it, and so prevent that soaking of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which renders some fried foods so unwholesome. As soon as the fried article is browned to the desired degree, and floats upon the surface of the hot <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> remove it with a <implement>skimmer,</implement> lay it upon brown <ingredient>paper</ingredient> for a moment to free it from <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> and then serve it at once.</p>

Boiling consists of immersing any article in actually <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and maintaining the temperature of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> at the boiling-point until the article is cooked. Stewing and simmering are forms of boiling, as will be explained hereafter. Rapid and continued boiling slightly hardens the surface of vegetables, thus preserving their form, color, and flavor, and is advantageous: details on this point are given in the recipes for cooking vegetables. On the other hand, the <ingredient>hard</ingredient> boiling of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> makes it tough: stewing and simmering are the best ways of cooking <ingredient>meat</ingredient> after it has once been brought to the boiling-point. <ingredient>Salted boiling water</ingredient> is slightly hotter than fresh <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient>: chemists make use of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to heighten the temperature of <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the <emph rend="italic"><implement>bain-marie</implement></emph>, or <ingredient>salt-water</ingredient> bath, in which vessels are placed containing boiling substances which require an unvarying high heat. To boil fresh <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> plunge it into <ingredient>salted boiling water,</ingredient> and, when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boils again, place the vessel containing it where the boiling will be maintained at a gentle degree until the article 
 
<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=77"/>

is cooked. If <ingredient>salt</ingredient> or <ingredient>smoked meats</ingredient> are to be boiled, place them over the fire in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> gradually approach the boiling-point; maintain a gentle boiling until the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is tender: if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is very <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> it may be necessary to pour away the first <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and replace it with more that is actually boiling. When <ingredient>salted meats</ingredient> are to be used cold, they are best if allowed to cool in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which they are boiled. The details of boiling the different <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> poultry, vegetables, and puddings, are given in the proper recipes.</p>
<p>Stewing and simmering consist of first bringing any article of food to the boiling-point in <ingredient>water</ingredient> or <ingredient>sauce,</ingredient> and then continuing the cooking at a very gentle rate of boiling until the food is done. These kinds of boiling make food very tender and digestible, and prepare its properties for immediate and complete nutrition: they are invaluable in treating tough <ingredient>meats.</ingredient></p>

The removal of <ingredient>bones</ingredient> from cooked birds is not to be called boning: those cooks who so prepare <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and call it "boned <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient>" simply create a confusion of terms. One reason why there is so much uncertainty about American cookery is because many housekeepers modify a standard dish according to their own ideas, and then retain the original name.

<hd align="center" rend="bold">CARVING.</hd>
<p>IF a little reasoning were applied to carving, it would seem far less difficult than it is supposed to be. A little attention to the location in a bird, fish, or joint of meat, of the bones and joints, enables any person with a tolerably correct eye and steady hand to strike and separate the joints and sinews of small dishes, and to avoid the unmanageable bones in the larger ones. The cuts in this chapter will serve to illustrate the garnishing of dishes as well as carving.</p>

The carving of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is simple. The following cut represents a baked <ingredient>fish</ingredient> garnished with <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient> Before cooking, the fins and tail are trimmed close, and several deep cuts made in each side of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> to permit the <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> used for basting to penetrate the flesh; the <ingredient>head</ingredient> is left on, because some persons prefer the small flakes of flesh which lie under and back of the eyes. The <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is laid upon a little <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> or a folded napkin, on a hot dish, and garnished with a little <ingredient>parsley.</ingredient> To carve either a baked or a boiled <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> run the <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-knife by the side of the back fin, from the figure I to 2; next, cut from the back fin down to the middle of the under part of the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> following the dotted lines; then, by slipping the <ingredient>fish</ingredient>-knife under the cut portions, they can be easily lifted off and served. After one side has been

served, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> can be laid over upon the dish, and the other side served in the same way; this gives a portion of both

After some attention has been paid to the location of the joints, care should be taken, in carving poultry, to fix it firmly with the fork to prevent slipping in the dish, and then to make clean cuts from the point where the knife is inserted.

<hd align="center">CHAPTER V.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="bold">THE DINING-ROOM AND ITS FITTINGS.</hd>
<p>WE are all so unconsciously affected by surroundings, that a homelike room at once impresses us with an indefinable sense of comfort and welcome. A pretty aspect inspires us with cheer; a gloomy one depresses. Of all rooms in the house, the dining-room should be the cheeriest, because it is there that all the members of the family are most likely to congregate. No matter how widely the interests and occupations of father, mother, and children may separate them at other times of the day, the fact remains that at least one-fifth of their waking hours will probably be spent at the table. The intent business-man may find scant time for the ordinary social pleasures which may attract the other members of his family to the sitting-room, library, or drawing-room; but to the dining- room he must go if he ever lives at home. And for this reason, if for no other, when all the apartments of a house cannot be made equally attractive, preference should be given to this, the one most used in common.</p>
<p>Many dining-rooms that we remember are furnished with dark wood; the walls are gloomy, or covered with dismal pictures of dead game and fish; the windows hung with stuff curtains, and the outlook is upon stone walls or paved courts. The ideal dining-room is bright with sun- or lamp-light; the window-draperies are such as to temper but not exclude air 
 
<pb n="74" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=104"/>

and sunshine; the pictures are of fruit or still life with bright colors; the chairs are comfortable, and the temperature a pleasant medium between heat and cold. The most modest establishments admits these possibilities, and from them the plainest repast gains a charm. Even where space is so limited that one room must answer both for the preparation and service of food, neatness and order can be maintained; and a little attention to the principles of ventilation will insure that freshness of the atmosphere which is so essential to the enjoyment of food.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">A VERY SIMPLE DINING-ROOM.</hd>
<p>Let us take an instance from the simplest effort at housekeeping; say, that the kitchen and dining-room are one. The floor may be bare; indeed, a wooden floor, clean, or stained to imitate dark wood, with one or more rugs,--which may be of rag-carpeting, drugget, or finer goods,--is preferable to a carpeted floor. For the same reason, wooden or bamboo blinds, or thin curtains of linen or cotton, are better than woollen window-draperies, because all woollen fabrics retain odors persistently. The walls can be clean, if there are no pictures; and if the chairs are of the straightest outline, they can be made comfortable with inexpensive cushions. There is no condition of life so lowly as to preclude the possibility of neatness at the table; if there is no linen, the table itself can be clean; if the supply of dishes is limited, it is far more kindly and gracious for the wife or daughter to rise from the table, and wash the plates and cutlery, than to allow meat and pudding to be eaten with the same appliances. When there is plenty of crockery, the trouble is slight compared with the subsequent comfort, if one of the family rises to bring clean plates and knives to replace the soiled ones; and the dignity of the most charming daughter of the house could suffer no detraction if she were to remove 
 
<pb n="75" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=105"/>

the crumbs from the cloth before placing the dessert upon it. A hungry man, pressed for time, perhaps hot and labor-stained, comes home for dinner; if he finds a freshly laid table awaiting him, with a neat little wife who has taken a few moments to tidy herself after cooking, ready to give him a hot and savory dinner, and looking as if she had not taken too much trouble to prepare either the dinner or herself for his coming, the chances are that he will feel an involuntary inclination to freshen himself before beginning his meal: if, on the other hand, he is greeted with the unwelcome sight of a disorderly table, ill-cooked food served in slovenly fashion, and a frowzy wife without a suggestion about her of the trim girl who first attracted his fancy, no one can blame him if he throws himself into his chair unwashed, bolts his food surlily, and hurries away from such a foretaste of purgatory.</p>
<p>Just here a bit of the philosophy of common life fits admirably,--the adaptability of persons to circumstances; the ever-recurring forbearance with the individual idiosyncrasies of different members of the family; consideration for personal traits and peculiarities. Every newly married wife, and some old ones, would do well to heed this little commentary on careless living. No matter how limited the household fittings, they can be kept clean: and, above all things, personal cleanliness is a matter of personal choice. Take the dinner--any family dinner may be served in the plainest way, and accepted by its eaters as a good dinner; but with the addition of a little care in dishing and serving, it may assume the aspect of a holiday feast. One of my Syracuse friends, when considering the merits of rival candidates for the supremacy of her kitchen, had this qualification urged upon her: "Mem, I have lived with Mrs. W. on James Street, and she always has her dishes <emph rend="italic">varnished</emph>." Of course the girl intended to say "garnished." Think for a moment of the difference. Our bill of fare may be plain,--roast 
 
<pb n="76" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=106"/>

mutton with mashed potatoes, a dish of sliced tomatoes, and cups of custard or <emph rend="italic">blancmange:</emph> that is a very simple dinner. By putting around the mutton on the dish a few green leaves of parsley, celery, or watercress, the plain dish is made ornamental; the mashed potatoes can be heaped lightly on a platter, and browned in a hot oven, before serving them; the sliced tomatoes can be arranged in even circles in a pretty dish or salad-bowl, with a few green sprigs of celery, parsley, or cress, in the centre; and the custard or <emph rend="italic">blancmange</emph>, after being turned from the cups, can be ornamented by cutting a little hollow in the top of each, with a teaspoon, and filling it with a piece of any brightly colored jelly. With a clean cloth and napkins, and brightly polished cutlery and glass, the plain dinner takes on the aspect of a feast; and all these little embellishments are within the reach of very modest households.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">DECORATIVE ART THE REFLEX OF NATURE.</hd>
<p>Whether the family resources are narrow, or admit of some indulgence of taste in the choice of decorations in living-rooms, one rule should be followed: Do not encourage shams: let every thing be genuine. Do not paint wood to imitate bronze, or plaster to look like stone. Follow nature, and good taste will not be offended. Do not substitute the grotesque for the graceful, or make a sacrifice of comfort to carry out an idea. Remember that there is an eternal fitness in things. Comfort and taste can easily be combined. We may trust human nature to suggest the former: the latter is the fruit of unrecognized passing influences. The chance glimpse of a beautiful picture, the warmth of color flashing from some luxuriant country garden or glowing mass of flowers in a florist's window, the waving of sun-lit branches, the shifting panorama of the sky,-all feed our artistic inspirations. From art and nature, culture comes to the fancy 
 
<pb n="77" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=107"/>

ardent enough to admit its impressions. And the degree of culture possible to individuals shows itself in the homes they make for themselves. The family living-room may be plain in its appointments; but there is no reason why every one of its uncomfortable angles should not be filled with soft, restful cushions. The children leave traces of their growing-up in it. The faces of the old people who have there lived out their lives look down from its walls. The atmosphere is pregnant with personalities, if we will but feel them; so all these homely places are sacred to sweet and tender memories. We should never seek to change the aspect of our homes when we open them to our friends, if we want them to feel at home with us. We may sweep and freshen, if we will, for cleanliness and order are the first of home virtues; but we need not mask our houses any more than we would ourselves when we play the host. Good cheer and pleasant welcome, such as ought always to rule, are the soul of hospitality.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">SIDEBOARDS AND TABLES.</hd>
<p>In fitting the dining-room, its capacities should be studied. Unless there is ample space, no superfluous ornamentation should be attempted: all desirable room should be given to the necessary furniture. A movable extension-table for the centre of the room, and a side-table for carving and another for extra table furniture, will be needed, in addition to a buffet or <implement>sideboard.</implement> This carving-table can be made with side or corner supports holding shelves, and mounted on rollers so that it can be brought near the dining-table when it is required. The next two cuts are taken from Dubois, and show a movable table and <implement>hot-closet</implement> combined, with folding door upon one side, which can be opened in order to expose the dishes to the heat of the fire, and doors at the front through which the dishes can be arranged before the fire.</p>
<p>The <implement>sideboard</implement> may be of any fancied design which affords

<pb n="79" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=109"/>

the convenience of shelves for plate and table ornaments, and drawers and under-closets for linen, cutlery, plate, and fine glass-ware. The drawers used for plate, and the under-closets, should be provided with locks. A massive old-fashioned <implement>sideboard</implement> of great beauty was arched in the centre of the lower part, to afford space for a carved <implement>wine-cooler</implement> of the same general design, provided with a shelved compartment for salads and cold <implement>dessert-dishes.</implement> The kettle-drum tables for afternoon teas are small and portable, with a double shelf fixed under the top, midway of the <ingredient>legs,</ingredient> to hold extra cups and plates. But these tables belong in the parlor or reception-rooms, where refreshments are passed upon trays, and either held by the guests or placed upon some convenient stand. There should be several such tables in a room.</p>
<p>When a looking-glass or mirror is used, either as part of a <implement>sideboard</implement> or for wall decoration in the dining-room, care should be taken that no rays of sunlight strike it; because their chemical action will destroy the perfect distribution of the amalgam with which the reverse of the glass is coated, and so cause an appearance of granulation or crystallization upon the surface of the mirror.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">DECORATIONS OF CHINA AND PLATE.</hd>
<p>When fine china or old pieces of plate are used in decorating the dining-room, they should be disposed above the doors and fireplace, on shelves or brackets. The over-mantel can be made a beautiful part of dining-room decoration; and a railed bracket can be run around the entire room just above the <ingredient>head,</ingredient> after the fashion shown in the drawings given elsewhere of the dining-room in which the table is laid.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">CHAIRS FOR THE DINING-ROOM.</hd>
<p>Dining-chairs should be rather lightly constructed, so that they can be moved with ease; they can be made absolutely comfortable with practicable cushions, and small hassocks can be placed under the table for additional comfort.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">WINDOWS AND DRAPERIES.</hd>
<p>The arrangement of windows in the dining-room deserves attention. Not only the aspect of the room, but its healthfulness, depends upon the free admission of light and air. The use of any other material than woollen has already been advocated for window-hangings; the coolest for summer are bamboo or Venetian blinds, movable at will upon cords worked from inside the windows. An improvement upon the outside window-blind opening from the middle lifts the two blinds from their hinges, unites them in the centre, and then, by hinges at the top of the casement, lowers or raises them at will; a very simple form of movable cloth awning described by the author in "Harper's Bazar" of Sept. 22, 1883, answers the same purpose; and either contrivance replaces the more expensive regulation window-awning.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>East-Indian</ingredient> devices called <emph rend="italic">punkahs</emph> and <emph rend="italic">tatties</emph>--thick screens of woven fragrant rushes, hung before doors or windows, and saturated with <ingredient>water</ingredient>--cool the air of the room perceptibly. A woollen blanket, or even a thick sheet, suspended in such openings, and kept wet, will lower the interior temperature from 7&#176; to 10&#176; Fah., even in sultry summer weather. In any case, this fact is to be remembered: of all materials, woollen will the longest retain moisture and odor, and therefore is the least desirable for 
 
<pb n="82" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=112"/>

draping dining-room windows or doors, unless they are to be kept wet to cool the air.</p>
<p>When the outlook of dining-room windows is upon blank walls and paved yards, the unsightly prospect may be hidden without excluding light, by using Madras-muslin curtains, or any similar opaque drapery which permits the free passage of light and air. Figured lace, <implement>cheese-cloth,</implement> sheer nettings with dried fern or autumn leaves gummed upon them, will serve this purpose. Window-glass may be made opaque by patting it gently in every part with a piece of soft putty enclosed in a sheer muslin fabric, and then drying the surface of the glass; of course this will not admit of washing. There are many pretty patented devices of semi-transparent imitations of stained glass, which can be applied to ordinary glass windows when the expense of genuine stained or painted glass cannot be incurred. When there is both money and space at will, there can be no more appropriate or enjoyable window-decoration than that of stained or painted glass. The infinite variety in form and coloring offered in artistic and lovely designs makes an embarrassment of riches in this form of decoration.</p>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">LIGHT IN THE DINING-ROOM.</hd>
<p>If it is possible to admit sunshine to the dining-room, it should be done; at least, plenty of light should be secured. In California, where the climate permits open windows, and where the houses are generally detached, the fashion prevails of building bay-windows to catch from all points the sunshine and wandering airs that charm the senses in all seasons. When location permits, the windows of the dining-room should reflect harmonies of light and color. In the country this is possible, as also is the delight of an out-door dining-room upon the piazza or lawn; but in cities the dependence for such accessories must be placed upon neutral-tinted walls

and draperies, enlivened by freshly colored pictures, the light of open fires, and the soft colors of candle-flame and shaded lamps. If there can be only one open fire in the house, put it in the dining-room. One of the most acceptable effects of light is obtainable from the use of colored tissue paper for lamp- shades. The loveliest remembered one was seen in a delightful Southern home,--a lamp entirely hidden in a mass of pink roses, so artistically concealed that real sunlight seemed shining through a cloud of roses. These flower lamp-shades can be made by any deft fingers. They are quite safe to use until the paper becomes very dry and crisp, nearly charred by the heat of the lamp; then they should be renewed. Candles and lamps give a softer and more acceptable light than gas; and there are now so many devices for making both available, that it has come to be a matter of choice in their use; they are specially effective at the dinner-table.</p>

The fact has been mentioned in connection with window-draperies, that all woollen fabrics attract and retain odors, especially those arising from heated <ingredient>fat;</ingredient> for this reason, as well as upon the score of cleanliness, a movable carpet or rug is better for dining-room use than one nailed to the floor. Even in ordinary grades of carpeting, good colors are now available, and can be so combined that centre and border present an acceptable appearance. The rug can be shaken often, and hung for several hours in the air and sunlight, while the floor of the dining-room is being cleaned. When rugs are used, the margin of floors exposed should always be in good condition. If the wood of the floor is fine-grained, and the planks are neatly fitted together, it may simply be cleaned frequently, dry-scrubbing with sawdust being the best method; or it can be kept oiled or polished. When the wood is inferior, or imperfectly joined, the irregularities 
 
<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=114"/>

should be planed off, the nail-holes and cracks filled in with putty, and the floor subsequently painted or stained. Good methods are subjoined for producing all these different effects, together with hints for keeping the floors in good order after they are colored. When there is a smooth, hard floor of natural wood, it can be kept in perfect condition by dusting it daily, either with a soft, flexible brush, or a soft woollen cloth. The cloth may be used in the hand, or fastened to a long wooden handle to obviate the necessity for stooping. Linen and cotton fabrics are apt to leave lint upon the boards. In addition to the daily dusting, a weekly dry-scrubbing with sawdust is preferable to washing with <ingredient>water;</ingredient> even for varnished or painted floors, sawdust scrubbing is better than the use of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> which destroys the gloss of the surface, and gradually impairs its integrity by more or less absorption of moisture, especially in damp or foggy places.</p>

When the surface of the floor is uneven, it must be planed down, or rubbed smooth with coarse sandpaper, any projecting nails being first removed. The nail-holes and small cracks must be filled with putty: the large cracks may be filled in with strips of wood. When the floor is quite even, it should be washed clean, and allowed to dry thoroughly; then dust it, and finish it by any chosen process. The vehicle chosen for finishing the floor should be mixed in a rather shallow open basin or bucket admitting the free use of the brushes or rags used in applying the stain or polish. There should be two rags or brushes, one for applying the coloring, and the other for rubbing it well into the crevices of the wood: a small rag or brush is required for the corners and along the wainscoting. Begin to work in the corner farthest from the door. Do not have any open doors or windows if there is any dust flying. Brush or rub with the grain of the wood; make irregular stops, not straight defined lines across the floor; when the wood of the floor is well-grained, have the color mixed thin enough for the grain to show through it, and use strength to rub the color well into the grain of the wood. Soft woods will absorb more stain than hard ones; but a fair proportion is a quart of stain to sixteen square yards of flooring, and half a pint of varnish to protect the stain. After applying one mixture, the brushes must be thoroughly washed in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and dried before using them for another; one brush should be flat and wide for the open floor, and another small for the corners.</p>

<hd align="center">CHAPTER VI.</hd>
<hd align="center" rend="italic">THE DINNER-TABLE AND ITS APPOINTMENTS.</hd>
<p>THE extentsion-table has already been referred to as desirable, because its size can be suited to the number of guests. Usually this sort of table is comparatively long and narrow, and does not admit of as acceptable decoration as the round or square table. Then, too, at a long table the guests are less favorably placed than at either of the others. A perfectly appointed square table is pictured in the frontispiece, reproduced from the dining-room of a Euclid-avenue house in Cleveland. The first glance will show its admirable arrangement. The space included in the area of the apartment and the table permits the placing of six, eight, or ten guests, the ideal numbers for enjoyable dinners, the less number giving variety enough to obviate sameness, and the greater not being too large for perfect sociability. The breadth of the table permits the distinguished guests to sit side by side with the host and hostess, and affords room for effective placing of the necessary table appointments, specified in detail a few pages farther on. Delicate napery, flowers enough to add color to the glitter of silver and the sheen of glass, dainty receptacles for salt and pepper, and light candelabra make up a perfectly enticing picture: such surroundings would tempt an anchorite to feast.</p>
<p>This table is laid for the American form of service; the 
 
<pb n="90" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=120"/>

various dishes composing the dinner being placed upon the table in their proper succession, as will be hereafter indicated.</p>
<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">TABLECLOTHS.</purpose>

In choosing table-linen, it should be remembered that heavy material wears longer than the lighter fabrics, and presents in the draping much more effective lines; it does not rumple or crease so readily as sheer material; it needs but little <ingredient>starch</ingredient> when it is done up, and is therefore more pleasant for the user. After a certain point, the price of heavy fabrics is not greater than that of fine goods; but if it were, the difference would be warranted to an economical buyer by the relative results. When from personal preference a very fine, light kind of napery is used, there should be a thick under-cloth: indeed, the under-cloth is always desirable for the protection of the table, as well as for the improvement in the appearance of the cloth; heavy canton <implement>flannel</implement> makes the best under-cloths. The tablecloth proper should be of wash-material. If the table is large, the cloth may be made in several sections, for convenience in changing it during the dinner, and in washing it. A very effective and inexpensive cloth may be made in this way: Make an openwork centre-piece of any pretty appliqu&#201; or insertion over some faint shade of wash-satine, following the shape of the table; outside the centre-piece, and reaching from its edges to a point about a quarter of a yard below the edge of the table, have a section of the tablecloth proper; then a wide insertion, another piece of the cloth, and an edge of lace. The border of the cloth upon the laid table in the engraving will give an idea of this arrangement.</p>
<p>The use of lace upon table-linen was of early Italian origin, and was introduced into England before Shakspeare's time; so that we are only reviving a pretty fashion in elaborating our table-service.</p>
 
<pb n="91" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=121"/>

<p>When the effect of brighter color is desired, a strip of plush, velvet, or satin, edged with lace, may be laid the entire length of the table in the centre, over the linen cloth. When it is desirable to increase the light in the dining-room, strips of mirror-glass, with border-glasses for flowers, are used; or their edges are concealed by a thick line of cut flowers. A pretty effect is produced by using large cyrstal bowls filled with cracked ice and ferns, or blocks of ice bedded in moss and ferns; these blocks of ice may be made to hold shell-fish,prawns,crayfish, or dishes of mayonnaise, aspic, melons, or iced puddings. Some provision should be made for the dripping of the ice so that the cloth may not be spoiled.</p>
<p>When embroidery is desired, the outline of the woven design of the cloth can be reproduced with gold or silver thread or gold-colored embroidery-silk: these effects are Oriental. Clusters of flowers and <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> in natural colors are embroidered upon heavy momie-cloth or huckabuck, and the cloths are bordered with deep knotted fringe; some of the South Kensington designs for this kind of work are lovely. These cloths, with napkins to match, are suitable for noon breakfasts, luncheons, and high <ingredient>teas.</ingredient> A beautiful design is that of <ingredient>strawberry leaves</ingredient> and <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> of natural size and color, embroidered with silk floss upon heavy all-linen momie-cloth. Colored table-linen of good quality is always expensive, and the fact that very few colors retain their freshness after repeated washings makes it comparatively undesirable. <implement>Fruit-napkins</implement> are not too expensive to permit being put aside when they begin to fade. <ingredient>White</ingredient> linen is always in good taste, and color can be given by the use of fancy china, glass, and flowers; besides, white linen can always be fresh, an important consideration because so much of the enjoyment of the repast depends upon this. If the first glance at the table shows a spotless cloth and 
 
<pb n="92" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=122"/>

shining glass and silver, we involuntarily anticipate a good dinner. In households where it is necessary to economize, it would be better to buy plenty of less expensive linen, and spend extra time in doing it up, than to have a scant supply of fine material. Untidy table-linen is as intolerable as it is inexcusable: until the water-courses run dry, and there is no more sunshine and fresh air, there will be no good excuse for soiled tablecloths and napkins. Better a bare wooden table perfectly clean, than a creased and spotted cloth; and we might take a lesson in neatness from the Celestials, and substitute their paper napkins, which are used once and then burned, rather than omit to supply fresh ones at least once a day. This is a point too often neglected in well-to-do households.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">TABLE-NAPKINS.</purpose>

When there is an abundance of table-linen, different-sized napkins are used at the various meals. Dinner-napkins are the largest, and in quality should be heavy enough to obviate the necessity for using <ingredient>starch;</ingredient> of this the least quantity should be employed in doing up table-linen which will insure smoothness after ironing. At some very English dinners, the napkins are changed when the Roman punch comes on, a small, rather fine one being placed before each guest with the punch; with the <ingredient>game,</ingredient> comes another large one; and with the dessert, a soft finer fabric of medium size. At ordinary dinners, the change of napkins is made when the dessert is served; when the special dessert-napkin is used, it should be a little smaller and finer than the dinner-napkin, which is removed with the second course. The <implement>fruit-napkin</implement> is laid upon the <implement>finger-bowl</implement> or on the plate which contains it, a small fancy napkin, or <implement>doily,</implement> being directly under the bowl; when the <implement>finger-bowl</implement> is lifted from the <implement>dessert-plate,</implement> the <implement>doily</implement> is placed under it on the tablecloth, 
 
<pb n="93" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=123"/>

a little to the left of the <implement>dessert-plate.</implement> These <implement>doilies</implement> admit of many fanciful embroideries, outlines, and sketches made with a fine pen and indelible ink.</p>
<p>For formal breakfasts, large dinner-napkins and <implement>finger-bowls</implement> are used; for standing breakfasts, the usual breakfast-napkins, but no <implement>finger-bowls.</implement> Ordinary breakfast-napkins are smaller than those used for dinner: they may be quite plain, or bear the etched or embroidered initial or monogram of the hostess. For elaborate late breakfasts, the napkin may be richly embroidered to match the tablecloth.</p>
<p>Luncheon-napkins are intermediate in size between those used for breakfast and dinner: otherwise they resemble breakfast-napkins.</p>
<p>For the various <ingredient>teas</ingredient> and kettle-drums, small fancy napkins are used. Embroidery, etching, and fringes are quite in good taste. The tray-cloths should match the napkins.</p>
<p>Japanese paper napkins may be used for out-door refreshments where there would be danger of losing or spoiling good linen; but they are never so acceptable.</p>
<p>All napkins should be simply folded at private tables, one of the corners being lifted to cover the dinner <ingredient>bread;</ingredient> but care should be taken not to conceal the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> lest the guest, taking up the napkin inadvertently, should throw the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> upon the floor. When the dinner is in progress, the napkin lies upon the knees, or is used with one hand; after the napkin has been used, it is to be laid upon the table loosely, unless at the family table one is expected to place it in a napkin-ring.</p>
<p>The use of the napkin by table-attendants calls for a few words. A perfectly clean large napkin should be carried upon the left arm; and in passing dishes the attendant should cover the hand holding the dish with the napkin in such a way as to conceal the hand. When white gloves are worn by the attendants, the napkin is ready in case of 
 
<pb n="94" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=124"/>

accident. In pouring iced wines, a special napkin is required for each bottle; in pouring the other wines, unless the attendant's hand is gloved, it should be entirely concealed by the napkin.</p>
<p>There should always be an extra supply of clean napkins upon the side-table, to replace one when needed at the table, or to use in case of accident.</p>
<p>If a guest should drop a napkin while at table, no effort should be made to recover it until a sign can be made to the attendant to restore it. If it falls under the table, no attempt should be made to reach it, lest one's neighbor at table be inconvenienced. At the dessert, the dessert or <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> napkin is used, if they are placed, and the large white napkin is employed only to dry the tips of the fingers after they have been dipped in the <implement>finger-bowls;</implement> otherwise the large napkin continues in use to the end of the dinner.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">WASHING TABLE-LINEN.</purpose>

A few words may be in place concerning the washing of table-linen. When it falls with the work of the table-girls, there is often trouble in the kitchen and laundry, especially about the boiling and the use of the tubs, when there is a large family to be cooked and washed for. The table-linen need not be boiled often; and its washing can be greatly facilitated by soaking it for a hour or longer, before the first washing, in <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> in which powdered borax has been dissolved, using half a cupful of powdered borax to a large tubful of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> then wash the linen with very little good <ingredient>hard soap,</ingredient> rinse it in plenty of <ingredient>water</ingredient> till the <ingredient>water</ingredient> looks clear, and hang it out to dry at once.

when the meal is over. Iron-rust can generally be extracted by using <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and then rinsing the cloth. <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient>-stains can be effaced by using a tablespoonful of <ingredient>chloride of lime</ingredient> and a teaspoonful of <ingredient>lemon-juice</ingredient> or <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in a quart of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> as soon as the stain is washed out, rinse the linen thoroughly in plenty of <ingredient>clean water.</ingredient> Mildew on linen can be removed by soaking it in the solution of <ingredient>lime</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> and then rinsing it frequently; if the mildew is obstinate, mix enough powdered <ingredient>starch</ingredient> into <ingredient>soft soap</ingredient> to nearly thicken it, add to it some <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> cover both sides of the cloth with it, and expose it to the sun, letting it lie upon the grass, and renewing the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> until the stain disappears.</p>
<p>Iron table-linen single until quite dry, with a hot iron made smooth by rubbing it upon fine sand and then on a waxed cloth; when <ingredient>starch</ingredient> is used, a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> or wax, dissolved in it, prevents the sticking of the iron. Iron napkins in square folds; fold tablecloths by the thread, or roll them upon a round stick, as long as the cloth is wide, as soon as they are ironed.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">SILVER AND CUTLERY.</purpose>

The use of silver, or silver-plated ware, is so general that most housekeepers have their favorite methods of cleaning and preserving it from defacement; but a few points may be useful to the inexperienced. Careful housewives may take a hint from dealers, and keep their silver, when it is not in use, wrapped in soft tissue-paper, and closed from the air in its original cases, or in paper boxes; this will largely obviate the necessity for the frequent cleaning which injures plated ware quite as much as use.</p>
<p>The powders generally sold for polishing silver are composed of minute organizations of silicious nature, which produce a polish by covering the surface of the metal with innumerable imperceptible scratches, thus destroying some 
 
<pb n="96" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=126"/>

of the silver. If powder is considered necessary for cleaning silver, it should be almost impalpable, so fine as to pass through delicate muslin, like precipitated <ingredient>chalk</ingredient> or jeweller's rouge. Add three ounces of the <ingredient>chalk,</ingredient> and two ounces of liquid <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> to one quart of <ingredient>soft water,</ingredient> and, after thoroughly shaking these ingredients together, wet a soft cloth with the mixture, rub it over the silver, and then polish it with a piece of soft chamois. If silver is habitually washed with <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in which <ingredient>soap</ingredient> and a very little <ingredient>washing-soda</ingredient> is dissolved , it will not often require any other cleaning; the silver should be wiped dry with a soft cloth, and then gently rubbed and polished with clean <implement>chamois-skin.</implement></p>
<p>When the chamois is soiled, it can be washed as follows: Dissolve in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> enough <ingredient>soap</ingredient> to make a thick lather; in this wash the chamois, rubbing it between the hands or on a <implement>wash-board;</implement> put more <ingredient>soap</ingredient> upon stained parts, and continue the rubbing until the chamois is clean; then rinse it through two or three waters, lukewarm, squeeze out the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and hang it upon a clothes-line, in the sun, without wringing it; as it dries, take it down, and shake it with a sharp, snapping noise, then pull it straight out, and again hang it up; repeat the shaking and pulling until the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> is quite dry and soft.</p>
<p>Chamois-<ingredient>skin</ingredient> which is used for filtering should be washed carefully as follows: Make a very weak solution of <ingredient>washing-soda,</ingredient> <ingredient>borax</ingredient>, or any alkali, with <ingredient>warm water;</ingredient> wash the chamois in it without <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> and then rinse it through several cold waters; every time the chamois is used, wash it in this way, and dry and stretch it as directed above.</p>
<p>The use of steel knives as part of the dinner-equipage is regaining favor in this country. For a long time silver-plated blades maintained the supremacy; but now the sharp steel blade, set in an ivory or fancy wood handle, is found upon the best-laid tables. For the <ingredient>white ivory</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="97" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=127"/>

handles, the best polishing-agent is finely <ingredient>powdered chalk.</ingredient> Mother-of-pearl is brightened by washing it in <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> with subsequent hard rubbing with dry chamois-<ingredient>skin;</ingredient> <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-stains on the handles can be carefully scraped off, and the places polished. The steel blades of table-knives can be cleaned and sharpened at the same time by rubbing them carefully upon a board covered with <ingredient>emery</ingredient>-cloth, or by using <ingredient>emery</ingredient>-powder as bath-brick is used. The latter is the agent most generally known for cleaning steel knife-blades. It should be finely powdered and sifted to insure uniformity, and then applied either with a cloth or a cork, dipped in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> or with a piece of raw <ingredient>potato;</ingredient> before the knife is scoured, it should be washed clean, and then after scouring the blade can be wiped free from dust on a soft, clean cloth.</p>
<p>Of the use of the knife at table, there can be but little diversity of opinion among people of refinement in this country. The fork is used whenever it is possible to separate food with it, the knife being called into use only when it is required for cutting, but never to convey food to the mouth. As a matter of convenience, the knife-blade does not contain food to be lifted from the plate to the mouth as well as the three- or four-pronged fork: its use was fostered by the old-fashioned two-pronged steel fork, which is not often seen now. The fork is held in the left hand when it is used with the knife for cutting; otherwise it is held in the right. Apart from the general disuse of the knife in eating, its approach to the mouth is really a source of discomfort to a nervous or sensitive person; if only for that reason, the practice of using it ought to be abandoned. When the knife is not in actual use, it should be laid upon the upper right-hand side of the plate. When the fork is put down momentarily, it may be laid across the plate from either the right or the left, or crossed upon the knife. When both have been 
 
<pb n="98" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=128"/>

used finally, they should be laid diagonally across the plate, with both handles toward the right hand: this is understood by well-trained waiters to be the signal for removing them, together with the plate. The question sometimes arises, of the proper disposition to make of them in case the plate is passed to the end of the table for a second supply of <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> When the dinner is served in several courses, it is not customary to ask for the second quantity, because the appetite is satisfied by the variety served; but if from preference more is wanted, or at plain dinners, where only one or two <ingredient>meats</ingredient> appear, the plate is to be passed, the knife and fork may be laid upon the cloth if they are not in a condition to soil it, or both may be held in the right hand over the cloth. When the small plate for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is employed, as indicated in the description of the laying of the table, the knife and fork may be placed upon that until the large plate is returned. When the meal is served in several courses, knives and forks are either laid with the service of each course, or as many as will be required are placed when the cover is first laid,--with the exception of the small two-pronged silver or nickel fork for raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and <ingredient>clams,</ingredient> which is laid upon the plate containing them; and the silver <implement>fruit knife</implement> and fork, which are placed upon the <implement>dessert-plate,</implement> beside the <implement>finger-bowl,</implement> and then laid upon the table by the guest. As has already been said, when there is not an abundance of silver, arrangements should be made near the dining-room for washing it quickly in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> containing a very little <ingredient>washing-soda,</ingredient> for the purpose of removing the taste and odor of food.</p>
<p>Fine steel knives should never be exposed to intense heat; because it destroys their temper, and thus impairs their cutting qualities. Good <implement>carving-knives</implement> should not be used for cutting <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or in the kitchen: they should be cleaned so carefully as not to turn their edges, and always kept sharp 
 
<pb n="99" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=129"/>

by the use of a fine whetstone; a <implement>carving-steel</implement> more often injures than aids a <implement>carving-knife</implement> unless the person sharpening the knife has watched a butcher using a steel. A medium-size French cook-knife, of Sabatier's manufacture, makes an excellent carver, because the blade is thin and flexible, and made of good steel. There should always be in the kitchen good knives for cutting <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and vegetables; and a special knife for using about the stove. The best knife for this purpose is a medium-size artist's <implement>palette-knife</implement> of steel, with a wooden handle; the blade is flexible and broad, admirably adapted for turning small cakes, <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>, and omelettes, and wholly unlikely to be injured by the heat because it has no cutting edge.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">CHINA AND GLASS.</purpose>

When there need be no limit but taste and fancy in the furnishing of a table, beautiful effects can be produced with china and glass. When it is necessary to economize, only plain <ingredient>white</ingredient> china, and glass free from any set ornamentation, should be bought; because it is far easier and cheaper to replace plain ware if any is broken. Generally both decorated china and ornamental glass are sold in sets, and dealers are unwilling to supply any single piece; besides, the plain ware is less expensive originally than that profusely ornamented, and it combines well with odd bits of colored china and glass and bright flowers, and is always in good taste. Cut glass is always expensive, and easily broken. If exposed to sudden changes in temperature, it will crack by the force of contraction or expansion; for instance, if fragile glass is put into <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in frosty weather, it will often break. Glass should for this reason always be washed in tepid or cool <ingredient>water,</ingredient> using the hand to remove spots; it may then be set in a rack to dry, and afterwards be polished with clean, soft chamois, or cloth free from lint. The deep 
 
<pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=130"/>

indentations in fine cut glass can be polished by using a soft brush dipped in a little <ingredient>powdered chalk</ingredient> or <ingredient>whiting.</ingredient></p>
<p>Some of the finer kinds of glass-ware are annealed, or seasoned to bear heat, in the process of manufacture, and are therefore less likely to break than the cheaper sorts which have not undergone this operation. A somewhat similar process may be followed, which results in increasing the durability of the glass and china submitted to it. Put the articles which require to be seasoned in a large pan full of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> place the pan over a gentle fire, and slowly heat the <ingredient>water</ingredient> until it begins to boil; then remove the pan to the coldest part of the stove, and let the heat decrease gradually until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is quite cold. The articles thus tempered can then be wiped and made ready for use. After this first heating process, neither china nor crockery should be allowed to become very hot, either in using it at table or in washing it, because its glaze will be gradually seamed with cracks. Once this enamel is cracked, both <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>grease</ingredient> will penetrate the china, and it will even gradually absorb flavors from food: the cracking of the glaze also renders the china more liable to break. If in washing glass and china a wooden bowl or tub is used, there is comparatively little of the danger of chipping or breaking it which attends the use of a metal utensil.</p>
<p>When decorated china is selected, nice discrimination is required. Unless a <emph rend="italic">bizarre</emph> effect is sought, the pattern should show unity and delicacy: all grotesque ornamentation should be avoided, as also should glaring contrasts of color and a profusion of gilding. Gilded china always wears unequally; when not in actual use, it should be kept in a dry, dark closet, wrapped in soft <ingredient>paper;</ingredient> dampness tarnishes the gilt, and rubbing or scratching obliterates it. When gilt china is very much tarnished, the outer film may be removed by rubbing it very lightly and evenly with a 
 
<pb n="101" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=131"/>

piece of soft chamois dipped in jeweller's rouge, or in finely <ingredient>powdered chalk</ingredient> which has been sifted through thin silk. When gilt china is washed, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be lukewarm, and contain a little borax or <ingredient>soda</ingredient>: the china should be well drained, and then very lightly wiped with a soft cloth. All richly decorated fine china requires the same careful treatment. The finest Oriental china is of delicate even colors, without a line of decoration or a shade of contrast, but the effect is indescribably beautiful. In modern china, the most beautiful effects are in soft flower and sea-shell tints; except in a few sorts, such as Royal Worcester, where superb contrasts of color and gilt are made. For high teas and kettle-drums, the grotesque harlequin sets are sometimes used. After all, the choice of china is entirely a matter of individual taste.</p>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">LAYING AND SERVING THE TABLE.</purpose>

THE relative convenience of different-shaped tables has been referred to. Decidedly, the square and round tables are the most desirable; because, placed in a circle or nearly facing the host, no guest is given precedence except those who occupy the seats of honor at the right hand of the host and hostess respectively. If the shape of the room will not admit of the use of a round or square table, a good effect may be produced by placing the host and hostess at opposite sides of the long extension-table, facing each other: this position draws the entire company relatively nearer their entertainers, and those in whose honor the feast is given, and so increases both interest and enjoyment.</p>
<p>It has become the custom, in laying a table, to avoid uniformity of decoration in all matters except the massing of a few choice varieties of flowers,--unless a "pink dinner," or some such entertainment, is being given, when the purpose is to emphasize some special color; then the china, glass, flowers, lamp or candle shades, and even the ladies' costumes, take on the prevailing tone of color. Details of these effects are given elsewhere in the book. Of course the laying of all the covers must be uniform; and it is agreed that the service of a dinner is facilitated, and the general effect heightened, when more than one set of silver and cutlery is laid at first. There are so many dainty forms of 
 
<pb n="103" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=133"/>

such table-service, that a well-laid cover becomes a beautiful picture, especially when the table is large enough to admit of the proper placing of the various aids to the guests' comfort and convenience. Whatever form of service is chosen for the dinner, the articles used in good houses, in laying each cover, consist of the napkin, a dinner roll or a thick, small cut of fresh <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> the necessary cutlery and silver, the water-tumbler, and glasses for the different wines when <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is served, and, at convenient intervals, receptacles for the condiments, and iced <ingredient>water</ingredient> or ice. Individual <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-cellars are in vogue, but several larger silver or cut-glass ones may be placed upon the table, as well as some unique and pretty <ingredient>pepper</ingredient>-<implement>casters</implement> of metal or china. The <ingredient>salad-oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> are in double <implement>cruet-stands</implement> upon the table, or on the <implement>sideboard</implement> ready to be placed upon the table when the salad is served. The table-sauces are put on the <implement>side-board</implement> until required, being left in their original bottles. The large table-caster is a thing of the past, and is banished even from the <implement>sideboard</implement> unless it is really an ornamental piece. Individual <ingredient>water</ingredient>-bottles, with tumblers to cover them, are much favored, because of their convenience to this water-drinking nation. Dishes of broken ice are permissible at small dinners. The <ingredient>water</ingredient>-bottles may be filled with ice and frozen without much trouble, according to directions given later on. Some caterers make a specialty of supplying these frozen <emph rend="italic">carafes.</emph> The number of <ingredient>wine</ingredient>-glasses is, of course, regulated by the variety of wines to be served: this point will be amplified later.</p>
<p>Extra knives, forks, and spoons are upon the <implement>sideboard,</implement> ready to be placed by the attendants, between the courses: the <implement>oyster-fork</implement> is upon the plate with the shellfish, or is laid when they are served. When <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is served, as it often is in this country, a small plate and a special knife are placed for it. A nice idea for family dinners, or luncheons, is to
 
<pb n="104" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=134"/>

use a small plate, about the size of a saucer, upon which the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> can be placed, together with the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> when large <implement>salt-cellars</implement> are used. The teaspoons are upon the <implement>sideboard,</implement> to be placed upon the table when required. Small spoons are needed when <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is served in the little cups used after dinner for black <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic">caf&#232; noir.</emph> When there is not an abundance of silver, there should be, in a room adjoining the dining-room, all the conveniences for quickly washing and drying it; i.e., <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> and soft towels; a small piece of <ingredient>washing-soda</ingredient> dissolved in the <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> will thoroughly cleanse the silver from any odor or taste of food.</p>
<p>Uniform color has been indicated for the general table equipage; but if the table is large enough to admit of more than one group of flowers, or colored china, they should differ far enough to produce a contrast; and a change, however slight, should be made at every repast. At all seasons, flowers make a charming variation in the appearance of even the most simply laid table; and variety at the table is a great charm, quite as necessary to the enjoyment of the repast as is a good choice of dishes. Especially in the spring and early summer, the appetite is so capricious that it can be affected by such trifles of service as light and color. The perfect hostess will not despise even trifles, where the enjoyment of her guests is concerned.</p>
<p>The lighting of a dinner-table is of importance. The pleasantest light falls from candles or lamps, which should be so placed as not to incommode the diners. Lamps are sometimes suspended over the table, as are gas-fixtures. Side <ingredient>lights</ingredient> are apt to cross the light so that it is unpleasant: if they are used, they should be shaded. When it is desirable to give a prevailing tone of color, the <ingredient>lights</ingredient> and their globes or shades will be found most effective auxiliaries: details of these possibilities are given in the chapter on dining-room fittings.</p>
 
<pb n="105" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=135"/>

<p>The frontispiece represents the general effect of a well-laid table, and the detail of a cover is given on p. 106: if the directions are carefully studied, there will be no difficulty in carrying them out with the aid of the picture. We have in these two pictures the table laid for the service of a dinner in the American style, which admits of great beauty of ornamentation, and does not involve those tiresome and troublesome changes of the entire table-equipage according to the formal English method, where the cloth is changed with each course.</p>
<p>The table-cloth for all dinners should be <ingredient>white,</ingredient> and without perceptible folds or creases. It is not always easy to accomplish this triumph of laundry-work in small establishments; but it is possible if the cloth is carefully ironed, and rolled at once upon a long, round piece of wood, like a curtain-roller. As has been already said, the pretty fashion prevails of laying a strip of bright-colored plush or satin down the middle of the table, with a vine of smilax or ivy along the edges; as a variation, a strip of wide, very open lace, of a definite pattern, laid over a piece of satin, silk, or cambric, is sometimes employed. In arranging the table decorations upon and near this bit of color, due regard to harmony must be observed. The table-napkins should match the pattern of the cloth, and be large and square: they should be folded, and so placed that the guest will not be exposed to any awkwardness in using them: for instance, if a roll or piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is hidden in one, it may be thrown upon the floor by a careless movement; the dinner <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is best placed at the front or side of the plate, laid upon the napkin, but not concealed by it.</p>
<p>After the ornamental centre of the table has been planned (care being taken that it shall not be high enough to obstruct the view of the entire table), and the various dishes placed for condiments, relishes, and such small dishes as the chosen service permits,--the flowers being kept fresh until just before

<pb n="107" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=137"/>

the dinner is served,--each guest's place or cover is laid as follows: upon the left, a soup-spoon and two silver forks, one large; in the centre, the dinner-plate, upon which the plate of <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> or <ingredient>clams</ingredient> is to be set just before serving the dinner, or, if there is to be no shellfish, the napkin may be put here with the dinner <ingredient>bread;</ingredient> when the shellfish is served, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and napkin may be laid just above the spoon and forks, together with the <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-cellar and water-tumbler, or the small <emph rend="italic">carafe</emph> with the tumbler reversed upon it; at the right of the cover, a steel knife with a pearl or ivory handle, for <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> and a silver dinner-knife of medium size; sometimes a smaller knife with a silver blade and some fanciful handle is placed to be used for <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> salad, or <ingredient>butter</ingredient> when it is served, as it generally is upon American tables. The disuse of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> at dinner is to be traced to those countries where it is less plentiful than in America, and it is such a useful article of food that it is to be hoped the fashion in question will not generally prevail. When <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is served, the glasses may be symmetrically arranged at the upper right of the cover. When all the dinner-wines are used, it is well to have some of the more fragile glasses remain upon the <implement>sideboard</implement> until they are needed, placing at first upon the table a hock-glass for the <ingredient>white wine,</ingredient> a small <ingredient>wine</ingredient>-glass for the <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> and claret and <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> glasses; this is the number of glasses placed in the picture, in addition to a goblet for iced <ingredient>water.</ingredient> The glasses should be about four inches from the edge of the table. The glasses for port, <ingredient>Madeira,</ingredient> Burgundy, and the <emph rend="italic">liqueurs</emph> should be upon the <implement>sideboard,</implement> together with extra glasses of all kinds to replace any accidentally overturned or broken.</p>
<p>Also, upon the <implement>sideboard</implement> or table, there should be plenty of fresh napkins, plates, and silver, the <implement>finger-bowls</implement> and dishes which are to be used during the dessert, the cups and saucers for <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> cigars or cigarettes when there are 
 
<pb n="108" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=138"/>

gentlemen present, and the wines and <emph rend="italic">liqueurs</emph> which are not iced.</p>
<p>Before placing the dessert, crumbs can be best removed by using a large silver knife; it is better than a brush, which only scatters the crumbs about the cloth and over the floor. In some houses, the old custom still prevails of removing the cloth before the dessert is served, so as to place it upon the polished mahogany table: this implies ample attendance. The table must be bright enough to reflect every glint of light which falls on it; then, in the removal of the cloth, it must be rolled or folded from one end of the table to the other by a servant on either side of the table, and others must be near to assist them by raising and replacing the table-ornaments, otherwise the process is awkward and tedious. At best, it involves much reaching over the shoulders of the guests, unless they are seated far apart.</p>
<p>After the crumbs have been removed, or the cloth changed, the <implement>finger-bowls</implement> are put upon the table, and the dessert is served. A small colored or embroidered napkin is laid on a <implement>dessert-plate,</implement> usually of decorated china, and the glass bowl is set upon the napkin. Sometimes a small glass containing a little perfumed <ingredient>water</ingredient> is set in the bowl: at the end of the dinner this glass is raised to the lips to refresh them, and the fingers are dipped into the bowl. The dinner-napkin is used for drying the hands, and is then laid without folding at the side of the plate. Unless at very informal family dinners, fresh napkins are always laid. The embroidered napkins under the bowls are to be placed under them on the table-cloth, when the plate is required for the dessert. If the dessert-napkins are colored and of wash material, they are to be used if <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is served; otherwise the dinner-napkin remains in use. Upon the plate, by the side of the <implement>finger-bowl,</implement> the dessert silver is laid, a <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-knife and teaspoon, and a silver fork if the dessert includes any juicy large <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="109" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=139"/>

such as <ingredient>pears</ingredient> or <ingredient>pine-apple.</ingredient> The guest lays this silver upon the table, and places the bowl, with the <implement>doily</implement> under it, within easy reach. If there is a <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-napkin, it is laid ready for use; and, unless a fresh <ingredient>white</ingredient> napkin is served, the dinner-napkin remains upon the knees until the end of the dinner: when the <ingredient>white</ingredient> dessert-napkin is laid, the dinner-napkin is to be taken away before the service of the dessert. Other details in regard to the napkin are given where the table-linen is discussed.</p>
<p>When the frozen <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> or <ingredient>water</ingredient>-bottles are to be prepared at home, the following method will be found easy and satisfactory. Unless small <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> for individual use are desired, the ordinary glass ones will answer: the use of cut or pressed glass bottles is attended with the danger of breaking during the freezing. Smooth <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> are best, holding about a quart: they are filled with fresh <ingredient>water</ingredient> to the bottom of the <ingredient>neck,</ingredient> and set in a wooden tub containing enough freezing-mixture to reach two-thirds up the sides. The freezing-mixture is composed of three parts of pounded ice to one of <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> The <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> are covered first with a clean cloth, and then with a heavy blanket, and allowed to remain undisturbed until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is frozen. If they are left over night, as they sometimes are in summer, sufficient drainage must be insured to prevent the entrance of the melted freezing mixture to the <emph rend="italic">carafes.</emph></p>

<formula class="household">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">FLOWERS AT TABLE.</purpose>

FLOWERS will probably always hold favor as table decorations, because of their beauty and freshness; but the use of large and elaborate flower-stands, or high ornamental figures of <ingredient>sweetmeats</ingredient> and confectionery, <emph rend="italic">&#201;pergnes,</emph> or plate, should be deprecated. They obstruct the intercourse of the guests, which to be enjoyable must be unconstrained. In summer, a very effective centre-piece for the table may be formed by wreathing a block of ice with smilax, ivy, or ferns; of course, care must be taken to insure perfect drainage, or a sufficiently large receptacle to hold the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be placed under the ice, otherwise the tablecloth will be soiled. The size and shape of the table will decide the degree of ornamentation admissible.</p>
<p>A round table might be arranged somewhat after the following fashion, using only flowers for decoration. In the service <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> the small <implement>dessert-dishes</implement> and the relishes would be interspersed. A fine cloth being laid, the centre of the table would be filled with either a block of ice wreathed in vines or leaves, or a stand of dwarf foliage-plants, or a circular bed of flowers of some pronounced color, usually of one variety; next, in the outer circle, contrasting flowers, or small <implement>dessert-dishes</implement> and relishes harmoniously arranged so far as color and form are concerned; and at the edge of the table, the service of covers. In this 
 
<pb n="111" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=141"/>

plan no calculation is made for placing on the table the different dishes composing the dinner; when the service involves this, space should be left for the dishes, large enough to allow a margin of the cloth to show between the centre decoration and the dishes served.</p>
<p>When flowers are not in season, a centre may be made of a china figure supporting an open dish for <ingredient>fruits;</ingredient> other <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> and <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> may be dispersed in low dishes around the centre-piece, and beyond them the small relishes, varied with a few flowers or even leaves.</p>
<p>For a long table, when flowers are not abundant, the strip of colored plush or satin is very effective: it should be bordered with ivy, moss, or any trailing vine; smilax, <ingredient>blackberry</ingredient>-vines, woodbine, and honeysuckle are admirable for this purpose. When only moss or leaves are used, a few bright flowers or <ingredient>berries,</ingredient> placed at intervals, heighten the brilliancy of the effect. One of the loveliest of long-table decorations is a profusely flowering vine of honeysuckle, laid the entire length of the table. Another beautiful centre is an oval mass of <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and leaves, placed low upon the table, the middle of the mound being slightly elevated.</p>
<p>An exquisite summer centre-piece is a block of ice, wreathed in ferns, with an outer circle of <ingredient>water-lilies</ingredient> and their leaves and curling stems. But flowers of pronounced odors are sometimes objectionable. Low dishes filled with violets and pansies are most beautiful when arranged on a <ingredient>white</ingredient> cloth. A low <emph rend="italic">&#201;pergne,</emph> or a china figure supporting a basket, either to be filled with <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> and set in a broad circle of pansies, is very beautiful: flat dishes containing the sweets may be sunk among the flowers. <ingredient>Nasturtium</ingredient>-vines, with the leaves and flowers, are bright and effective. Of course the queen of all table-flowers is the rose, and the variety is innumerable. In flower-decoration, there should be one predominating color.</p>
 
<pb n="112" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=142"/>

<p>In summer each gentleman is supplied with a <emph rend="italic">boutonni&#232;re,</emph> and each lady with a corsage-bouquet. The bouquets are tied with ribbons of contrasting colors, and a large pin is stuck into the cloth for the purpose of fastening the flowers to the dress.</p>
<p>At elaborate entertainments, when it is desired to present the ladies with some souvenir, bouquet clasp-pins may be substituted for the ordinary large pin, or the large pin may be made of gold or silver. Very pretty silver pins can be bought for from fifty cents to one dollar, and more fanciful ones and bouquet-pins for from one dollar upwards, according to their style of ornamentation.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic">MENUS, OR BILLS OF FARE.</purpose>

In the choice of <emph rend="italic">menu</emph>-cards, much taste may be displayed. Extreme ornamentation should be avoided, and the names of the dishes written legibly with ink, either in the centre of the ornamentation, when space is left there, or upon the plain side of the card. When small cards are used, one should be laid at each place: this is desirable when the number of guests is large, for then on the reverse of the card can be written the name of the guest who is to occupy the seat. When large <emph rend="italic">menu</emph>-cards are used, one answers for four or five guests. The large cards are more elaborate, and are often framed flat, or set on low ornamental easels. The names of the different wines are to be placed opposite the dishes with which they are to be served. The cook and head waiter should both have a copy of the bill of fare, so that they may know when to serve the various dishes composing the dinner.</p>
<p>The ability to compose a bill of fare judiciously implies taste and discrimination. The fact should always be remembered, that a heavy soup will so far cloy the appetite as to render one indifferent to the rest of the dinner, while 
 
<pb n="113" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=143"/>

a clear soup refreshes and prepares one for the enjoyment of the succeeding solids. The <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> should not be substantial enough to satisfy hunger entirely: the relishes will then stimulate the appetite for the heavier dishes. The service of Roman punch before the roast refreshes the palate, and prepares the more perfect enjoyment of the succeeding dishes: it is as necessary to the service of a good dinner as <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> is with the plain salad. When <ingredient>olives</ingredient> are on the table, they go well with <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> of <ingredient>game;</ingredient> French <ingredient>chestnuts</ingredient> are excellent with poultry; and <ingredient>almonds,</ingredient> blanched and roasted with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> are enjoyable with <ingredient>Madeira</ingredient> or <ingredient>sherry</ingredient> before the sweet <emph rend="italic">entremets.</emph> Only a plain <ingredient>vegetable salad</ingredient> should accompany the roast or <ingredient>game,</ingredient> and a bit of any <ingredient>old cheese</ingredient> may be passed with the salad. <ingredient>Cheese straws</ingredient> or <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> crusts may be served with the salad. Although the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> belongs with the salad, it enters into some delicate dishes, such as <emph rend="italic">fondus</emph> and <emph rend="italic">souffl&#201;s,</emph> which may come to the table either after the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> or soup, as relishes, or before the large sweets at dessert, previous to the service of the <ingredient>nuts</ingredient> and <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> Then comes the dessert, placed as already indicated. If the dinner is small, it is perfectly permissible for the hostess to make the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> at the table, or it may be served in the drawing-room later.</p>
<p>Even with the best-chosen <emph rend="italic">menu,</emph> the success of a dinner depends on the skill of the cook. A good cook appreciates the value of sauces, and will give much care to their preparation, and, above all, will endeavor to <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> the natural flavors of the different dishes. All mingling of flavors is objectionable, except in sauces and salads.</p>
<p>The details of the bill of fare are as follows:--</p>
<p>THE SHELLFISH (<emph rend="italic">Hu&#238;tres</emph>) includes small raw <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and Little <ingredient>Neck</ingredient> or hard-shell <ingredient>clams,</ingredient> on the half-shell; at the same time, <ingredient>brown bread</ingredient> cut very thin and buttered, and cut <ingredient>lemons,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> and sharp table-sauces are placed upon the table.</p>
 
<pb n="114" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=144"/>

<p>THE SOUP (<emph rend="italic">Potage</emph>) is varied according to the character of the dinner. If it is choice, no matter how small it is, there are always two soups; one a perfectly clear soup, or <emph rend="italic">consomm&#201;,</emph> and the other a rich, thick one, such as a <emph rend="italic">bisque</emph> or <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> A thick cut of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> or a roll with crisp crust, is placed upon the napkin when the cover is laid, to be used after the shellfish.</p>
<p>THE FISH (<emph rend="italic">Poisson</emph>) may be of any large kind, boiled and served with a good <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> and plain boiled <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>. If the dinner is large or elaborate, there should be two kinds of <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> one boiled, and the other baked and served with a garnish, or small <ingredient>fish</ingredient> with a <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> and garnish, and some special dish of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>, such as Parisienne or Hollandaise. If shellfish is used here, the dish should be large and hot.</p>
<p>THE RELISHES (<emph rend="italic">Hors-d'&#x153;uvre</emph>), which are placed upon the table in the American dinner and the service <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> include all kinds of table-sauces and catsups, <ingredient>salted almonds,</ingredient> <ingredient>pickles,</ingredient> <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> caviare, <emph rend="italic">vinaigrettes,</emph> small cold <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> such as <emph rend="italic">bouch&#201;es</emph> and <emph rend="italic">p&#226;t&#232;-de-foie-gras,</emph> pickled <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and small <ingredient>tongues,</ingredient> and individual escalops.</p>
<p>THE REMOVES (or <emph rend="italic">Relev&#201;s</emph>) consist of boiled, baked, and braised <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> poultry, and large <ingredient>game,</ingredient> large <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>game,</ingredient> and <ingredient>fish</ingredient> pies, and large cold joints, such as <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> and <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> generally served with a garnish of vegetables; the remove at a small dinner may consist of an elaborately dressed cold <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> if the regular <ingredient>fish</ingredient> service has been omitted.</p>
<p>THE SIDE-DISHES (<emph rend="italic">Entr&#201;es</emph>) are the small hot <ingredient>meats</ingredient> garnished, such as cutlets, chops breaded or larded, <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> with sauces garnished, small <ingredient>meats</ingredient> and poultry larded, <ingredient>sweet-breads</ingredient> garnished, <emph rend="italic">fricandeaux, fricass&#201;es, rago&#251;ts, escalopes,</emph> all hot; hot raised pies, <emph rend="italic">p&#226;t&#201;s,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">rissoles,</emph> combination salads of vegetables, salads with <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise,</emph> such as <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> and <ingredient>lobster;</ingredient> in brief, any dish in size less than a joint or a roast.</p>
 
<pb n="115" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=145"/>

<p>ROMAN PUNCH (<emph rend="italic">Sorbet</emph>).--There are many delicious ices served under the general name of Roman punch, all having a combination of frozen <ingredient>fruit-sherbet</ingredient> and some fine <emph rend="italic">liqueur,</emph> <ingredient>cordial,</ingredient> <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> or <ingredient>spirit;</ingredient> served in the midst of the dinner, when the palate needs the sense of refreshment they give, they prepare it for renewed enjoyment, and render it capable of appreciating the intense flavor of the roast and the <emph rend="italic">bouquet</emph> of the Burgundy or <ingredient>champagne,</ingredient> that follow them.</p>
<p>THE ROAST (<emph rend="italic">R&#244;te</emph>).--For family dinners, the roast may be a joint of any <ingredient>meat</ingredient> preferred; but for special occasions it should be of <ingredient>venison,</ingredient> larded hare, or some large game-bird. If <ingredient>wild duck</ingredient> is served, there should be more than one, because only the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> is carved; when canvas-backs are used, half a <ingredient>breast</ingredient> cut in one piece is served to each guest. Smaller birds, either roasted or broiled, may be served in this course. All <ingredient>game</ingredient> should be underdone. A garnish of watercress or <ingredient>celery</ingredient> is used with birds, and always <ingredient>currant-jelly</ingredient> and special sauces with <ingredient>venison</ingredient> and <ingredient>hare.</ingredient></p>
<p>SALAD (<emph rend="italic">Salade</emph>).--A green salad is the proper accompaniment of the roast; it may be of watercress, <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> chiccory, <emph rend="italic">escarole,</emph> <ingredient>burnet,</ingredient> <ingredient>nasturtium</ingredient> (leaves, fruit, and flowers), <ingredient>corn-salad</ingredient>, <ingredient>dandelion,</ingredient> <ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient> <ingredient>fennel,</ingredient> <ingredient>mint,</ingredient> young <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> and any of the green <ingredient>sweet herbs</ingredient>: the five first-named varieties are the most generally used. Sometimes <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> and <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> are served here; but they more properly belong, the <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> with the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> with a <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise</emph> among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es.</emph> The best dressing for a green salad is of <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient>: a salad with <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise</emph> belongs among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> as do the salads of cold cooked vegetables. A little old, rich <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> may be served with the green salad if desired.</p>
<p>SECOND-COURSE SIDE-DISHES (<emph rend="italic">Entremets</emph>).--After the roast and its accompanying green salad, it is customary to serve hot vegetables dressed with sauces, hot <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="116" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=146"/>

or game pies, <emph rend="italic">croquettes</emph> and fritters with sauces, <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> in elaborate form with sauces, large cold side-dishes; and the second-course sweets such as <emph rend="italic">croquettes,</emph> charlottes, <emph rend="italic">croquantes, timbales,</emph> cold puddings in moulds, hot puddings with sauces, pastries, moulded <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> and creams, <emph rend="italic">meringues, souffl&#201;s,</emph> and <emph rend="italic">macedoines.</emph></p>
<p>DESSERT (<emph rend="italic">Des'sert</emph>).--The dessert consists of the small cold sweets, such as <emph rend="italic">&#201;clairs,</emph> fancy cakes, <emph rend="italic">nougats,</emph> confectionery, <ingredient>candied fruits,</ingredient> <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> individual moulded <ingredient>jellies,</ingredient> ices, and creams, <emph rend="italic">glac&#201;s</emph> and <emph rend="italic">caf&#201; noir.</emph> When it is divided in two parts, the dishes called <emph rend="italic">glac&#201;s</emph> are served first; these include every sweet which can be crystallized, frozen or iced: after them comes the dessert proper, composed of candied and dry <ingredient>preserved fruits,</ingredient> <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">bonbons,</emph> and little fancy cakes, or <emph rend="italic">petit-fours,</emph> and the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE SERVICE OF DISHES.</purpose>

After the dinner-table is properly arranged in accordance with any chosen style, the service of the dinner becomes the matter of importance. Unless the various dishes are acceptably presented, the finest cookery loses its value; and if the attendants do not know how to carry out the details of the service deftly and quietly, the comfort of the entire repast is destroyed. If strange waiters are brought into the house for any special occasion, they should be made perfectly conversant with all the resources and facilities of the establishment. There should be a clear understanding as to just what is to be done by the servants in the kitchen, and those in the dining-room; and, if possible, matters should be so planned that the waiters do not have to leave the room. All the dishes, and those parts of the dinner which need not be hot, should be in the dining-room before the meal is served, either upon the dinner-table or upon the <implement>side-board</implement> or side-table. Then, if the cook or kitchen-maid
 
<pb n="117" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=147"/>

brings the hot dishes to the door or into an adjoining-room, there need be no unnecessary delay.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> or <ingredient>clams</ingredient> on the half-shell are to be kept on the ice until just before the dinner is announced; they are then to be arranged on appropriate plates, and set at each cover, the <implement>oyster-plate</implement> being placed on a large dinner-plate, which is to be removed with it when the hot plate is placed for the <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> A bit of <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> is to be put in the centre of the <implement>oyster-plate</implement>, six half-shells being served on each plate (except in California, where one can consume at least a dozen of the small delicious native bivalves); the small <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-fork is laid either upon the plate, or beside it on the table. After the shellfish are eaten, the guest leaves the fork upon the plate so that it can be removed with it. Plates of <ingredient>brown bread,</ingredient> cut very thin and buttered, are placed upon the table with the shellfish, and removed with them. If this <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is intended for use with the salad, it should be served in one compartment of a fancy basket or dish; the other divisions containing <ingredient>biscuit,</ingredient> <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> <ingredient>old cheese,</ingredient> <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> and small relishes. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> intended to be used with the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and salad should be made up in small fancy pats or balls and iced. The basket containing these articles should be removed from the table with the salad.</p>
<p>All plates are removed, and the various dishes passed, at the guest's left: the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is poured at the right. Hot plates are served with all the dishes except <emph rend="italic">foie-gras,</emph> caviare, salads, and the cold sweets.</p>
<p>Great care should be exercised in preparing the dishes in the kitchen, and in bringing them to the table in a perfectly <ingredient>neat</ingredient> condition. The soup should not fill the <implement>tureen</implement> so far as to endanger spilling. The dishes for <ingredient>fish</ingredient> should be suited in size and shape to the contents. If the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is boiled, it should be served unbroken, on a napkin laid in the appropriate platter, and garnished with a few sprigs of fresh <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="118" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=148"/>

or slices of <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> being served in a <implement>sauce-boat</implement>: if <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> is served on the dish with the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> only enough to cover the centre of the dish should be used, and the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> laid on it; the rest is served in a <implement>sauce-boat.</implement> <emph rend="italic">Entr&#201;es</emph> should be very neatly arranged with the proper garnishes, with <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> enough to surround them, but not to reach to the edge of the dish. Very little <ingredient>gravy,</ingredient> or none at all, should be on the dish with joints, as it is likely to be spilled in carving; and the dish should be deep enough to contain all that may flow from the cut <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
<p>In the service of English and American dinners, the soup, salad, and large sweets are to be placed before the hostess; the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> and <ingredient>game</ingredient> which require carving, before the host. If two dishes of a kind are served at a large dinner, one is to be put before each. The relishes and small sweets are placed in different parts of the table; and the vegetables are passed by the servants, after the large dishes are served, a spoon and fork being in each dish, so that the guest can easily help himself. When two large dishes are served at once, there is always the possibility that one will be spoiled by waiting until it is required; and, besides, it is then necessary that both hosts should be expert carvers. In the dinner served <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> the carving is all done at the side-table by the servants. Sometimes the dishes are placed on the table a moment, for the approbation of the master or mistress of the house, and then taken away to be carved; but this involves delay. In this form of service, the plates are laid between each course, and the guests help themselves as the waiters pass the dishes after they are carved.</p>
<p>In treating of the service of dinners, some general reference has been made to the different methods of placing the dishes upon the table: here the full details will be given of the three forms of service in vogue in this country and abroad,--the English and American, and the service <emph rend="italic">&#224; la</emph> 
 
<pb n="119" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=149"/>

<emph rend="italic">Russe</emph> which is much favored by caterers. With the English service, much labor falls upon the hosts in the way of carving and serving, but the effect is hospitable in the extreme. In the dinner <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> every care falls upon the servants, but this necessitates a greater number than any other form of service. The American dinner-service is not very trying to the hosts, especially if dishes are chosen which can easily be dispensed: the effect is homelike, and one well-trained servant can attend eight or ten guests.</p>
</formula>

<formula class="servants">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE ENGLISH DINNER-SERVICE.</purpose>

In serving a dinner according to the approved English method, the table must first be laid with a <implement>cotton-flannel</implement> or <implement>baize</implement> cloth, so that the heat of the of the dishes cannot affect its polished mahogany surface; even when an ordinary wood table is used, this cloth gives a good body to those laid over it; the dessert-cloth of delicately tinted damask is next spread; and above that, one or more <ingredient>white</ingredient> cloths, according to the number of courses which are to be served, the cloth being removed after each course is served. The covers are then laid for the first course, including the necessary <ingredient>wine</ingredient>-glasses for the wines to be served during the course; the relishes and condiments for the course are placed; and the flower-decorations, which are generally massive. Several dishes placed upon the table at once constitute a course; the largest before the host and hostess, to be carved by them and put upon plates passed from their left to the left hand of the guests by the waiters. When there is a large staff of servants, the butler, who is in charge of them, makes the first service, and then relegates it to his assistants, and attends to the wines. The soups, salads, and large sweets are set before the hostess; the large dishes of <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and <ingredient>game,</ingredient> which require carving, are placed before the host; the relishes, vegetables, and small sweets are set upon the table, 
 
<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=150"/>

each with its appropriate course, and passed by the servants after the large dishes are served. When two large dishes are served in the same course, the least difficult is set before the hostess. The chief disadvantage of this form of service is that one of the large dishes is apt to become cold before it is served to the guests; and, besides, it requires that both host and hostess should be expert carvers. As each course is finished, the servants entirely clear the table, remove the cloth, and then arrange the table afresh for the next course, as already described in the chapter on Laying and Serving the Table. Sometimes in a dinner of only two courses, the same <ingredient>white</ingredient> cloth serves until dessert, and then all the cloths are removed, and the dessert proper, of <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> and <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> is placed upon the polished mahogany.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE SERVICE OF DINNER &#224; LA RUSSE.</purpose>

This form of service is popular, because the table is made very attractive by the pretty dishes which it permits to be placed there; and, besides, it entails but little care upon the hosts; well-trained servants can easily manage all the details, leaving the hosts free to devote themselves to their guests. In laying the table, one white cloth is placed over a <implement>cotton-flannel</implement> one, and a low centre-piece of plate, crystal, or fine china, filled with flowers, occupies the middle of the table. Bright-colored dishes containing relishes, <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> small sweets, <ingredient>biscuit,</ingredient> <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> and <emph rend="italic">bonbons,</emph> are dispersed about the table; dressed salads, jellied <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> if small, may be used, but no hot or greasy dishes are permissible; flowers always form part of the ornamentation, and <emph rend="italic">boutonni&#232;res</emph> and corsage-bouquets may be laid beside each cover. As the table is not cleared during the dinner, there is a good opportunity for producing beautiful effects. The effects will largely depend upon the prevailing colors, which should be harmonious, and chosen with some reference to the appearance of the dishes which are to be placed upon the table during the progress of the dinner. Many dishes, especially <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> are very ornamental; and others may be included in the dessert.</p>
<p>In planning a dinner <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> the hostess can choose dishes that can be carved without disarranging them before they are sent into the dining-room, or at the side-table by the servants, and then passed without any supervision on her part. Some of the dishes illustrated in the chapter on carving will exemplify this idea; other suitable ones will be found among the garnished <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> or side-dishes. For more than ten guests, there should be a servant for each side of the table, and the service can be greatly expedited if a third follows the passing of each large dish with its appropriate 
 
<pb n="122" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=152"/>

vegetable. All the dishes should contain a fork and spoon for serving them; and the waiters must either wear white gloves, or cover the thumb, where it touches the rim of the dish, with a clean napkin. The same care must be exercised in laying a plate before a guest. Of course the napkin, gloves, and hands must be scrupulously clean. In this service, a fresh plate containing a knife and fork is laid before each guest as soon as the preceding course is finished: the guest lays the knife and fork upon the tablecloth. The plate of the hostess is changed last at each course.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">THE AMERICAN DINNER.</hd>
<p>This form of service combines the advantages of the two already described, and still <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> the genial hospitality implied by the personal service of the guests by the hosts. None of the principal dishes are difficult to serve, and placing them upon the table greatly adds to its pleasant aspect. The vegetables are brought in hot, at the moment of service, when the large dishes have been placed upon the table, and are at once passed by one of the waiters. This partial service by the hosts enables the waiters to serve more rapidly. All the dishes are brought to the dining-room door by the cook or kitchen-maid, so that the waiters need not leave the room; and as all the necessary dishes, silver, <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> and the little dinner accessories, are placed upon the <implement>sideboard</implement> or in the <implement>hot-closet</implement> before the dinner is announced, there need be no such vexatious delay as occurs when the attendants are obliged to leave the room in search of something required upon the table. This routine, once understood, can easily be carried out, and prevents all confusion: it suits both plain and fine dinners, and enables one well-trained servant to wait upon a dozen guests with ease.</p>
<p>The table is laid as for the dinner <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> with the <implement>cotton-flannel</implement> and the dinner-cloth, which may be of plain white damask, or as elaborate as the fancy dictates. All the covers, relishes, confectionery, and small sweets are arranged in harmony with the decoration of flowers. The <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> of iced <ingredient>water,</ingredient> the wines which allow of decanting, and the shellfish are placed before the dinner is announced. Directly the guests are seated, the first course of soup and <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> if there is but one service of each, is placed before the host and hostess; when the service includes two soups, or two dishes of any course, one is placed before the host, and the other before the hostess, the latter being given that which is 
 
<pb n="126" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=156"/>

the least difficult to serve. When there is a double service, there must be two servants at least. As each plate is supplied by the host, the servant takes it from the left hand, and carries it to the left of the guest, together with the appropriate vegetable or relish. When <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is used, it is poured from the right hand of the guest, in the intervals of service of the different courses. Directly all the guests are served, and the host has taken a portion from any dish, it is at once removed from the table, and replaced by the succeeding course. As each guest signifies his readiness to have his plate removed,--and he does this by laying the knife and fork side by side across the middle of the plate, with the handles to the right,--the waiter takes it away, and replaces it with a hot plate, and another knife and fork appropriate to the coming service, unless these are already upon the table. The knife and fork are upon the plate, and the guest at once lays them upon the table. As the waiter brings a plate containing a fresh service, he takes the guest's plate back to the host. After a vegetable or hot <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> has been passed, the dish containing it is set upon the <implement>sideboard,</implement> ready to be taken away. In a dinner of several courses, it is unusual for a guest to ask for any dish a second time; but at a small family dinner the sauces and vegetables may be placed upon the table until the course to which they belong is removed. The plates of the host and hostess are taken away at the conclusion of each course.</p>
<p>When the dessert is reached, all the glasses are taken away except the water-tumbler and the glass of the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> which the guest chooses to use during dessert; and the crumbs are removed from the cloth, with a broad-bladed silver knife, to a plate or small <implement>salver</implement> held in the left hand of the waiter. The knife is better for this purpose than a crumb-brush. The <implement>dessert-plate,</implement> containing a <implement>finger-bowl</implement> and dessert knife and fork, is then set before each guest, 
 
<pb n="127" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=157"/>

who at once removes the <implement>finger-bowl</implement> and its <implement>doily,</implement> and the knife and fork, to the table; leaving the plate ready for the waiter either to take to the hostess, or for use for the small sweets. <ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> can be served at table or in the drawing-room; and <ingredient>tea</ingredient> an hour after dinner, to the guests who remain, or to others who arrive when an evening at home follows the dinner.</p>
<p>The bill of fare following comprises a double service; except in the courses composed of <ingredient>terrapin</ingredient> and canvas-backs, when it would be gastronomic heresy to suggest the choice of any other dish. When either of these dainties is not available, or is not desired, they can be replaced by any chosen <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;e</emph> or roast. A <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise</emph> <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> should be upon the table, with the choicest <ingredient>white celery,</ingredient> to use with canvas-back. Directions are given elsewhere for carving <ingredient>ducks,</ingredient> but a few words here will not be out of place. When the abundance of <ingredient>duck</ingredient> permits half the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> to be served to each guest, the matter is simple; but when the supply is limited, the carving becomes a fine art: then several deep cuts should be quickly made on each side of the <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> down to the <ingredient>bone,</ingredient> but no slice removed until all are cut, for a point is made of serving canvas-back very hot; the small bit of flesh called the "<ingredient>oyster</ingredient>" in poultry, which lies in a little hollow of the back-bone, between the <ingredient>leg</ingredient> and the <ingredient>wing,</ingredient> is considered by epicures the most delicious morsel in the entire bird. The use of <ingredient>melon</ingredient> at an early stage of the dinner is of course optional; but either <ingredient>pine-apple</ingredient> iced and without <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> <ingredient>cantelope,</ingredient> or <ingredient>watermelon</ingredient> is refreshing after a heavy soup or <ingredient>fish;</ingredient> and both the latter make delicious salads, either with plain salad-dressing or with <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise,</emph> as also does choice Florida <ingredient>grape fruit.</ingredient> In many of the larger cities the tropical <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> called the alligator <ingredient>pear</ingredient> is sold: it is a favorite salad in the East and West Indies, combined with <emph rend="italic">mayonnaise;</emph> and is also eaten with <ingredient>lime-juice</ingredient> or <ingredient>wine</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> at dessert.</p>

<p>Although the double course is given in all these bills of fare, it is neither imperative nor advisable except for large dinners: a simple, well-chosen <emph rend="italic">menu,</emph> of a few favorite dishes, one or two delicate wines when they are desired, or, for a family dinner, <ingredient>cider</ingredient> or some light malt beverage, will often prove more acceptable than an elaborate repast. An excellent little dinner, possible at any season, may be arranged somewhat as follows; several dishes are named for each course, so that the choice may be made of such dishes as the market affords. Wines are named; but, as already indicated, their use is entirely a matter of choice.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">DINNER WINES.</hd>
<p>While there is no absolute rule which is invariably followed in the choice of dinner-wines, custom indicates the lightest as most acceptable at the beginning of the dinner; the more stimulating, full-bodied wines are preferable from the <emph rend="italic">relev&#201;s</emph> or removes to the roast; sweet, rich wines like the fine Burgundies and champagnes are suitable for the second course; the <emph rend="italic">liqueurs</emph> and cordials are approved with the dessert; and a dash of Cognac for the <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> or a <emph rend="italic">demi-tasse</emph> with the <emph rend="italic">caf&#201; noir,</emph> end the dinner satisfactorily. Sometimes at small, choice dinners, <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">glac&#201;</emph> or <emph rend="italic">frapp&#201;</emph> is served throughout; this <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> is frozen in the original bottles, in the same manner as the frozen <emph rend="italic">carafes,</emph> for about two hours, or until semi-liquid; it is then poured into wide-mouthed flagons, which can be closed with a <implement>glass stopper,</implement> and served at once; the half-frozen <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> will retain its consistency in the bottles or flagons for about fifteen or twenty minutes after it is removed from the freezer.</p>
<p>As has already been said, the number of wines served depends upon the character of the dinner. At a small dinner, a good Bordeaux <ingredient>wine</ingredient> may be served throughout, flagons of it being placed upon the table slightly chilled;<ref target="n1" height="superscript">*</ref> <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> of <ingredient>water</ingredient> and cracked ice should also be on the table. A more pleasant effect is produced by serving <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> with the roast, the claret flagons remaining on the table. The best succession of wines at a small dinner is a <ingredient>white wine,</ingredient> such as Sauterne, or <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> as far as the <emph rend="italic">entre&#201;s;</emph> then claret to the roast; and, with and after the roast, iced <ingredient>champagne.</ingredient> As many glasses are placed before each guest as there are wines; and they should be, as Ruskin says, "radiantly clean." Colored glasses are used for <ingredient>white</ingredient> and Rhine wines. Guests who take no <ingredient>wine</ingredient> may either turn down the glasses, or by a sign forbid the attendant filling 
 
<pb n="131" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=161"/>

them; when the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is poured but not drank, the fact is very conspicuous. The wines are poured from the right hand of the guest, the glasses not being quite filled: the servant mentions the name of each <ingredient>wine</ingredient> before he pours it, so that the guest may decline it if he wishes to do so. At a family dinner, <ingredient>ale</ingredient> may be served with <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese.</ingredient></p>
<p>At an elaborate dinner, a good succession of wines is as follows: upon the table, <implement>decanters</implement> of chilled <ingredient>sherry</ingredient> and <ingredient>Madeira,</ingredient> one of each being near enough to the host to permit him to pass them; a good Bordeaux or claret in flagons, the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> having been slightly chilled<ref target="n1" height="superscript">*</ref> before pouring it from the bottles. All the wines which are iced, and poured from the original bottles, should be held with a napkin. The Burgundies should be about the temperature of the room in winter, and of the outer air in summer; the Sauternes should be slightly cooled, and poured from the original bottles. All the sparkling wines should be in <implement>coolers,</implement> in the original bottles; a bottle of <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> in a <implement>cooler</implement> should be on the floor at the right side of the host. With the shellfish a white Burgundy or good <ingredient>Sauterne</ingredient>, such as Chablis or Ch&#226;teau Yquem, is most acceptable; the same wines, or <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> with the soup; if the soup is <ingredient>turtle</ingredient> or <ingredient>terrapin,</ingredient> punch or <ingredient>old Madeira</ingredient> is called for; with the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> a good Sauterne, Moselle, or hock; when large removes or <emph rend="italic">relev&#201;s</emph> are served, an <ingredient>old Madeira</ingredient> is in place; with the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> the claret comes, and after them the Roman punch or <emph rend="italic">sorbet;</emph> if any <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is served here, it should be Burgundy, which may remain during the service of the roast unless it is replaced with <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> iced in <implement>coolers;</implement> with the large sweets, old port or <ingredient>Madeira</ingredient> is appropriate, and then all the large wine-glasses except the one in use should be removed. A warm <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is required when there are several iced sweets, and with ice-cream Canton <ingredient>ginger</ingredient> is acceptable; with the candied 
 
<pb n="132" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=162"/>

<ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and <ingredient>nuts,</ingredient> the <emph rend="italic">liqueurs</emph> and cordials are placed, with small glasses; and <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> is served with black <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient> If any of the dinner-wines re-appear at dessert, fresh glasses are set upon the table with them, and a bottle is always placed near enough to the host for him to pass it.</p>
<p id="n1" size="smaller"><ref height="superscript">*</ref>The chilling of wines is accomplished by keeping them in a cool cellar, or in summer by placing the bottles in freshly drawn <ingredient>water,</ingredient> not ice-water. Chilling is not icing. While an ordinary Bordeaux or table claret is generally preferred by Americans slightly chilled, epicures are inclined to treat their choice clarets like Burgundy; in cold weather the <ingredient>wine</ingredient> may remain upon the <implement>sideboard</implement> in the dining-room until it acquires the temperature of the room; or, if there is not time enough for that, the bottle may be placed for two or three minutes in a pail of <ingredient>lukewarm water;</ingredient> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must not be hot, only warm enough to develop the aroma of the <ingredient>wine.</ingredient> Some Americans spoil the flavor of claret by putting lumps of ice in the glasses containing it; when it is liked very cold it is best as claret-cup or punch.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">THE ETIQUETTE OF DINNERS.</hd>
<p>THE selection of guests for a dinner should be thoughtfully made. Not only should social obligations and personal preferences be consulted, but also the individual characteristics of the guests; for a disagreeable neighbor can destroy the entire enjoyment of the repast. A dinner is not the affair of a moment: it implies prolonged association. At a luncheon, where the time spent at table is short, at a garden-party, where change of companionship is possible, at a dance, where the favorite partner can be secured at least once, no such nice discrimination is demanded, upon the part of the host, as at the dinner-table, where guests are placed in close proximity for hours. It is true that no introductions need take place, except between guests who are to go down together, when they are not already acquaintances, or where there is on the part of the guests a natural desire for introduction to some distinguished person present; but one takes the fact for granted that every guest at a friend's table is a desirable companion, and every one is at liberty to enter into conversation without a formal introduction. Although such desultory intercourse does not entail subsequent recognition, it is the duty of the host to make sure that the passing intercourse leaves no unwelcome claims upon his guests. Then, too, those persons should be placed together whose conversation is likely to strike upon congenial 
 
<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=164"/>

topics in the intervals of well-served courses. The guests see so little of the hosts, after the first salutation, that they are in a measure bound to replace themselves in the arrangement of their guests. While one would not place a chatterbox without taste beside a man inclined to pay the choice dish of the dinner the tribute of silent appreciation, nothing can be more wearisome than a long, elaborate dinner beside a person without smile or voice. It is true that a <emph rend="italic">gourmand</emph> may find consolation in well-cooked dishes, but it is not in every house that these are served. To place a flippant guest beside an earnest one, a commonplace one next a poet, is to intensify the misery of <emph rend="italic">ennui.</emph> The dinner-giver does not always invite "minds" to the feast, but the fact that guests have minds should not be forgotten.</p>
<p>On the part of the host, a dinner-invitation implies a desire for a certain social intimacy which is not involved in any other form of entertainment. One may give pleasant assurances of social happiness in the formal interchange of calls, or the slightly more personal intercourse of prolonged receptions or of evening affairs: these are agreeable ways of paying one's social debts. But to ask a friend to dinner means friendliness indeed; for this reason, a dinner-invitation should be accepted only from those whose friendship is welcomed. It should always be returned during the social season; that is, before people separate for the summer: if the recipient has not an establishment which admits of giving a dinner in return, a ride or drive in the country, or a good restaurant-dinner or a theatre-party in the city, is considered a social equivalent. There should be no delay in answering a dinner invitation definitely: this gives the hostess an opportunity to fill the guest's place if the hospitality is declined. If the invitation is accepted, punctuality to the hour fixed for the dinner is imperative on the part of the guest. The tact of a lady is to be appreciated, who, after 
 
<pb n="135" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=165"/>

an unforeseen hinderance, reached the house of her entertainers just as the last of the guests were entering the dining-room; she dropped her wraps in the entrance-hall where her escort left his hat, and entered the dining-room with him at once, to the surprise and gratification of her hosts. The immediate acknowledgment of an acceptance to a dinner is, in the city a call within three days after the dinner, unless there is marked intimacy, in which case a longer time may be allowed to elapse; but no circumstance of ordinary consequence should set aside this social form, even among intimate friends, for these little courtesies are the graces of friendship. In the country, where it is not easy to get about, more latitude in point of time is permissible; unless an immediate return of hospitality is contemplated, any reasonable time may elapse before the call of acknowledgment is made.</p>
<p>The most enjoyable dinners are those where every one is at ease. Given the fact that the selection of the guests is perfect, their number should not be greater for a private dinner than the hostess can render all requisite courtesies to. Then, too, every care should be taken, previous to the dinner, to insure absolute ease on the part of the hosts. The comfort of guests depends upon equal and perfect service, as much as upon excellent cookery. As has been said already, one well-trained servant can attend to ten or twelve guests with the American dinner or the service <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe;</emph> but if the service is English, or if the number of guests is larger, there should be one or more other servants; and for elaborate dinners a butler should attend to the wine, direct the general table-routine, and, when not actually engaged, stand beside the host or hostess and watch to make sure that no person is unserved, because it is exceedingly awkward for a guest to ask for attention. The hostess so largely depends upon the servants for ease during the progress of 
 
<pb n="136" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=166"/>

the dinner, that she should, before it begins, make sure that they are entirely conversant with the wants of guests and the capacity of the establishment. This point is especially essential when temporary attendants are brought in: they should be well informed concerning all the facilities of the house which can in any way affect the comfort of the guests. These details of service as closely affect the perfection of dinner-giving as does the deportment of the hostess when she stands ready to receive her guests.</p>
<p>If the resources of the establishment are limited, a perfectly quiet entertainment should be given, the requirements of which come within the capacity of the household. A good hostess never inflicts the chance of failure upon her friends, and never makes experiments with her guests. Her servants know just what they have to do, and do not either cause delay by being unprepared, or make a noisy haste in performing their duties. If any accident occurs at the table, they know how to remedy it quietly; and they do every thing necessary to the comfort of the hour, without prompting. If the hostess knows that her servant will spread a fresh napkin over sauce spilled upon the cloth from a dish, or cover a claret-stain with salt, and conceal it with a napkin, she will naturally be easier than if she thinks such possible mishaps must go unremedied; in a word, if she feels sure of her service, she can give every thought to the entertainment of her guests. All this is very easy to suggest: it is possible to accomplish if the hostess has tact and management, and sufficient good sense to limit her social ambition by her own ability to carry out her plans. She will never attempt to exceed her means in dispensing hospitality: her table appointments will be abundant and suitable, even if they are simple. Her choice of dishes will be confined to those which she knows can be well made at home, or she will call in competent outside help to insure success in 
 
<pb n="137" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=167"/>

specialties. She will never affront her guests by serving a dish that is not absolutely good; and, unless for very formal occasions, she will place before them delicacies such as she is famous for making or ordering. Unless they are intimate friends, she will not urge them to partake of her fare, or invite comments upon it; but she can none the less stamp her dinners with her own individuality. The novice in dinner-giving should confine her first efforts within small bounds, beginning with few dishes, a very simple service, and a small number of guests; as she gains the confidence which follows frequent efforts, she can safely extend her hospitality; but she should take care that it never becomes ostentatious. Efforts to make a lavish display are vulgar. The model hostess gives well-chosen guests the best of her fare, and so marks her superiority; but the <emph rend="italic">parvenue</emph> exhausts the market to overload a table, and yet fails to create enjoyable dinners.</p>
<p>The formal dinner-invitation is a courtesy which a guest even of intimate standing has a right to expect from the hostess: it may either be written upon fine stationery, or engraved in script. The prevailing form is:--</p>
<p rend="italic" align="center">Mr. &#38; Mrs...........<lb/>request the company of<lb/>Mr. &#38; Mrs. ............<lb/>Company at dinner.<lb/>January Second, at Eight O'clock.<lb/>No. 500 Madison Avenue.<lb/>The favor of an answer is requested.<lb/></p>
<ednote>The text above appears inside of a box, in the form of an invitation.</ednote>
<p>A written answer should be returned directly the invitation is received, using the same personal form that appears in the invitation. If the invitation is accepted, and any circumstance 
 
<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=168"/>

arises to prevent attendance, the hostess should be informed at once; but no trivial affair should be allowed to interfere. Formal invitations and replies to dinner-invitations should be sent by hand: other invitations may go by post. After a dinner a call is imperative: a card is not a proper acknowledgment. Invitations to dinners of more than ten persons should go out two weeks in advance of the <ingredient>date</ingredient> chosen. A husband is never invited without his wife, or <emph rend="italic">vice versa,</emph> unless one is known to be an invalid or out of society, except where there is sufficient intimacy to warrant this departure from formality when some expected guest disappoints at the last moment: the affair should always be clearly understood even then.</p>
<p>The social duties of the hostess are too clearly defined to admit of any deviation from them; but according to the number of her guests, and the degree of intimacy with them, she may give them more or less personal attention,--the fact being understood, that there is ample attendance to insure every one's comfort; after that, she may permit herself to take some degree of pleasure in the society of her special favorites, although she never may give any one but the guest of honor such attention as to be conspicuous. At least half an hour before the time named for dinner, the hostess should be dressed and ready to receive her guests, although they are not expected to arrive much before the dinner-hour. Her place should be near enough the door to permit her to welcome each one who enters. To the ladies she says a pleasant word, and establishes them comfortably, chatting with them between the arrivals; to every gentleman she at once indicates the lady whom he is to take in to dinner, introducing him if the parties are strangers. At large and formal dinners, each gentleman, as he passes from the entrance-hall to the drawing-room, receives from an attendant a small envelope, presented upon a <implement>salver,</implement> containing a 
 
<pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=169"/>

card bearing the name of the lady he is expected to escort, and usually a small <emph rend="italic">boutonni&#232;re</emph>: if he does not know the lady, he must at once inform the hostess so that the necessary introduction can take place. The short interval between the arrival of the guests and the service of the dinner may be spent in greeting acquaintances and in pleasant chat about passing events or subjects of general interest: all dinner-talk should be light and amusing, but even common-place is more acceptable than silence. The wise ones avail themselves of this opportunity to approach those to whom they wish to speak, because they know that during dinner conversation is possible only between neighbors, and after it is over all are likely to be engrossed in following up dinner-table topics, or the departure of guests may render intercourse impossible.</p>
<p>When all the guests have arrived, a servant opens the dining-room door when it adjoins the drawing-room; or otherwise he approaches the hostess, and says, "Dinner is served," or "Madame is served." The host then leads the way to the dining-room, with the oldest or most distinguished lady present upon his arm. No delay is made for guests, unless they are of much importance: it is the imperative duty of a guest to be punctual; far better to exceed in earliness than to be one moment late. In the dining-room, the servant draws out the chair of the guest of honor, or that of the lady whom the host escorts: if there are attendants enough, the chairs of all the guests may be drawn out, and replaced by the attendants as the guests are seated. All seat themselves as they enter the room, each gentleman assisting the lady he escorts when there are not enough servants to place the chairs. As the guests arrange themselves comfortably at the table, they may unfold their napkins, and begin to eat the shellfish, without waiting until all are placed when the number is at all large. Usually there is no formal beginning, 
 
<pb n="140" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=170"/>

except at private dinners when some ceremonial of grace preludes the repast: taste and custom regulate these matters. In entering the dining-room after the host, there is no special order of precedence in America, unless the chief magistrate or some locally honored personage is present: ordinarily the gentleman who is the guest of honor goes into the dining-room last, with the hostess, and is seated at her right. If the table is small, the host indicates the places the guests are to occupy as they enter the room; if the party is large, a little <emph rend="italic">menu</emph>-card is placed at each cover, bearing the name of the guest for whom it is designed. After the shellfish is eaten, the lady who is escorted by the host, and who sits at his right hand, is served first, then the other ladies, and after them the gentlemen: each guest may begin to eat as soon as served. The routine of the dinner has been given elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the close of the dinner, the hostess bows to the lady at the right of the host, who rises and opens the door for her, and she leads the way out of the dining-room, the other ladies following her, and the hostess going last: this, of course, is at large formal dinners, otherwise there is no special form imperative. It is a graceful courtesy for the gentlemen to rise as the ladies leave the table, and assist them with their chairs. Sometimes they prefer to accompany them to the drawing-room; but if any remain at the table, the host must stay with them, and see that they are served with <ingredient>wine</ingredient> or cordials, and <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> and cigars. It is of course understood, in polite society, that no excess is tolerated; and any young man showing any inclination to pass the limits of moderation very soon finds himself tabooed. The use of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> at ordinary dinners is a matter of solely personal preference, but at state dinners its absence would be an affront to the guests.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room, the hostess should always chat a 
 
<pb n="141" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=171"/>

little with all her guests, even if the number is large; but she should pay special attention to strangers. If there is any lady present accomplished in any way, the hostess may request her to assist in entertaining the others; and compliance on the part of the guest should be immediate and cheerful, unless there is some grave reason for declining. The hostess may omit such requests for assistance, without implying any offence. In the case of guests who are professionally distinguished, this question of entertainment should always be previously understood, because sometimes there are objections to their contributing to the evening's amusement. After the gentlemen enter the drawing-room, <ingredient>tea</ingredient> should be served, and then the guests are at liberty to depart; but where strict social propriety is preserved, no one should leave until after the guest of honor has gone. As each guest takes leave of the hostess, a few words should be said in acknowledgment of the enjoyment of a pleasant evening, without any reference to the dinner itself. The call after the dinner should be made in due time, as also should the reciprocating hospitality.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">THE ETIQUETTE OF VARIOUS ENTERTAIN-<lb/>MENTS.</hd>
<formula class="etiquette">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">LARGE BREAKFASTS.</purpose>

AS breakfasts are far less expensive than dinner-parties and as the time chosen, between nine and twelve o'clock, is generally less full than the evening hours, these entertainments are greatly favored by people of leisure. In common with luncheons, they afford a pleasant and available form of hospitality which gentlemen without establishments can offer to their lady friends. The etiquette is very simple: an informal written invitation, sent either by hand or post, to which there is an immediate corresponding response, and a return entertainment during the season, when the breakfast is given by a lady, fulfil all requirements. The toilet for guests is a walking costume, and for the host a quiet morning toilet. The place of the entertainment may be in one's own house, or at any well-known restaurant.</p>
<p>The table should be laid in a sunny, cheerful room, with spotless linen and china, and polished glass and silver. The table arrangement for an elaborate breakfast is the same as for dinner, except that no soup is served, and the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> and <ingredient>tea</ingredient> equipages are placed upon the table. <ingredient>Bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> relishes, condiments, <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and flowers, are upon the table; the hot dishes are upon the <implement>sideboard</implement> in <implement>chafing-dishes,</implement> or are served hot from the kitchen in courses, according to the preference of the host. Hot breads come to the table with 
 
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=173"/>

a napkin thrown over them, as also do baked <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>, fritters, fried cakes, <ingredient>scallops,</ingredient> <emph rend="italic">gratins,</emph> breaded chops, <emph rend="italic">croquettes,</emph> and all dishes which would be impaired by having moisture fall upon them as it condenses on china or silver covers. Dry <ingredient>toast</ingredient> should be served in a rack, or the slices set on edge on a hot plate, and only a small quantity made and served at once; it should be delicately brown and crisp; <ingredient>buttered toast</ingredient> should be set in the oven for a moment after it is made, and then served covered with a hot napkin; <ingredient>milk-toast</ingredient> should be served in a covered dish, from which the cover should be lifted quickly and reversed at once to prevent the condensed steam falling back upon the <ingredient>toast.</ingredient> <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> should be cut in small squares, or moulded, and kept in <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> or upon a cake of ice until it is served. Boiled <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> should be served very hot the moment they are done, and eaten from the shell with a spoon: in America the custom prevails of breaking the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> into a glass or cup before eating them. The shells of <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> should be washed in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> before they are boiled. <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> is placed upon the table and eaten as the guests desire. The whole <ingredient>fruits,</ingredient> such as <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> <ingredient>oranges,</ingredient> <ingredient>bananas,</ingredient> <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> and <ingredient>melons,</ingredient> are usually eaten at the beginning of the repast; and those which require <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> such as <ingredient>berries,</ingredient> <ingredient>pine-apples,</ingredient> and <ingredient>peaches,</ingredient> are taken towards its close. The cereals, such as <ingredient>oatmeal,</ingredient> <ingredient>hominy,</ingredient> and cracked <ingredient>wheat,</ingredient> are eaten after the whole <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> with sirup, <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> or <ingredient>preserves.</ingredient> The <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> <ingredient>cocoa,</ingredient> and <ingredient>tea</ingredient> are taken at the guests' pleasure. After the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and cereals come the small <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and garnished side-dishes of <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>game,</ingredient> and poultry. The breakfast closes with the fried cakes, and cut <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> with <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>berries,</ingredient> according to the season.</p>
<p>When wines are used at breakfast, they should be Sauternes, <ingredient>white</ingredient> Burgundy, hock, or claret.</p>
<p>A good breakfast, of medium extent, would be as follows:--</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">THE FAMILY BREAKFAST.</purpose>

This meal is second only in importance to the dinner, especially when any extreme mental labor is demanded of the members of the family. The importance of early and substantial breakfasts is emphasized in the writings of the author upon sanitary matters, and consequently such repetition here is unnecessary; but of the fact that the housekeeper should personally superintend and be present at this meal, there can be no question. If the breakfast is unsatisfactory, a man half hungry or exhausted will generally have recourse to some tonic stimulant to carry him through his morning work; and a second thought is not needed to realize the consequence of such a custom. Our national habits demand that the breakfast shall be hot and abundant, and that there shall be such successive variety that the appetite shall always be stimulated. Fresh <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> in season, or that preserved with little or no <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>radishes,</ingredient> <ingredient>cucumbers,</ingredient> <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> watercress, or <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> should make a part of every breakfast if obtainable. <ingredient>Oatmeal,</ingredient> cracked <ingredient>wheat,</ingredient> or some form of <ingredient>hominy</ingredient> or <ingredient>corn-meal,</ingredient> with <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> or sirup, is indispensable when the family includes children. <ingredient>Coffee,</ingredient> <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> and <ingredient>cocoa</ingredient> are suitable breakfast beverages, but <ingredient>tea</ingredient> is undesirable. <ingredient>Meat,</ingredient> <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> or <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> in some 
 
<pb n="145" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=175"/>

hot form, should always be served, and <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> or variety in breads are desirable. Nearly all American breakfasts include some form of hot fried cakes with sirup or <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient></p>
<p>The family breakfast-table is laid with the coffee-service at the head of the table; the largest hot dish at the other end; a knife, fork, spoon, glass, napkin, small <ingredient>bread</ingredient>-and-<implement>butter plate,</implement> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> at each cover; and the side-dish, breads, and <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> at convenient places upon the table. When <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is served first, as a separate course, it may be placed before the other dishes are brought in, with a special plate, <ingredient>fruit</ingredient>-knife, and napkin, and a <implement>finger-bowl</implement> for each cover, which are to be removed before the breakfast is served.</p>
<p>When there are not many servants, the care of the breakfast-table falls upon the ladies of the family; and there should be preparations made for clearing away the table, and washing all but the greasy dishes in the breakfast-room. A side-table is necessary for this, or a large butler's tray, upon which the dishes can be gathered in regular piles or groups after they are freed from the remains of the breakfast. Any dishes removed from the table in the course of the meal can be placed there, being protected from flies if they contain food which can be used again; the plates and saucers in little piles, the cups and glasses in groups, and the spoons, knives, and forks in a tray.</p>
<p>To wash the dishes, a small wooden tub or a tin pan, with a little mop or a clean dishcloth, <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> and plenty of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> for washing and rinsing, are required. The glasses are to be washed first, rinsed in <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> and dried at once on clean towels; then the cups and saucers and the <ingredient>sauce</ingredient>-dishes; next the silver; and finally the dishes and empty platters, all scraps of food having first been removed from them. The washing-water should be changed frequently, and a little borax or washing-soda dissolved in it to facilitate the removal of the <ingredient>grease.</ingredient> When a butler's pantry adjoins

the breakfast-room, the dishes are always washed there; the same care being exercised in keeping the sink clean as in the kitchen. Dishes removed to the kitchen to be washed should be just as neatly and carefully treated as in the pantry or breakfast-room: after the dishcloths and towels are used, they should be thoroughly washed in hot soapy <ingredient>water,</ingredient> rinsed in hot <ingredient>clean water,</ingredient> and dried in the sun or at least in the open air.</p>

The range for family luncheon is as elastic as that for more formal occasions. In the country, and also in town where there are children in the family, it often takes on the form of a simple dinner; in that case, the service is as for dinner, the dessert-service and <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> being upon the <implement>side-board.</implement> If the luncheon is plain, the service is the same as for breakfast. The suitable dishes are small hot <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>game</ingredient>-birds, poultry, dressed salads, all forms of <ingredient>potatoes and eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> and <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> vegetables, <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> and sweets. A servant may attend, or any one may rise from the table to fetch what is required.</p>
<p>In the country, or where the luncheon is practically the children's dinner, the service should include soup or <emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> if possible; the latter is served in shallow bowl-shaped cups, the former in small <implement>soup-plates.</implement> A hot joint, with one <ingredient>cold meat</ingredient> if desired in addition, <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> boiled or baked, and one or more hot vegetables, together with a simple dessert, gives a good luncheon variety.

Among intimate friends an invitation to luncheon may be general, or it is quite proper for them to claim hospitality without it.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">LUNCHEON PARTIES.</purpose>

Luncheons are essentially ladies' parties, usually given by ladies in their own homes; sometimes an informal lunch is given at some restaurant celebrated for some special dish, but the preference is for the home entertainment. The invitations are the same as for breakfasts. The table is laid as for dinner, save that the linen may be embroidered or colored; and any dinner form of service may be followed, save that some of the courses are omitted. At an informal luncheon, all the dishes may be placed upon the table at once, after the shellfish and <emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> are eaten; and then the attendants may be sent from the room if the guests wish to be alone with the hostess. Fruit, flowers, and relishes may be used in decorating the table, together with any sweets not iced: these are to be served at the moment of eating. <emph rend="italic">Bon bons,</emph> <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> and confectionery are in place on the lunch-table. The bill of fare may range from <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> and <ingredient>ale,</ingredient> to a <emph rend="italic">menu</emph> elaborate enough for a little dinner. The formal luncheon begins with <emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> or <ingredient>broth</ingredient> served in china bowl-shaped cups standing in saucers, or with a dinner-soup served in a <implement>soup-plate;</implement> next come the hot <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> combination salads, <ingredient>terrapin;</ingredient> and then Roman punch, and the <ingredient>broiled game</ingredient> with green salad; and last the sweets and <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> <ingredient>Chocolate</ingredient> is an appropriate luncheon beverage, as also are malt liquors for plain lunches. The luncheon wines are Sauterne, <ingredient>sherry,</ingredient> and <ingredient>Champagne;</ingredient> or the different summer beverages, such as claret-cup and its kindred, may be used; or <ingredient>wine</ingredient> may be omitted altogether, at choice. The formal luncheon is served like the dinner <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> the attendant beginning the service with the lady at the right hand of the hostess. The guest's preference is asked in the matter of <ingredient>wine;</ingredient> the plates are changed as at dinner, cold ones being used for salad and dessert; <implement>finger-bowls</implement> are placed with the

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS.</purpose>

The double motive of securing the visits of pleasant friends, and of massing together such tedious ones as might be unwelcome, leads many ladies to choose a day for the reception of visitors. The time is specified upon the visiting-cards which are used with those to whom one desires to be "at home." The form may be "<emph rend="italic">At home Wednesdays,</emph>" "<emph rend="italic">Wednesdays, 4 to 6,</emph>" or, when it is desirable to limit the time, "<emph rend="italic">Wednesdays in December;</emph>" the day, hour, or month being chosen with reference to other social duties or occupations. Very often married ladies invite some young friend to receive with them, and in that case the young lady's name appears upon the card of the hostess:--</p>
<p align="center" rend="italic">Mrs. Charles Adams,<lb/>Miss Brewster,<lb/>At Home<lb/>Wednesday, December Second, from 4 to 6.<lb/>29 West 41st Street.</p>
<ednote>The text above appears inside a box, in the form of an invitation.</ednote>
<p>The receipt of a card bearing a <ingredient>date</ingredient> like this is an invitation to the recipient; if the hour named is in daylight, the costume called for is a quietly elegant carriage-toilet or walking-dress, with an appropriate bonnet and wrap. Cards are not left by the callers unless there is a card reciever in the entrance-hall; in that case the card is left there when the guest departs. As the servant opens the door, the visitors pass at once into the drawing-room, where the hostess receives: her dress should be a fresh but not too elaborate home toilette. Callers are not necessarily introduced, but 
 
<pb n="150" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=180"/>

they are at liberty to chat with each other, because discrimination in the distribution of cards is taken for granted; and the hostess must manage to entertain all with equal attention; in order to assist the hostess in this rather difficult position, the call should be short. If it is impossible to call upon set days, the visitor should be content to leave her card, as only decided intimacy warrants the request to see a lady except upon her "days." When refreshments are served at these afternoon receptions, they should be quite simple; a few fancy <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic">petit-fours,</emph> with <ingredient>wine</ingredient> or <ingredient>cordial,</ingredient> may be upon a side-table where one of the ladies of the family presides, or they may be passed upon a small <implement>salver</implement> by a maid-servant. Cake and lemonade, or very dainty sandwiches and <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> may be used at discretion; in any case the refreshment must be light, otherwise the reception takes on the appearance of a kettle-drum.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">AFTERNOON TEAS.</purpose>

The pleasantest of all informal social gatherings are those known as <ingredient>teas,</ingredient> high <ingredient>teas,</ingredient> and kettle-drums; sometimes they take their name from some special characteristic, such as the color of the <ingredient>tea</ingredient>-equipage or of the napery or the flowers, lovely effects being possible. The hostess invites a few friends, either verbally or by an informal note; or, when these entertainments are to be frequent, she may save herself trouble by having a card engraved in script, with blanks for dates:--</p>
<p align="center" rend="italic">Mr. George Morris,<lb/>Wednesday,.............<lb/>No. 5 West 23 St.&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;<ingredient>Tea</ingredient> at Five o'clock.</p>

<p>When young ladies receive, their names appear on their mother's card; if the mother is dead, upon the father's card, and the card of the chaperone who is to assist them is sent at the same time. The invitations are given about three days in advance, and should receive the courtesy of a written answer; after the <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> a card should be left within two or three days by those invited as well as by the guests, unless the latter are intimate, when the call may be omitted, but the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> must be returned in due season. The hostess usually invites friends, or those whom she knows wish to become acquainted. The proper toilet is the same as for afternoon-receptions. If the <ingredient>tea</ingredient>-table is large, it may be laid with an embroidered cloth with napkins to match; ornamented china and flowers may be used. Where the large table is used, and there are several ladies to assist in entertaining the guests, they may be seated at it; but when the hostess presides alone, it is more convenient and pleasant to have the <ingredient>tea</ingredient> served from a side-table by the servants, to little tables placed near groups of guests in different parts of the room. Some of these little tables are provided with an under-shelf which is available for an extra plate or cup. The ornamentation of the small tables is often beautiful in the extreme, as they are a favorite medium for displaying the skill of the hostess in embroidery, or her taste in the choice of harmonious surroundings.</p>
<p>Some <ingredient>teas</ingredient> take their title from a specialty of ornamentation: for instance, at a pink <ingredient>tea</ingredient> the prevailing color in table-linen, china, and flowers, would be pink; at a rose <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> rose-color would exceed, and the flowers would be roses, including a corsage bouquet for each guest, or a choice flower in the winter season. The <ingredient>tea</ingredient> should consist of thin <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> delicate sandwiches and relishes, and some very good <ingredient>tea.</ingredient> The finer brands of Chinese and Russian <ingredient>tea</ingredient> can now sometimes be obtained in this country. A favorite

English mixture is one pound of Congo to a quarter of a pound each of Assam and <ingredient>Orange</ingredient> Pekoe; another delicious <ingredient>tea</ingredient> mixture which is sent to Eastern friends from ladies in San Francisco is the Chinese Kettle-drum brand. Cake, <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> or dressed salads may be served if desired; but the table should never be overloaded, or exhibit an ostentatious display.</p>

As ladies entertain their intimates at luncheons, so gentlemen delight in special suppers,--fish-suppers, game-suppers, oyster-suppers, or general entertainments where the <emph rend="italic">menu</emph> embraces all the delicacies of the season. As the hostess never appears at these suppers, they can be made absolutely perfect if she is a good housewife. They may either be parties of invitation, the guests being notified three or four days in advance, or <emph rend="italic">impromptu</emph> when the scope of one's establishment permits a sudden accession in numbers. The hour chosen is generally late, after a card-party or a visit to some place of amusement. The table appointments may be the same as for breakfasts or luncheons, according to the service of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> or <ingredient>wine.</ingredient> There should always be black <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> served from the side-table, some flowers and <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> plenty of light, and <ingredient>wine</ingredient> at discretion or claret- or

At the set supper, whether it follows an evening at the theatre or an entertainment at home, or whether it is made the subject of special invitation, the service is either that of the luncheon for informal affairs, or that of the dinner <emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> in courses with appropriate wines, except that no soup is used, either <emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> or stewed <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> replacing it. <ingredient>Oysters</ingredient> in any form and in variety are appropriate at all suppers, except that raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are not usually served at ball-suppers. A plain supper may consist of a dish of <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> a cold <ingredient>roast chicken,</ingredient> and a salad; one <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> or punch, or <ingredient>tea</ingredient> or <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> at pleasure.

These parties are good amusements for evenings in autumn and winter. They are usually composed of intimates: the entire service is informal, and very little of the burden of entertainment falls upon the hosts. And only the lightest of refreshments are necessary: they should be of such nature as to permit partaking of them without interfering with the games; either <ingredient>sherry</ingredient> and <ingredient>biscuit,</ingredient> claret-cup, or <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> with little cakes, or <ingredient>ale,</ingredient> <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> are suitable and sufficient; they may be served from a side-table, or placed upon little tables near the guests as at afternoon <ingredient>teas.</ingredient> Claret-cup is made either in a fancy flagon or pitcher of glass, or in a large silver "loving-cup" holding over a quart, made in the form of a high vase, richly engraved and decorated; when the beverage is drank as a "loving-cup," a large, fine white napkin is placed in one of the handles, for the purpose of wiping the edge of the cup after each guest drinks from it.

When a chance caller arrives at a house while any entertainment is going on, to which guests have been invited, it is perfectly permissible for the hostess to be "not at home;" this excuse, given by the servant at the door, should never be made a subject of social comment or offence, because the hostess has a right to decide what friends she shall select to partake of any form of pleasure, or for the discharge of her social obligations.</p>

<pb n="157" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=187"/>

in the same envelope. The invitations to wedding-breakfasts are sent out two weeks in advance, and the reply must be as immediate and formal as for a dinner. At wedding-receptions, a servant should be at the door of the drawing-room to announce the names of callers, whose cards, bearing an address, must be left in the hall; gentlemen leave their hats in the hall when there is a breakfast. Invited guests must either attend the reception, or send cards within ten days, call personally within the season or the year, and if possible entertain the newly wedded pair within three months. At a reception, the refreshments may be a cake and one <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> but no <ingredient>tea</ingredient> or <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is served even at a full breakfast. The wedding-breakfast may consist of <emph rend="italic">bouillon,</emph> <ingredient>wine</ingredient> at choice, salads, small <ingredient>game,</ingredient> shellfish, ices, creams, and <ingredient>jellies;</ingredient> the wedding-cake is set before the bride, who cuts the first slice; boxes of the same kind of cake are upon the table for the guests to take, but they are no longer sent out.

<p>After the return from the wedding-tour, the bride and groom are given dinners at the houses of both their families and of the bridesmaids.

least distinguished person to the celebrity, first being sure that the introduction is desired by both parties. At large <ingredient>teas,</ingredient> receptions, and garden-parties, general introductions are out of the question: but the guests are at liberty to converse without them; they do not necessarily involve themselves in future intercourse thereby, nor do they by watering-place introductions unless they are desired.</p>

<formula class="etiquette">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">COUNTRY-HOUSE PARTIES.</purpose>

The entertainment of guests at country houses demands much more hospitable feeling and versatility of attainments than the courtesy of city party-giving, which taxes the host for only a few hours. To the pleased guest at a country house, the agreeable visit may easily lengthen into weeks unless a limit has been set in the invitation; but what seems to him an unbroken round of natural pleasures may have severely taxed the hospitable ingenuity of the entertainer, so that a visit should never be extended unless the guest has every assurance that it is desired. All enjoyment under such circumstances depends upon the prevalence of harmony of tastes and feeling among the guests; for, despite the fact that many out-door amusements and occupations engross them during the day, every evening re-unites them. If their selection for a three-hour dinner requires tact and thought, how much more is demanded when the arrangement is for the long and informal association which country life implies!</p>
<p>In inviting guests to a country house, the date and duration of the visit should be defined; and, when the invitation is accepted, the hostess should at once advise the guest of the most convenient way of reaching her house, giving the hours for trains if the expected arrival is to be by rail, and having a carriage at the depot upon the arrival of the train, unless the party of guests coming at once is very large; in that case, etiquette does not require the hostess to send carriage 
 
<pb n="159" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=189"/>

if there are any public conveyances, although it is a graceful courtesy to do so. It is not imperative to welcome the guests at the station, but the hostess should, if possible, be at home when they reach the house: if they come in turn, after the departure of others, and if she is absent from the house pending the entertainment of resident guests, she should see that all preparations are made for the comfort of the latest comers, and should order <ingredient>tea</ingredient> to be served in their rooms at once. It is allowable for guests to refresh themselves and rest before joining the company below stairs, but only illness is a plea for the absence of either guests or hostess from the dinner-table. Before the dinner-hour the hostess should be in the parlors to receive the guests, and introduce them to each other; and she should designate companions in specifying the order of entering the dining-room, unless the party is a family one, when all formality may be dispensed with. After dinner, the evening's amusement should be so planned by her as to throw congenial people together, and to allot to each one that share of the general entertainment best suited to his or her capacity or accomplishments; for in such assemblies the pleasure of all often depends upon the talents of individuals. Books, musical instruments, games, and various devices for social amusement are plentiful and varied, so that no hostess need be at a loss for aids to her hospitality. When bedtime arrives, the hostess should give the signal for retiring. In the morning she should preside at the breakfast-table for about an hour, after which she may leave the late-comers to the care of the servants, and devote herself to the pleasure of the guests who first join her, until personal or household matters demand her attention. Unless the house-party is large, all the guests should endeavor to be at the breakfast-table with some degree of punctuality; but the breakfast should begin at its stated hour. Letters and papers may be 
 
<pb n="160" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=190"/>

glanced at during the meal if the party is large enough to be redeemed from stupidity by such proceeding, but it shows a lack of courtesy to centre one's entire attention upon a book during any repast when others are present at the table.</p>
<p>After luncheon the hostess must devote herself to her guests until it is time to dress for dinner; that is, she must devise some scheme of pleasure in which all can join, or see that individuals have some pleasant occupation offered. But in no case need she burden herself with undue care; after once having made sure that she has placed enjoyment within the reach of her guests, she may leave them to avail themselves of it, or to rest, as best contents them. On Sunday the hostess should accompany guests to church, when they desire to attend divine service, preceding them up the aisle, and standing by the pew-door until they are seated. When the guests are ready to terminate their visit, the hostess should be in the parlor in ample time for them to make their farewell and reach their train without haste.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">GARDEN AND LAWN PARTIES.</purpose>

All brief country entertainments, such as summer garden and lawn parties, tennis, archery and croquet tournaments, and picnics and drives, are arranged with reference to the weather: the invitations take on the form of an informal note, and usually bear the proviso "weather permitting," although guests are never expected on wet days. The invitations are issued in the name of the hostess, and are not engraved unless the affair is one of magnitude: when carriages are to meet any special train bringing guests from the city, the invitation should indicate that fact, and a time-table should be enclosed with the invitation. The hostess should receive her guests in a handsome garden-dress with a bonnet: the guests should wear tennis, archery, or other special dress, when the party assumes any definite character; otherwise a <pb n="161" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=191"/>

pretty summer dress is suitable for the ladies, and any well-made flannel or woollen suit for the gentlemen.</p>
<p>When the entertainment involves special exercise, as when tennis is played, there should be pleasant seats provided out of doors; and if there is not plenty of shade, one or more tents should be erected; and rugs should be laid if the ground is at all damp. When games are to be played, the best possible outfit should be provided, suited in abundance and variety to the number of guests; and such games should be chosen as afford amusement to both ladies and gentlemen. When the games are exhausting, there should be a special tent devoted to the comfort of the players, and provided with such forms of light refreshments and restoratives as are most quickly conducive to comfort,--cordials, hot <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> cigars, and the cooling "cups" especially; and there should be an attendant constantly in service there, besides some one to come and go between the house and the tent.</p>
<p>The form of refreshment for all the lawn-parties is about the same. Either a room opening upon the lawn, or a tent, is set apart for the repast, and servants attend to it all the time while the guests are upon the grounds. The dishes are generally small cold <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> sandwiches, relishes, salads, and a few small sweets; ices, <emph rend="italic">sorbets,</emph> and ice-creams are acceptable, together with the small <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> in season; <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> claret and <ingredient>champagne</ingredient> cups, lemonade, and the various temperance beverages, are supplied plentifully, contained in glass pitchers, and poured into tumblers. The picnic refreshments should be chiefly cold luncheon dishes, which can be transported easily and neatly, with very few sweets; <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> and lemonade are generally made upon the picnic ground, and if any wines are used they should be warming; <ingredient>cordial</ingredient> of some kind, or <ingredient>spirits,</ingredient> should be carried in case of sudden illness.</p>
<p>The spot chosen for picnics should be remote enough

to be secure from intrusion, but near some shelter, because summer storms so often come up without any previous indication: there should be no glare of sun or <ingredient>water</ingredient> without the possible relief of a grove or a tent, because that alone often causes serious discomfort and even sickness. The dress should be a stout walking-costume of woollen material, with a hat large enough to shelter the eyes, and a cane or staff if there is any rough climbing. In arranging a picnic party, if gentlemen are available they should equal the ladies in number; and unless the picnic is an invitation affair, each party should understand what part of the luncheon they are expected to contribute. When invitations are issued, they should go out about a week in advance of the date fixed upon, and should include the house-party of the person to whom they are sent unless some young lady is invited to complete a desired number; then the invitation should include her chaperone. Invitations should be answered at once definitely. When the party arrives at the picnic ground, the hours for luncheon and departure should be fixed upon, and then the pursuits of the day may be followed according to individual inclination; but unless there are plenty of attendants, the labor of preparing and removing the luncheon should not be allowed to fall upon a few persons unless they desire it to be so. The day's enjoyment should not be marred by too late a stay or too lingering a return, and stragglers by inclination should remember that their delay may mar the pleasure of others. When the picnic is not one of invitation, but the meeting of friends commonly bent on enjoyment, each guest may defray a share of the general expense.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">SHELL-FISH ON THE HALF-SHELL (HU&#238;TRES).</purpose>

THE custom generally prevails in this country, of beginning every dinner, where there is any attempt at formality, with small shell-fish served on the half-shell. Even in the inland towns, <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and <ingredient>hard clams</ingredient> can usually be procured, for they are now shipped in barrels from the eastern seaboard to all parts of the country accessible by rail. Sometimes a fine grade of canned <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> is served on plates painted to imitate five or six half <ingredient>oyster-shells;</ingredient> but great care should be exercised, if this is done, to have the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> used directly the can is opened; if there is the slightest taint, or deterioration from exposure to the air, the success of the dinner will be marred. Indeed, it is best to omit this first service of <ingredient>shell-fish,</ingredient> unless they can be freshly taken from the shells. The proper accompaniments for raw shell-fish are <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> and <ingredient>brown bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> both of which are placed upon the table when it is laid.</p>

Choose the smallest plump <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> which can be obtained. In the New-York markets, all very small <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in good condition for serving on the half-shell are called Blue-Points.

The small native <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> of California are excellent, having the coppery taste so much esteemed by European epicures. The small <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> of the southern Atlantic seaboard are delicious. Have the shells of the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> liberally dashed with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to free them from mud, and then open them, loosening the <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> from both sides of the shell by dividing the muscle variously called the "eye" and the "heart" (both terms are erroneous); take off the shallow half of the shell, leaving the <ingredient>oyster</ingredient> lying loose in the deep part, carefully removing all bits of shell which may be broken in opening the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient>: if the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are carefully opened, very little of the shell will be broken. Arrange the deep half-shells containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> upon plates, five or six on each plate, with the smallest part of the shell towards the centre of the plate; put a quarter of a <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> in the midst of the <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and have more <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> upon the table, together with several plates of <ingredient>brown bread,</ingredient> cut very thin and buttered and then folded to enclose the <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Do not dish the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> until just as they are wanted for the table: they may be opened, arranged in the deep shells on a large pan or tray, and kept in the <implement>ice-box</implement> until just before serving them. The plates containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are placed upon the tables just before the guests enter the dining-room.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">OYSTERS IN A BLOCK OF ICE.</purpose>

This method of icing <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> is more suitable for luncheon, or for a gentlemen's supper, than for a dinner-service. A block of clear ice is best: snow-ice, or that which is opaque and full of air-holes, melts more quickly than clear ice. Make a slight hollow in the upper surface of the ice, and lay the deep half-shells containing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in this cavity; place the block of ice on a dish large enough to contain all the <ingredient>water</ingredient> from the melting ice, and then at once serve the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> on the block of ice. When there are many 
 
<pb n="165" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=195"/>

guests, a block of ice may be surrounded by unopened <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and several layers of the <ingredient>shell-fish</ingredient> placed upon the top: this necessitates the opening of the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> at the table, an operation difficult to accomplish unless one is an expert at "stabbing" the <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> or prying open the shells, without pounding off the edges. The <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> might be partly opened, care being taken not to lose their liquor, and then packed around and upon the block of ice, with their deep shells undermost: the opening would then be a comparatively simple matter. Of course, this service of <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> necessitates an ample supply of napery, and sometimes an entire change of the table-linen.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">OYSTERS IN ICE.</purpose>

A caterer's device for serving raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> at a dinner of sixteen persons may be noted. Hollow shapes had been frozen to represent <ingredient>apples</ingredient> made of ice, the upper half movable and lifted by a stem; the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> were placed in the lower section of the <ingredient>apple,</ingredient> which was set on a small <implement>doily</implement> laid on a plate: a few bits of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> made a pretty garnish. The objection to this method of icing the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> was, that the melting of the ice-<ingredient>apple</ingredient> plunged them in a bath of <ingredient>ice-water;</ingredient> while the hollow at the bottom of the interior of the <ingredient>apple</ingredient> collected the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> in a wet mass. They lost not only their natural flavor, but also their individuality: one of the excellences of the service on the half-shell is that each bivalve reaches the consumer in its legitimate habitat, and surrounded by its own distinctive liquor.</p>
<p>When half-shells are not obtainable, the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates might be iced by being left for an hour or longer in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> so that they would speedily cool the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> placed upon them; or a thin film of ice might be frozen over them, by exposing them to a freezing temperature with a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> in each one: this, however, would make the 
 
<pb n="166" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=196"/>

<ingredient>oysters</ingredient> watery as the ice melted. A third method of icing <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> is given in the next recipe.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">COLD CANNED OYSTERS.</purpose>

When it is impossible to obtain fresh <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> for the half-shell service before dinner, a partial substitute may be made from canned <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> by carefully following the details of this recipe. The <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> will be most presentable if served on the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates which imitate the shells; and they must be absolutely cold.</p>
<p>From a can of fine <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> select the largest and fattest; see that no bits of shell adhere to them, and drain them on a sieve; put their liquor over the fire with an equal quantity of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and enough <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to cover the <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> and let the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> thus made boil, removing all scum as it rises. When the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> is quite free from scum, throw the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> into it, and watch them closely; the instant they become full and plump, skim them out of the <ingredient>broth,</ingredient> and again lay them on the sieve to drain. A very little time will suffice to make the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> plump: if they are allowed to cook until they shrivel, they will be spoiled for this dish. As soon as the <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are placed on the sieve, cover them with a cloth wet in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and let them cool; when they are entirely cold, arrange them on the fancy <ingredient>oyster</ingredient>-plates, and serve them cold, with <ingredient>lemon and brown bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">LITTLE-NECK CLAMS ON THE HALF-SHELL.</purpose>

Choose fresh small <ingredient>Little-Neck clams,</ingredient> of even size; wash the shells with plenty of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> and, just before serving them, open the <ingredient>clams</ingredient> like raw <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> leaving each <ingredient>clam</ingredient> in one of the shells with its liquor, after entirely loosening it from the shell. Arrange half a dozen <ingredient>clams</ingredient> on a plate, as half-shell raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> are arranged; put a piece of <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> on each plate, and serve the <ingredient>clams</ingredient> at the beginning of dinner,

<p>The fresh raw <ingredient>clams</ingredient> are an excellent tonic and appetizer; and their fresh liquor is a more valuable stimulant for invalids than <ingredient>beef-tea,</ingredient> as made according to usual methods or from <ingredient>meat</ingredient> extracts.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold">SOUPS <emph rend="italic">(Potage).</emph></hd>
<recipe class1="soups">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">SOUP STOCK.</purpose>

THE same general directions in regard to boiling, clarifying, and coloring <ingredient>soup-stock,</ingredient> will apply to the making of any clear soup or <emph rend="italic">bouillon:</emph> the difference is in the ingredients used, and the flavor which results. Ordinary <ingredient>stock</ingredient> may be prepared in about three hours; but when a gelatinous <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is desired, the boiling must be continued for five or six hours in order to extract the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> from the bones. While the <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> thickens soup, it does not add to its nutriment; and unless the <implement>soup-kettle</implement> is kept very closely covered while the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is boiling, much of its flavor and some of its substance will escape with the steam during long-continued boiling.</p>
<p>To make <ingredient>stock</ingredient> for an ordinary clear soup, use <ingredient>beef</ingredient> cut from the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> or <ingredient>leg,</ingredient> including a <ingredient>marrow-bone;</ingredient> allow a pound of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone</ingredient> for each quart of <ingredient>stock.</ingredient> Trim off any defective parts, and wipe the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> with a wet towel; cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> in rather large pieces, so that it may be used for hashes or potted <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> there is still some nourishment remaining in it after the soup is made, and it retains a pleasant flavor from the vegetables and <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> used in the soup; it is only the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> remaining from <ingredient>beef-tea</ingredient> which has little food value or flavor. After the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is cut from the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> have the <ingredient>bones</ingredient> broken in rather small pieces, and lay them in the bottom of the <implement>soup-kettle;</implement> put the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> on the <ingredient>bones,</ingredient> and add <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in the proportion of one quart of 
 
<pb n="169" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=199"/>

<ingredient>water</ingredient> to one pound of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bone;</ingredient> set the kettle over the fire, cover it, and heat its contents until they boil, removing all scum as it rises; the scum is composed of blood and albumen, and is to be saved to add to any thick brown soup or <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> because it is nutritious; the object of removing it in making <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is to leave the <ingredient>broth</ingredient> clear; a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> added while the scum is rising will hasten the operation.</p>
<p>While the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is being thus freed from scum, prepare the vegetables as follows: To four quarts of <ingredient>stock</ingredient> allow one medium-size <ingredient>carrot</ingredient> scraped, one medium-size <ingredient>turnip</ingredient> peeled, one medium-size <ingredient>onion</ingredient> peeled, without cutting the top or root close, or breaking the layers apart; stick into the <ingredient>onion</ingredient> a dozen whole <ingredient>cloves;</ingredient> wash one medium-size root of <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> with the stalks and leaves attached, lay the leafy part in the palm of the left hand, in the midst of the leaves place a dozen whole <ingredient>peppercorns,</ingredient> a small blade of <ingredient>mace,</ingredient> a small bay-leaf, and one sprig of any <ingredient>dried sweet herb</ingredient> except <ingredient>sage;</ingredient> if <ingredient>celery</ingredient> is in season, one of the smaller green stalks or about half a dozen of the green leaves may be added; and then the <ingredient>parsley root</ingredient> and leaves wrapped around the other seasonings, and the little bunch tied compactly with cord. After all the scum has been removed from the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> put in the vegetables, together with two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and replace the cover of the <implement>soup-kettle.</implement> Let the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> boil gently for two hours or longer. If the kettle is placed so that the heat strikes it from one side, causing the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> to boil from one side, the soup will be clearer after it is strained than if the boiling is taking place in all parts of the kettle at once.</p>
<p>When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> has boiled the desired length of time, lay a folded clean towel in a <implement>colander</implement> set over an earthen bowl or jar large enough to hold the <ingredient>stock;</ingredient> take up the <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and set it aside to use in any dish of the nature indicated above; the vegetables may be chopped and combined with some 
 
<pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=200"/>

of the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in the form of a hash, which should be highly seasoned. Pour the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> through the towel, letting it run through without stirring or squeezing it to disturb the little sediment which will remain upon the towel; when all the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> has run through the towel, remove the <implement>colander,</implement> put a sieve or a piece of <implement>cheese-cloth</implement> over the bowl or jar, to protect the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> and let it cool. If a close earthen or metal cover were used, the steam from the hot <ingredient>stock</ingredient> would condense upon its inner surface, and partly sour; falling back into the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> it would deteriorate the whole. When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is entirely cold, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> which forms on the surface in a cake can be removed, and both the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> clarified in accordance with the recipes given below.</p>
</recipe>

<recipe class1="soups">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">CLEAR SOUP OR CONSOMM&#201;.</purpose>

When the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> is quite cold, remove the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> from the surface; for each quart of <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> allow the <ingredient>white</ingredient> and shell of one <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and a tablespoonful of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> put these ingredients into a saucepan, and mix them together, then pour in the <ingredient>stock;</ingredient> set the saucepan over the fire, and heat its contents gradually, stirring occasionally to prevent the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Allow the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> to heat and boil gently; the albumen of the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> will entangle all the cloudy particles floating in the <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> and thus clarify it; let the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> boil until it looks perfectly clear under the <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> that will rise and <ingredient>float</ingredient> upon the surface in the form of a thick white scum, under which the <ingredient>stock</ingredient> will show a clear <ingredient>amber</ingredient> color; when it has boiled long enough to insure this appearance, pour it into a folded towel laid in a <implement>colander</implement> set over an earthen bowl; let the soup run through the towel without moving or squeezing it. The soup will be perfectly clear, and of a delicate <ingredient>amber</ingredient> color, if these directions are carefully followed: it may then be salted to taste, and served. Clear soup should never be dark in color like <emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> or

<ingredient>broth</ingredient>: if too light, a very little <ingredient>caramel</ingredient> may be used to darken it. After the soup is clarified, if there is any <ingredient>fat</ingredient> floating upon the surface, lay one piece of paper after another upon the top, removing each one as it becomes saturated with <ingredient>grease;</ingredient> use any soft absorbent paper, the ordinary white wrapping-paper used for <ingredient>tea</ingredient> being the most serviceable. All thin soups should be entirely free from <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and the paper must be used to remove it: the most careful skimming will not accomplish this result.</p>

<p>THE shellfish suitable for the first dinner service, before the soup, have already been mentioned; the rest which are included in this chapter belong properly among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> together with the fried, broiled, and scalloped fish. Only boiled and baked fish are appropriate for formal English dinners; frequently the small hot dishes of fried and broiled fish are served at little dinners, as well as at breakfasts, luncheons, and suppers. The service of small <implement>fish dishes</implement> is essentially Continental, and is both convenient and economical. Terrapin and green turtle are included in this chapter, although they are distinctive enough to be made a separate course at dinner. Madeira is the proper wine for terrapin, and punch is served with green turtle. The limited space for recipes in this volume does not admit of the possible variety in this chapter, any more than in the others; but here, as elsewhere, a sufficient number are given to indicate the great diversity of treatment which food may receive. The directions given for boning, boiling, frying, broiling, or baking any one kind of fish may be applied to any other which has the same general characteristics of size and texture. The very dry-fleshed fish should be served with a sauce: fish which are either watery or very oily are best when cooked with direct exposure to the fire, as in broiling.

Thoroughly wash the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> lay it on its side on the table, and with a sharp, thin-bladed knife make a straight cut from the middle of the head, down the side, to the middle of the tail, cutting through the flesh down to the <ingredient>bone;</ingredient> then, with the point of the knife, begin to cut the flesh from the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> at the <ingredient>head,</ingredient> lifting it with the left hand as it is cut, so that the edge of the knife may not mangle it, and keeping the knife laid flat and close to the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> until the flesh is cut outward to the fins, and free from the <ingredient>bone</ingredient> from the <ingredient>head</ingredient> to the tail; then cut it off along the line of the fins; this will give one-fourth of the flesh of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in the form of a long, narrow strip; cut off the remaining three-fourths in the same manner, and lay the strips, skin 
 
<pb n="202" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=232"/>

down, upon the table. To remove the skin, hold the tail end of one of the strips firmly with the left hand; take the knife in the right hand, and cut down through the flesh of the strip at the end nearest the left hand, until the skin is reached, but do not cut through the skin. When the edge of the knife reaches the skin, begin slowly to turn the knife with the edge outward until the blade lies flat on the skin and against the table; keep the knife in this position, and cut toward the upper end of the strip, taking care neither to turn the edge of the knife upward, as that would send it into the flesh, nor downward, because that would make it cut through the skin. If these directions are carefully followed, the skin can be removed from the flesh without any waste. After the skin is taken off, cut the strips of <ingredient>fish</ingredient> in pieces of even size, about two inches wide and five inches long.</p>
<p>Roll up as many of these pieces as are desired, making a little compact roll of each one, and place them side by side in an earthen dish which will just contain them; season them highly with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> put a bit of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> about half an inch square on each one, and bake them in a hot oven until the flakes begin to separate; then serve them at once in the dish in which they were baked.

<p>These directions will serve as a guide in boning any kind of fresh <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> which has been frozen cannot be boned easily, because the flakes are apt to break apart upon the least pressure.</p>

<p>To boil <ingredient>mussels,</ingredient> place them in a large kettle, after they are thoroughly washed, with half a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and set them over the fire until the shells open; the liquor which flows from them should be carefully strained, and kept to use with them. After the <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> are boiled, take them from the shells, carefully remove all the fine filaments attached to the "tongue" or "foot" of the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> cut off the tip of the "<ingredient>tongue</ingredient>" and the dark, fringe-like edge, or beard, which surrounds the gills; the thread-like filaments are called the "moss," and this is supposed to be more or less poisonous. The office of the moss, or byssus, is to attach the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> to the rocks or wharves where it is found. It should always be carefully removed before the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> is dressed, after it is boiled. Some cooks always use a silver spoon in preparing <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> for the table, thinking that it will become blackened if they are unfit for food.</p>
<p><ingredient>Mussels</ingredient> are sometimes eaten raw like <ingredient>oysters;</ingredient> but this is not advisable, because some medical authorities assert that the <ingredient>mussel</ingredient> occasionally contains a poisonous substance which is neutralized by cooking, as is the case with some varieties of <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient> Cases of poisoning by <ingredient>mussels</ingredient> yield to intelligent medical treatment.</p>

<p>AMONG the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> are classed not only the smaller meat dishes suitable for this service at dinners where several courses are used, but also many excellent breakfast and luncheon dishes. Often when there are only two or three persons for dinner, who do not care for an elaborate service, some hot meal <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;e,</emph> with one or two vegetables and a simple dessert, makes up the meal. But since health so largely depends upon a variety in food, it is not well to limit the service habitually, although many of the side-dishes are attractive because they can easily be prepared from inexpensive materials. In this connection the fact should be remembered, that many soups and salads are also inexpensive, and they are both unquestionably most wholesome and appetizing.</p>
<p>The side-dishes generally admit of garnishes; and many of them which are fried can be tastefully arranged upon napkins, with lemon and parsley. The imported lace papers replace napkins very prettily in the service of <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> both hot and cold.</p>
<p>Many <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es</emph> are larded with larding pork or bacon. As there are some objections to its use, it may, to a degree, be replaced by strips of tongue boiled tender; or of uncooked beef-fat, if any can be found tough enough to bear the strain of pulling it through the raw meat.</p>

fatty portions of the stomachs of <ingredient>calves</ingredient> and <ingredient>cows,</ingredient> carefully cleansed and partly cooked by boiling. It is cleaned both with <ingredient>lime-water</ingredient> and with lye made from <ingredient>wood-ashes.</ingredient> When <ingredient>lime</ingredient> is used, it should be mixed with sufficient <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to make it entirely liquid. After the stomach is emptied, it should be sewed up so that no <ingredient>lime</ingredient> can penetrate it, and allowed to remain in the <ingredient>lime-water</ingredient> for half an hour before scraping it. The <ingredient>lime</ingredient> must be washed off, or it will burn the hands. When <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> are used, the stomach is to be thickly sprinkled with them after it is emptied, and washed in plenty of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> and it is put into a jar or <implement>firkin</implement> with enough <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to cover it, and remains in the lye thus formed for five or six hours before it is scraped. When neither <ingredient>lime</ingredient> nor <ingredient>ashes</ingredient> are available, the <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> must be repeatedly scalded with boiling <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> and scraped until it is clear: after that it must be laid in cold <ingredient>salted water</ingredient> for a week, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> being changed every day. In treating the <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> with <ingredient>lime-water</ingredient> or lye, the dark surface can be removed by several scaldings and scrapings. The <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> should then be left in <ingredient>salted cold water</ingredient> for twenty-four hours; after that it will be ready to be washed in fresh <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and boiled in <ingredient>salted boiling water,</ingredient> until it begins to look clear, and is tender enough to permit a broom-straw to be run through it. After <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> has been boiled, it can be kept in an earthen jar, covered with <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> equally mixed, with <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>buttermilk,</ingredient> or with <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> which has been scalded with plenty of <ingredient>spice,</ingredient> and poured upon the <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> while hot.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>tripe</ingredient> bought already prepared should be well washed in plenty of cold <ingredient>salted water,</ingredient> and then boiled until tender in <ingredient>salted boiling water;</ingredient> after that it can be pickled in scalding-hot spiced <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> or kept in <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> for several days.

At changing seasons, when the temperature is so variable, the keeping of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> becomes an important question to the housekeeper. There can be no better method than that employed by the old Pennsylvania Dutch housewives, when an animal was killed on the farm. After the portions of carcass suitable for salting were selected, and those chosen for immediate use set aside, the remainder was cut up in joints of available size, and either baked or roasted to the desired point,--rare, medium rare, or well done; stone jars or wooden tubs were selected to correspond with the size of the joints, a margin of about two inches in all directions being allowed. While the joints were being cooked, a large kettle of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> was melted. When the carcass was of <ingredient>pork,</ingredient> <ingredient>lard</ingredient> was made from the leaf; when of any other <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the <ingredient>suet</ingredient> was rendered. When the joints were cooked, each one was put into its jar or <implement>firkin,</implement> with a reversed plate in the 
 
<pb n="343" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=373"/>

bottom to keep the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from resting against it, and then the hot <ingredient>fat</ingredient> was poured around and over the <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> when the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> cools, it entirely excludes the air, and if the jars are covered and kept in a cool place, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will keep for several months. When required for use, the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is to be taken out of the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and quickly heated and served. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> can then be clarified by melting it in a kettle of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and allowing it to cool in a cake on the surface of the <ingredient>water;</ingredient> when the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is cold, the sediment of the under side of the cake can be scraped off, and the <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or dripping will then be ready to use. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> does not need clarifying if care is taken to separate from the rest that portion which has immediately surrounded the <ingredient>meat;</ingredient> this brown part of the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> can be used in making <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> for the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>

<p>THE roasts proper are given in this chapter, and also those dishes of birds and game which sometimes replace the roasts, and are more suitable for a dinner of several courses than the large joints of roast meat. The baked meats are given among the removes, together with the large boiled joints, and the boiled poultry. The smaller dishes of broiled, fried, and stewed meats are given among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> together with some of the smaller baked meats. The roasts should always be accompanied by some kind of green salad, if it is obtainable, because it greatly enhances the flavor of the meat. When wine is served with the roast, it may be either champagne or Burgundy. Sometimes the salad immediately follows the roast, and in that case it should be accompanied by some form of cheese.</p>

Until within a few years, there prevailed among American housekeepers an unfounded prejudice against the use of <ingredient>olive-oil</ingredient> in cooking. As a matter of fact, there is no cleaner <ingredient>fat</ingredient> than pure <ingredient>olive-oil.</ingredient> In warm weather a good <ingredient>oil</ingredient> is preferable to <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for frying; rancid <ingredient>oil</ingredient> should never be used.

When the birds are crisp and light brown, they are done. Care must be taken not to cook them slowly and long, for they will be dried and hardened by so doing. If the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> is smoking hot, about a couple of minutes will be long enough to fry the snipe; when they are brown, lay them on brown paper for a few moments to free them from <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> and then serve them hot. A few cresses, or some <ingredient>sour oranges</ingredient> sliced and dressed with <ingredient>salad-oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> will form a good garnish for the friend snipe.</p>

THE variety of salads depends solely upon the taste and ingenuity of the housekeeper, for the possibilities are illimitable. Those made of uncooked vegetables should always be fresh and crisp. If they are wilted in the least degree, they should be washed, without draining, and put into a cool, dark place to revive. Before using them, all decayed leaves should be removed, and the moisture absorbed from them by using a soft, clean towel. <ingredient>Cucumbers</ingredient> should be peeled, and laid in cold <ingredient>salted water</ingredient> for an hour before serving them, and then shaken dry in a clean towel, and dressed with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and plenty of good <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> <ingredient>Radishes</ingredient> should be similarly dressed. If they are very pungent in taste, a very little <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> will modify their sharpness.

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">MUSHROOMS.</purpose>

Many persons who like this excellent fungus are afraid to eat it because accidents have occurred from its use; but care will guard against such danger, both with fresh and canned <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient></p>
<p>There is no danger to be apprehended in using the canned <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> if, when the can is opened, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> look clean and perfect, of a light buff color, without any dark or defective spots; the liquid in the can should be clear, that is, not thick, and slightly colored by the <ingredient>mushrooms.</ingredient> The interior of the cans should be bright and clean, not dark or rusted; if there is the slightest appearance of discoloration or <ingredient>verdigris</ingredient> on the inside of the can, or near any joint in the tin in the can, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> contained in it might prove injurious. So far as the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> themselves are concerned, it is almost an impossibility for a poisonous one to be present in a can, because they are raised in so-called <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> caves or cellars, from <ingredient>seed</ingredient> or rather spawn, which is prepared from exhausted <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> beds: under these circumstances, it is almost impossible even for a poisonous <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> to spring in a bed; but if it did, its color, size, and general appearance would indicate its character, and it would at once be destroyed. The growers of <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> exercise a great care in the cultivation of the vegetable and 
 
<pb n="412" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=442"/>

in its preparation for the market. The few instances known of poisoning from the use of canned <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have been traced to carelessness in their preparation; the cooking having been done in unclean utensils, or in copper vessels from which the tin lining is worn, or the cooked <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have been allowed to stand over night in a metal vessel.</p>
<p>The fresh <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> which are brought to city markets are generally raised in <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> beds, by professional gardeners, who are perfectly conversant with all the characteristics of the vegetable; and so there is but little danger possible in using them. The fresh <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> sold during the summer and early fall in the markets are usually gathered in the fields and pastures by persons who know the varieties of fungi, and who discard all except the <emph rend="italic">agaricus campestris,</emph> or field <ingredient>mushroom.</ingredient></p>
<p>The fungi grow in form of a <emph rend="italic">pileus</emph> or cap, upon a short, stout stem, covered with a thin epidermis, and generally divided beneath into radiated gills, which are the <ingredient>seed-bearing</ingredient> organs. Form and appearance safely indicate the innocuous or harmful qualities of the <ingredient>mushrooms,</ingredient> but the test of tasting may be applied if one need be exercised. If a small part of the cap, eaten with a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> does not cause a burning or stinging sensation in the throat or stomach, and if the taste is pleasant and agreeable, the variety may be used. If this test shows the presence of a poisonous matter, by the burning sensation, the peril can be averted by a free use of <ingredient>common salt,</ingredient> followed by emetics and <ingredient>castor-oil.</ingredient> It should be remembered, that a perfectly good fungus, which is in excellent eating order when gathered, may decay and become unfit for food in a few hours; and therefore all species should be eaten or preserved when fresh. The most familiar of all the edible fungi is the agaric. With the best-known variety, the <emph rend="italic">agaricus campestris</emph> (the true meadow <ingredient>mushroom,</ingredient> or pink-gill), every lover of good dinners is acquainted,

as this is the <emph rend="italic">champignon</emph> cultivated extensively in Europe, and imported largely into this country in cans. It is often met with in our own markets. Its color is white, its gills pink when fresh, gradually turning brown after gathering. Its cap, from three to six inches in diameter, is plump and white, or cream-color, covered with a fine down; and its flesh is firm and <ingredient>white,</ingredient> with a pinkish tinge. The stem bears a well-defined white ring, which disappears as the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> dries.</p>
<p>In bright, open, sunny pastures, the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> disappear after the sun is high, and searchers for them seek their evanescent treasures early in the day: in more shaded localities, where there is much moisture, they sometimes grow until nightfall. In the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> caves and in the gardeners' hotbeds, where they are sheltered from the direct rays and heat of the sun, they seem to last longer, and to attain a larger growth; but their flavor is less intense than that of the outdoor <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient>: there is almost as much difference in the flavor of cultivated and field-grown <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> as there is between the flavor of poultry and <ingredient>game-birds</ingredient>. However, during an experiment made in raising <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> in the cellar of a New-York house, specimens from two to six inches diameter in the cap, firm in texture, and of full, high flavor, were raised, some of them growing in the beds for two or three days: it may be mentioned here, that from one spot about the size of a man's hand, in the angle of the wall, a group was gathered which weighed a pound and a half.</p>
<p>At first the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> appears as a tiny <ingredient>white</ingredient> knob, close to the ground; it quickly grows, the cap frequently being expanded in the morning and the decay complete by night, out of doors; the little white knob expands until the under side gradually opens, permitting the fringe-like gills to appear; as the cap breaks away from the stem, it leaves the rough ring where it joined the stem, and this gradually dries up. The gills are of a delicate pink, a sort of <ingredient>salmon-color</ingredient>; as 
 
<pb n="414" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=444"/>

the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> grows, the color of the gills deepens gradually through the shades of brown, and finally, when the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> is a day old, becomes quite black, and, as gradually, the substance of the <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> loses its first crisp, fleshy consistence, and becomes withered and fibrous; under favorable conditions of quick, dry, artificial heat, it slowly dries, ordinarily it decays. The flavor of the meadow <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> is sweet and nutty, while that of poisonous varieties is sharp and acrid. The poisonous <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> have not the characteristic pink gills of the harmless sort. A favorite popular test is to cook with the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> a <ingredient>white onion</ingredient> peeled, or a silver spoon, and, if either turns black, to avoid the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> as poisonous.</p>

A St. Honor&#201; cake is a combination of <ingredient>candied fruit,</ingredient> pastry, and <ingredient>cream</ingredient> custard. To make the pastry, put over the fire in a thick saucepan one pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> a quarter of a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and half an ounce of <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> when the <ingredient>water</ingredient> boils, throw in half a pound of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and beat the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> until it cleaves away from the sides of the saucepan; take the saucepan off the fire, let the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> cool for five minutes, and beat in eight <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> two at a time, thoroughly mixing them before adding more; the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> should be soft

Bake the little balls and ring in a moderate oven; when they are cool, cut a small place in each, and fill them with cold St. Honor&#201; custard.</p>

When a cake-pan is too shallow for the quantity of cake desired, or when the cake is so light that it is likely to rise above the top of the pan, it can be kept in shape by using<pb n="450" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=480"/>

a stiff glazed paper, cut as shown in the accompanying engraving, and thickly coated with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> before the cake is put into it; if the oven-heat is moderate, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> the paper from burning.</p>
<p>It may not be amiss to reprint the following hints for the successful baking of cake:-</p>
<p>In baking cake, the greatest care should be taken to guard against too great heat in the oven; a layer of sand on the bottom of the oven, about half an inch thick, is a safeguard against burning on the bottom; if the general heat is too great, the cake will burn, or crack on the top, before it can bake properly; if the oven is not hot enough, the cake will not rise properly. A very safe test of the heat is to put a spoonful of the cake dough or batter on a bit of buttered paper, and slip it into the oven; this may be done during

the final mixing of the cake, so that it will not have to stand after it is ready for the oven; if the little cake bakes evenly and quickly, without burning at the edge, the heat is right, and the large cake may be put into the oven.

In icing cakes where ornamentation is desired, the little paper cones shown in the accompanying engraving will be found useful; the tip of the second figure, <emph rend="italic">b,</emph> may be cut off to permit the escape of the icing; or a larger cut may be made and a metal tip inserted, as shown at the lower end of Fig. 3.

of the top, the top is folded down, as shown in Fig. 3, in such a way as to enclose the icing: then, by holding the full cone in the left hand, with the tip or bottom projecting beyond the thumb and forefinger, the icing can be pressed out at the tip by using the thumb of the right hand to force it downward in the cone. As the icing softens paper, it is well to use a rather stiff kind, and to make at least half a dozen cones before beginning to ice a cake. Small bags may be made of thick cotton cloth, with suitable metal tips fastened at the lower pointed end, to use for icing cakes.</p>

An <emph rend="italic">omelette souffl&#201;</emph> properly made is one of the most delicious of hot sweets. It is not difficult to make after its principles are understood, and yet it is seldom well made by ordinary cooks. Many dishes made from mixtures which contain <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>milk</ingredient> are called by the name of this one, but they are in no way entitled to such distinction. The true <emph rend="italic">omelette souffl&#201;</emph> contains only <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and the chosen flavoring. A tin-lined copper <emph rend="italic">souffl&#201;</emph>-pan, or a thick enamelled metal dish, which will quickly heat, and remain hot after it is taken from the oven, is required for cooking the omelet; spread the pan with <ingredient>cold butter,</ingredient> and see that the oven is quite hot before the omelet is made. Put in a quart bowl the <ingredient>yolks of three raw eggs,</ingredient> six heaping tablespoonfuls of pulverized <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and a teaspoonful of any good flavoring essence or <ingredient>cordial,</ingredient> and beat them to a smooth <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> beat the <ingredient>whites of six eggs</ingredient> to a stiff froth, and then quickly and lightly put the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> with the <ingredient>whites.</ingredient> This part of the operation requires a quick, deft hand.

Pastry forms such a large part of American so-called desserts, that it is fully illustrated and described; the pictures are copied from Gouff&#201;'s "Royal Confectionery Book;" and the method given is that of Car&#232;me, now followed by the best-trained masters of the art of cookery. A great deal of patience and considerable practice are required to reach the point of success with <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> but it is usually thought worth all necessary labor. It should always be made in the coolest available place, and in the intervals of doing other kitchen work, or the process will seem long and tiresome.</p>
<p>For those who do not wish to undertake <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> recipes are given for several easier and excellent pastries.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">PUFF-PASTE.</purpose>

The following recipe is reproduced from the author's "Baltimore Recipes;" the cuts which illustrate the process are copied from Gouff&#201;'s "Royal Confectionery," as are many others in this volume. A smooth hard-wood roller, and a very thick hard-wood or stone pastry-slab are needed, the stone being preferable because it keeps the pastry cool. First wet the slab with a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> lay upon it half a pound of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> work out all the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> by kneading it with both hands, and then keep out about an ounce of <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> fold the rest in a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed napkin, and lay it upon some ice. Second, dry the slab thoroughly, sift upon it half a pound of fine <ingredient>white flour,</ingredient> form this in a circle or well, as shown in the first cut, putting aside about two ounces to dust the slab with; into the well drop the ounce of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> reserved and the <ingredient>yolk of one egg,</ingredient> and work them to a <ingredient>cream</ingredient> with the tips of the fingers; to this gradually add the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>

<pb n="468" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=498"/>

from the well, with enough <ingredient>ice-cold water</ingredient> poured on from time to time as required to form a dough about the consistency of shortcake (about one cup of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> more or less, will be used, according to the body of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient>); now work the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> about on the slab until it leaves it clean and free, and does not cling to the fingers; take it up in a ball, and dust the slab slightly with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> lay on the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> flatten it down, and beat it with the roller for five minutes, turning and doubling it constantly, or knead it like <ingredient>bread</ingredient> for five minutes. This process toughens it so that the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will not break through in the subsequent manipulations. Third, raise the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> and dust the slab again with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> on it, and roll out to a square of about eight inches; turn the face of the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> or the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> which has been next the roller, down upon the slab, lay upon it the lump of <ingredient>cold butter,</ingredient> and fold the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> up and over it so as to cover every part; the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> may be enclosed in a square, as shown in the second cut, or the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> wrapped over it to form a ball; turn the ball thus formed upside down, roll it out gently and

evenly until the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is incorporated with the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> taking care not to break through the latter, as all the air-cells that can be gathered unbroken in the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> assist its rising; now turn the sheet of <ingredient>paste</ingredient> gently about on the slab, so that every part may be rolled to the same thickness of about one-quarter

of an inch; in turning the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> lift its outer edge, and gently lap it over the roller toward you, being sure not to tear it; roll it gently inward, keeping it around the roller, and lifting it clear from the board when you wish to turn it, or change its position in any way; when you wish to replace it upon the slab, gently unwind it from the roller, letting the face or part next the roller fall upon the slab. Fourth, the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is now ready for forming the flakes; to do this, turn the face down, fold it in three thicknesses lengthwise, making it three times as long as it is wide, as shown in the third cut; and then folding it again three times to make the square shown in the fourth cut; lay it in a long pan <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed, set this in a larger pan of ice, and place upon it a third pan filled with ice, so that the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will be completely surrounded with ice; let the pan stand for five minutes in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> or in the

coolest place you can command, always bearing in mind that the <implement>cooler</implement> the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is kept, the better it will be. Repeat the folding process described in the "fourth" part, six times in succession, every time setting the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in ice for five minutes, every time turning the face of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> with the folds down to the slab, and every time folding in an opposite direction, or the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will lie at one side, and the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will rise unevenly in baking. Fifth, to finish: After the sixth time of folding, roll the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> out to the thickness of one-quarter of an inch, and cut out in shape with a knife for pies, or for patties with a sharp <implement>tin cutter</implement> of the size required, marking in the centre of each patty a circle an inch in diameter with a small <implement>pastry-cutter.</implement> For small tarts or patties have the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> one-quarter of an inch thick; for large ones, or <emph rend="italic">vol-au-vents,</emph> have it about one-third thicker; for patties, use two layers of <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> put one over the other after cutting out, and wet the under layer with a soft brush dipped in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> brush the top of the second layer with an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> beaten up; this is called <emph rend="italic">dor&#201;e,</emph> or gilding, and the process gives the pastry a beautiful golden blaze. In forming <emph rend="italic">vol-au-vents</emph> or large pastries, use three or even four thicknesses of the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> putting them together as for patties, brushing the under layers with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and gilding the top. Sixth, and lastly, wet the <implement>baking-pan</implement> with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> instead of greasing it, lay the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> upon it, set it for five minutes upon the ice in order that the layers may adhere, and put in a moderate oven five minutes so that all the air-cells will have a chance to expand; then finish at a heat of about 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and be sure that the patties are done before taking them from the oven, or they will fall.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">GOOD PLAIN PASTRY.</purpose>

The secret of success in making pastry is to work quickly in a cool room, and to keep the pastry as cold as possible. Even in making plain pastry, only the best <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be used; the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be freshly sifted, and the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> worked with the hands in plenty of <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> until it assumes a waxy appearance and touch; if it is worked quickly and lightly, it will not stick to the hands; when the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is of the proper consistency, it should be patted with the hands into a cake about an inch thick, wrapped in a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed towel, and put in a dish set on ice in summer, or out of doors in winter, so that it may become quite cold while the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> is being prepared; allow half a pound of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to a pound of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> After the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> is sifted, mix with it a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and with a sharp knife chop into it one-third of the <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> then quickly mix with it enough <ingredient>ice-water</ingredient> to make a dough which does not stick to the hands; the mixing may be done with the knife or the hand, but it

must be done quickly; next, lightly <ingredient>flour</ingredient> a smooth pastry-board or <implement>marble slab,</implement> lay the dough on it, and with a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed roller roll it out about half an inch thick; cut the rest of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in thick slices, and lay it upon the dough, with spaces of about an inch between the slices; dust <ingredient>flour</ingredient> lightly over the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> and fold the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> over it in such a way as to completely enclose it; then gently roll it to the thickness of an inch, dust a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> over it, fold it several times, and again roll it out; if the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> shows anywhere through the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> put it in a <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed towel, and cool it for about fifteen minutes; then roll it out, fold it, and roll it again two or three times, and use it for pies.

The variety of hot and cold breads is very great; only specimens of different kinds can be given here, for there are enough to fill a large volume of American breads alone. Many breakfast and luncheon breads are included in this chapter. The dinner <ingredient>bread</ingredient> proper is a rather thick slice, or square piece, of <ingredient>white bread</ingredient> laid upon the napkin. French dinner <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is baked in a long roll so that there shall be plenty of crust. Of the fried cakes, only the fritters are suitable for dinners; they are in place among the <emph rend="italic">entr&#201;es,</emph> but often take the place of dessert at informal family dinners. The waffles are special breakfast and supper cakes, and the griddle-cakes are generally used at breakfast.</p>

These two <ingredient>bread</ingredient> recipes, like several others in this volume, are reproduced from the author's Baltimore Recipes, because the formulas have stood the test of several years' trial in the school of cookery.</p>
<p>Two methods are given, with personal preference for the <ingredient>compressed-yeast bread,</ingredient> because it is the quickest, and best <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> the nutriment of the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient></p>
<p>To make <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> boil two ounces of <ingredient>hops</ingredient> in two quarts of <ingredient>water</ingredient> for half an hour; strain the liquid, and cool it until it 
 
<pb n="487" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=517"/>

is only lukewarm, then add half a pound of <ingredient>brown sugar,</ingredient> two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and one pound of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> let this leaven ferment four days in a warm place, stirring it whenever it foams over the top of the jar in which it is placed; on the third day add to it three pounds of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> boiled and mashed; on the fourth day strain and bottle it, and keep it in a cool place.</p>
<p>To make <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> put seven pounds of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in a deep wooden bowl; in the centre of it put a tablespoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a teaspoonful of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> a gill of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> and sufficient <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to make a soft dough (about three pints); mix these ingredients with the hands until they form a smooth, shining dough; if necessary, use a little extra <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> only enough to facilitate the working of the dough; <ingredient>flour</ingredient> the bowl on the bottom and sides, so that the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will not stick to it, cover it with a thick towel folded several times, set it in a warm place protected from draughts, and let it rise over night. In the morning knead the dough fifteen minutes, divide it into four loaves, put them into <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed <implement>baking-pans,</implement> cover them with a folded towel, and set them in a warm place to rise twice their height; when they are so risen, prick them at the sides with a fork, and bake them in a moderate oven until a knitting or <implement>trussing needle</implement> can be run into them without being made sticky. Be sure that they are well done, but do not let them burn.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">COMPRESSED-YEAST BREAD.</purpose>

When it is possible to obtain fresh compressed <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> also called German <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> an excellent <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can be made in about two hours and a half; the rapidity of the leavening or "raising" the dough is advantageous, because less of the nutritive elements of the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> are lost than by following the long process. For two loaves of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> use three pounds of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> about a quart of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> two teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and 
 
<pb n="488" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=518"/>

an ounce of fresh compressed <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> dissolve the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in a pint of <ingredient>lukewarm water;</ingredient> stir into it sufficient <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to make a thick batter; cover the bowl containing the batter or sponge with a folded towel, and set it in a warm place to rise; if properly covered and heated, it will rise to a light foam in half an hour; then stir into it the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> dissolved in a little <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> add the rest of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and sufficient <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to make a dough stiff enough to knead; knead it five minutes, divide it into two loaves, put them in <ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed <implement>baking-pans,</implement> cover them with a folded towel, and set them in a warm place to rise twice their height; then bake them as directed in the preceding recipe.</p>
<p>In raising the sponge, be sure that the heat is not sufficient to "scald" or harden it, as that will prevent fermentation; therefore do not place it where the hand cannot be held with comfort; keep it covered from draughts. If when it is light it has become at all soured, as it sometimes will in summer, stir into it, before adding the balance of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> a saltspoonful of baking-<ingredient>soda</ingredient> dissolved in a very little <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p>The dough made for home-made <ingredient>bread</ingredient> can be baked as raised <ingredient>biscuit</ingredient> by kneading in with it a little <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or it can be boiled in soups and stews as raised dumplings.</p>
<p>To test the heat of the oven, follow the method of Jules Gouff&#201;, the celebrated <emph rend="italic">chef</emph> of the Paris Jockey Club: the "moderate oven" temperature is that degree of heat which will turn ordinary writing-paper dark yellow or buff, that is, the color of kindling-wood; put a sheet of paper in the oven, and close the door; if the paper blazes, the oven is too hot; arrange the dampers to lower the heat for ten minutes, then again test it with more paper; it may be necessary to try the temperature several times, but the time thus used is well spent.</p>

Just before bed-time put the sponge into a <ingredient>bread</ingredient> mixing-bowl with four quarts of sifted <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> a level tablespoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a small cupful of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and four tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>butter</ingredient> chopped or rubbed into the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> add enough <ingredient>lukewarm water</ingredient> to make a dough stiff enough to knead, and knead it for half an hour, using <ingredient>flour</ingredient> enough to prevent the dough sticking to the hands or the board. When the dough is smooth and shining, put it into a buttered bowl or pan large enough for it to double its volume in rising; <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the top of the dough, cover the bowl with a folded towel, and set it in a place free from draughts in summer, and in cold weather near enough to the fire to prevent any chilling of the dough.

<pb n="490" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=520"/>

oven, because the heat penetrates them so quickly that there is very little chance for the expansion to continue; the larger volume of loaves of dough excludes the heat longer, and they rise after they are put into the oven; the rolls should be put into a hot oven, and baked for about fifteen or twenty minutes; less heat is required for baking <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> and before the loaf is taken from the oven a sharp small knife or a bright steel needle should be run into the middle of the loaf, to make sure that it is thoroughly cooked; if there is the slightest particle of moisture on the steel when it is withdrawn from the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> the baking should be continued.</p>

<p>THE dessert proper consists of small cold sweets, frozen puddings either in moulds or <implement>paper cases,</implement> nuts, confectionery, black coffee, and candied fruits. Preserves, candied fruits, and jellies are included in this chapter, because they so often enter into the composition of <implement>dessert dishes.</implement> Many of the frozen puddings can be prepared at home, and the ices and creams also, if there is the proper freezing apparatus. The forms illustrated are French, but any American substitute will serve. The directions for making ices and creams were first published about two years ago, in one of the author's household series then appearing. They are good enough to give permanency to here, for by following them any careful person can produce at home some of the most elaborate of the confectioner's sweets: the forms only will differ, because confectioners have many very pretty individual moulds that are not found in ordinary households. The preparation of these novelties at home should always be undertaken in ample time, so that at dinner-time there shall be no difficulties to overcome at the last moments.</p>

The secret of making good ice-cream of any grade lies in the freezing. The old way of freezing <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> which is still in use among small confectioners, consisted of occasionally stirring the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> while it was freezing in a tin can set in a tub of ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> A more easy and expeditious method is within the reach of the average housekeeper in these days of patent freezers. The same principle underlies all the best known patents; i.e., the mixing of the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> by a wooden beater which revolves inside the can by the same motion that slightly changes the position of the can in the outer tub of ice and <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> This freezing-mixture should be composed of three parts of crushed ice to one of <ingredient>coarse salt,</ingredient> and care should be taken that it does not reach high enough around the sides of the can to penetrate to the interior, and so spoil the <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> formed in the outer tub by the melting of the freezing mixture need not be drawn off while the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is being frozen, unless it is likely to get into the 
 
<pb n="527" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=557"/>

can, because the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is intensely cold. If it is desired to pack the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> after it is frozen, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be drawn off, and enough more ice and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> packed around the can to nearly reach to the top. Ice-cream packed in this way can be kept over night, or longer if the freezing mixture is properly renewed. When ice-cream is "moulded," or packed in tin moulds of fancy shapes, all the openings should be closed with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or oiled paper closed about the apertures of the mould with <ingredient>paste</ingredient> or <ingredient>gum-tragacanth</ingredient>.</p>
<p>Ice-creams of the most ordinary sort are made of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> thickened with <ingredient>arrowroot</ingredient> or <ingredient>corn-starch</ingredient> in the proportion of a tablespoonful to a quart, dissolved in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> and then boiled in the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> which is cooled, sweetened, and flavored before it is frozen.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">PRESERVES AND JELLIES.</purpose>

The making of <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> and <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> was formerly much more the test of excellence among housekeepers than it is now. So many preserved and canned <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> are to be bought at reasonable prices, and of varying qualities, that even careful housekeepers use them. For the guidance of those who prefer the home-made kinds, two points may be emphasized: i.e., the keeping of <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> depends both upon the proportion of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> used, and their thorough cooking; and the excellence of <ingredient>jellies,</ingredient> upon the clear quality of the <ingredient>fruit-juice</ingredient>, and the boiling of the <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> until a little of it, cooled on a saucer, hardens or thickens to the desired consistency.</p>
<p>The general principles given in one recipe apply to all 
 
<pb n="534" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=564"/>

the others of a similar kind. All <ingredient>jellies</ingredient> and <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> should be entirely closed from the air, and kept in a cool, dark place.

As served usually, it is peeled, sliced, and sugared before it is sent to the table; but more of its flavor and <ingredient>juice</ingredient> are preserved if it is served with the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> on, in English fashion, or in West-<ingredient>Indian</ingredient> style, as directed below; either way it can easily be handled, for a knife and fork are always required to cut it readily, a teaspoon being quite inadequate for that purpose. Perfectly ripe <ingredient>pineapples</ingredient> do not really require <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> but as many prefer to use it, it is well to place a dish of <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> on the table with the <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient> The beauty of the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is in its shape and color, and these are lost if it is entirely cut up before being served. In England, where <ingredient>pineapples</ingredient> are always the greatest luxuries, they are cut in horizontal slices with a very sharp, thin-bladed knife, the slices being kept together, and the crown being left on the <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> which is placed in the centre of a dish of assorted <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> as the chief ornament of the dessert. The <ingredient>pineapple</ingredient> can also be cut from the crown to the base in wedge-shaped slices, the middle being left just entire enough to hold the slices in place until they are needed for serving; they can then be readily dislodged with a thin, sharp knife, and served with a silver knife and fork.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">BEVERAGES, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE DIET OF INVALIDS AND CHILDREN.</hd>
<p>The number of beverages is proportionate to the proverbial thirst of mankind; but, in the limited space available, few can be mentioned. After the usual domestic drinks of tea, coffee, and chocolate or cocoa, some good temperance beverages are given, together with fruit sirups and cordials, upon which they may be based. Then follow a few of the drinks usually ordered by physicians in illness and convalescence; and some of the cups and punches generally used for garden-parties.</p>
<p>The diet for invalids and children can only be outlined here, for lack of space, and because it is treated exhaustively in a larger work by the author in the Harpers' press.</p>
<p>Dishes for invalids should combine nutriment with digestibility, and be attractive and appetizing; above all, their ingredients should be perfectly fresh; and not many ingredients should enter into one dish. Among the dishes suitable for invalids included in this book are: clear soup, <emph rend="italic">bouillon,</emph> chicken and rice soup, cream oyster and clam soups, roast and broiled oysters, boiled and broiled salmon, Girard trout, fresh mackerel broiled, poached and shirred eggs and omelets, sweetbreads broiled and baked, tripe broiled and stewed, broiled chops and steaks, broiled chicken and game birds, calf's-foot and wine jellies, and some of the delicate puddings. Fruit must be subject to the doctor's selection; 
 
<pb n="570" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=600"/>

as also must be special diets of milk, beef, etc., because all changes in diet are to be carefully made. Some few good dishes are added to those already mentioned.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">FILTERING WATER OR SIRUP.</purpose>

When <ingredient>drinking-water</ingredient> is muddy, it can be cleared by filtering it as shown in the accompanying pictures: the first one represents the folding of a round piece of <implement>filtering-paper,</implement> such as can be procured at the druggist's; the folded paper is laid inside a funnel set in the <ingredient>neck</ingredient> of a <implement>decanter,</implement> and the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is allowed to run through the paper slowly. If smooth <implement>decanters</implement> or <emph rend="italic">carafes</emph> are used, the <ingredient>water</ingredient> can be frozen in them after it is filtered, by following the directions given in the recipe for frozen <emph rend="italic">carafes.</emph> For filtering sirup, a clean piece of thin chamois is excellent; the chamois should be washed in <ingredient>borax-water</ingredient> every time it is used, and very carefully rinsed in clear <ingredient>water;</ingredient> if borax is not at hand, a small piece of washing-<ingredient>soda</ingredient> may be dissolved in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which the chamois is washed, and it can then be thoroughly rinsed.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="italic" placement="heading">COFFEE.</purpose>

The making of good <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> depends upon two operations; the straining to make it clear, and the infusion to <ingredient>extract</ingredient> its flavor and aroma. It is possible to make clear <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> without either straining or so-called settling; this point has been fully discussed in other works by this author, so that it need not be repeated here. <ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> may be strained by using <implement>coffee-pots</implement> containing <implement>percolators</implement> or wire-gauze strainers, or by enclosing the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in cotton bags of different shapes; actually <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> is then to be poured upon it; but it must not be boiled unless it is wanted black and bitter, because boiling extracts its tannic acid.

The form of black <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> called <emph rend="italic">gloria</emph> by the French is rather an accident than a deliberately composed beverage. In all French households, it is the custom to serve cognac among the <emph rend="italic">liqueurs</emph> after dinner, with the black <ingredient>coffee;</ingredient> and so far does the custom now prevail in this country, that in many of the hotels and restaurants a <emph rend="italic">demi-tasse,</emph> or small glass of <ingredient>brandy,</ingredient> accompanies the small cup of black <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> served after dinner, unless <emph rend="italic">caf&#201; &#224; la cr&#234;me</emph> has been specified. After the black <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is very much sweetened, a teaspoonful of <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> is poured upon the surface, and lighted; when the <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> is nearly burned away, the flame is blown out, and the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> drank.

To prepare the granula, use stale pieces of <ingredient>Graham</ingredient> or <ingredient>brown bread;</ingredient> cut the <ingredient>stale bread</ingredient> in pieces of equal thickness, put them into the oven, and bake them until they are light brown; then roll them with a rolling-pin until they break into small crumbs; sift the crumbs through a coarse sieve to insure uniformity, rolling and sifting again the crumbs too large to pass through the sieve the first time; keep the granula in air-tight jars or boxes in a dry place, and use it as required; it will keep as well as <ingredient>cracker-dust</ingredient>. Any of the recipes for preparing gruels and panadas will serve for the preparation of granula, or it may be used to thicken <ingredient>hot milk</ingredient> or soup for invalids or children.</p>

<hd align="center" rend="italic">DISHES FOR CHILDREN.</hd>
<p>The physical basis of diet for children is clearly defined in the author's "Dietary for Schools," which was written at the suggestion of the Hon. John Eaton, U.S. Commissioner of Education, and published as Circular No. 4, series of 1879, of the Bureau of Education, Department of the Interior. It is reprinted in the late editions of the author's "Cooking-school Text-book." The following points are extracted from the dietary:--</p>
<p>Every care must be taken to supply children with a variety 
 
<pb n="590" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=620"/>

and abundance of nutritious and digestible food, in which fruit, the cereals, vegetables, milk, mutton, beef, and poultry should be included; together with simple sweets, and plain puddings chiefly composed of milk,eggs, and flour or bread. The character of the diet should be varied with the seasons; cold weather permitting the use of plenty of substantial food, and summer making advisable an abundance of ripe and fresh fruit and vegetables. Tea,coffee, and stimulants should be avoided, and plenty of cool fresh water used as the habitual drink. The fact should be remembered, that milk is not a beverage but a food, of which the greater part becomes solid after it is drank. With the exception of salt, the condiments should be used sparingly. The breakfast should be early and plentiful, and when any drink but water is desired, warm milk and water, or cocoa may be used. Midday dinners should be varied and always hot,--indeed, all food is most digestible when warm,--composed of some plain meat dish, at least two vegetables, and a simple pudding. Soup is invaluable for children, but it must be plain. The supper should be light and nutritious, given about two hours before retiring, and may include warm bread-and-milk, any form of porridge and milk, custard, bread and butter, simple stewed fruits, and either cool water or cocoa as a beverage.</p>
<p>If children are very active, and grow fast, their appetites will always be keen, and should be completely satisfied with abundance of well-chosen food. When children get hungry oftener than the recurrence of the regular family meals, they should be supplied with a light repast of digestible character; indeed, it is well to give them a regular luncheon of bread and butter, or bread and milk, in the mid-forenoon, and again about three or four o'clock if their supper does not come before six o'clock. If a child is hungry, it cannot be well or happy; and the rapid growth of youth causes a 
 
<pb n="591" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pach&#38;PageNum=621"/>

constant demand to be made upon the vitality supplied to the system by food.</p>
<p>When children show any marked preference for special foods, care should be taken to modify their tastes so that they may always eat a sufficient variety to obtain from food the elements requisite to a well-balanced physical development. Every abnormal appetite should be modified by judicious control on the part of the parents or nurse, if the child is to receive the care its helpless condition imposes upon its natural protectors: they are as much responsible for its physical well-being as for its moral rectitude.</p>
<p>These outlines will serve to guard those having the care of children, from making the mistakes which too often entail a life of weakness or suffering as the consequence equally of injudicious indulgence, and of neglect of the most ordinary rules of health.</p>
