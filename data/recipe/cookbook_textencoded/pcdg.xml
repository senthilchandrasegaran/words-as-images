<p>THE aim of this book is to indicate how to serve dishes, and to entertain
company at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as to give cooking receipts.
Too many receipts are avoided, although quite enough are furnished for any
practical cook-book. There are generally only two or three really good modes of
cooking a material, and one becomes bewildered and discouraged in trying to
select and practice from books which contain often from a thousand to three
thousand receipts.</p>
<p>No claim is laid to originality. "Receipts which have not stood the test of
time and experience are of but little worth." The author has willingly availed
herself of the labors of others, and, having carefully compared existing
works--adding here and subtracting there, as experience dictated--and having
also pursued courses of study with cooking teachers in America and in Europe,
she hopes that she has produced a simple and practical book, which will enable
a family to live well and in good style, and, at the same time, with reasonable
economy.</p>
<p>The absence from previous publications of reliable
<pb n="preface" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=16"/> information as to the manner of serving
meals has been noticed. Fortunately, the fashionable mode is one calculated to
give the least anxiety and trouble to a hostess.</p>
<p>Care has been taken to show how it is possible with moderate means to keep a
hospitable table, leaving each reader for herself to consider the manifold
advantages of making home, so far as good living is concerned, comfortable and
happy.</p>

<pb n="NONE OF THE ABOVE" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=19"/><hd align="center">PRACTICAL
COOKING,<lb/>AND<lb/>DINNER GIVING.</hd><chapter class1="etiquette"><hd
align="center">SETTING THE TABLE AND SERVING THE DINNER.</hd>
<p>AN animated controversy for a long time existed as to the best mode of
serving a dinner. Two distinct and clearly defined styles, known as the English
and Russian, each having its advantages and disadvantages, were the subject of
contention. It is perhaps fortunate that a compromise between them has been so
generally adopted by the fashionable classes in England, France, and America as
to constitute a new style, which supersedes, in a measure, the other two.</p>
<p>In serving a dinner 
<emph rend="italic">&#225; la Russe,</emph> the table is decorated by placing
the dessert in a tasteful manner around a centre-piece of flowers. This
furnishes a happy mode of gratifying other senses than that of taste; for while
the appetite is being satisfied, the flowers exhale their fragrance, and give
to the eye what never fails to please the refined and cultivated guest.</p>
<p>In this style the dishes are brought to the table already carved, and ready
for serving, thus depriving the cook of the power to display his decorative
art, and the host of his skill in carving. Each dish is served as a separate
course, only one vegetable being allowed for a course, unless used merely for
the purpose of garnishing.</p>
<p>The English mode is to set the whole of each course, often containing many
dishes, at once upon the table. Such dishes<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=20"/> as
require carving, after having been once placed on the dinner-table, are removed
to a side-table, and there carved by an expert servant. Serving several dishes
at one time, of course, impairs the quality of many, on account of the
impossibility of keeping them hot. This might, in fact, render some dishes
quite worthless.</p>
<p>And now, before giving the details of serving a dinner on the newer
compromise plan, I will describe the "setting" or arranging of the table, which
may be advantageously adopted, whatever the mode of serving.</p>
<p>In the first place, a round table five feet in diameter is the best
calculated to show off a dinner. If of this size, it may be decorated to great
advantage, and conveniently used for six or eight persons, without
enlargement.</p>
<p>Put a thick <implement>baize</implement> under the table-cloth. This is
quite indispensable. It prevents noise, and the finest and handsomest
table-linen looks comparatively thin and sleazy on a bare table.</p>
<p>Do not put starch in the napkins, as it renders them stiff and disagreeable,
and only a very little in the table-cloth. They should be thick enough, and, at
the same time, of fine enough texture, to have firmness without starch. Too
much can not be said as to the pleasant effect of a dinner, when the
table-linen is of spotless purity, and the dishes and silver are perfectly
bright.</p>
<p>Although many ornaments may be used in decorating the table, yet nothing is
so pretty and so indicative of a refined taste as flowers. If you have no 
<implement rend="italic">&#233;pergne</implement> for them, use a 
<implement rend="italic">compotier</implement> or raised dish, with a plate
upon the top, to hold cut flowers; or place flower-pots with blossoming plants
on the table. A net-work of wire, painted green, or of wood or crochet work,
may be used to conceal the roughness of the flower-pot. A still prettier
arrangement is to set the pot in a 
<emph rend="italic">jardini&#232;re</emph> vase.</p>
<p>At a dinner party, place a little bouquet by the side of the plate of each
lady, in a small glass or silver <implement>bouquet-holder.</implement> At the
gentlemen's plates put a little bunch of three or four flowers, called a 
<emph rend="italic">boutonnt&#232;re;</emph> in the folds of the napkin. As
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=21"/> soon as the gentlemen are seated at table, they
may attach them to the left lapel of the coat.</p>
<p>Place the dessert in two or four fancy 
<implement>dessert-dishes</implement>around the centre-piece, which,
by-the-way, should not be high enough to obstruct the view of persons sitting
at opposite sides of the table. The dessert will consist of fruits, fresh or
candied, preserved ginger, or preserves of any kind, fancy cakes, candies,
nuts, raisins, etc.</p>
<p>Put as many knives, forks, and spoons by the side of the plate of each
person as will be necessary to use in all the different courses. Place the
knives and spoons on the right side, and the forks on the left side, of the
plates. This saves the trouble of replacing a knife and fork or spoon as each
course is brought on. Many prefer the latter arrangement, as they object to the
appearance of so many knives, etc., by the sides of a plate. This is, of
course, a matter of taste. I concede the preferable appearance of the latter
plan, but confess a great liking for any arrangement which saves extra work and
confusion.</p>
<p>Place the napkin, neatly folded, on the plate, with a piece of bread an inch
thick, and three inches long, or a small cold bread roll, in the folds or on
the top of the napkin.</p>
<p>Put a glass for water, and as many wine-glasses as are necessary at each
plate. Fill the water-glass just before the dinner is announced, unless
caraffes are used. These are kept on the table all the time, well filled with
water, one caraffe being sufficient for two or three persons. All the wine
intended to be served decanted should be placed on the table, conveniently
arranged at different points.</p>
<p>At opposite sides of the table place <implement>salt and pepper
stands,</implement> together with the different fancy spoons, crossed by their
side, which may be necessary at private dinners, for serving dishes.</p>
<p>Select as many plates as will be necessary for all the different courses.
Those intended for cold dishes, such as salad, dessert, etc., place on the
sideboard, or at any convenient place. Have those plates intended for dessert
already prepared, with a <implement>finger-bowl</implement> on each plate. The 
<implement>finger-glasses</implement> should be half filled with water, with a
slice of lemon in each, or a geranium<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=22"/> leaf and one
flower, or a little 
<emph rend="italic">boutonni&#232;re:</emph> a sprig of lemon-verbena is
pretty, and leaves a pleasant odor on the fingers after pressing it in the
bowl. In Paris, the water is generally warm, and scented with peppermint.</p>
<p>Some place folded <implement>fruit-napkins</implement> under each 
<implement>finger-bowl;</implement> others have little fancy net-work mats,
made of thread or crochet cotton, which are intended to protect handsome
painted <implement>dessert-plates</implement> from scratches which the 
<implement>finger-bowls</implement> might possibly make.</p>
<p>The warm dishes--not 
<emph rend="italic">hot</emph> dishes--keep in a tin closet or on the top shelf
of the range until the moment of serving. A plate of bread should also be on
the sideboard.</p>
<p>Place the <implement>soup-tureen</implement> (with soup that has been
brought to the boiling-point just before serving) and the 
<implement>soup-plates</implement> before the seat of the hostess.</p>
<p>Dinner being now ready, it should be announced by the butler or dinning-room
maid. Never ring a bell for a meal. Bells do very well for country inns and
steamboats, but in private houses the 
<emph rend="italic">m&#233;nage</emph> should be conducted with as little
noise as possible.</p>
<p>With these preliminaries, one can see that it requires very little trouble
to serve the dinner. There should be no confusion or anxiety about it. It is a
simple routine. Each dish is served as a separate course. The butler first
places the pile of plates necessary for the course before the host or hostess.
He next sets the dish to be served before the host or hostess, just beyond the
pile of plates. The soup, salad, and dessert should be placed invariably before
the hostess, and every other dish before the host. As each plate is ready, the
host puts it upon the small <implement>salver</implement> held by the butler,
who then with his own hand places this and the other plates in a similar manner
on the table before each of the guests. If a second dish is served in the
course, the butler, putting in it a spoon, presents it on the left side of each
person, allowing him to help himself. As soon as any one has finished with his
plate, the butler should remove it immediately, without waiting for others to
finish. This would take too much time. When all the plates are removed, the
butler should bring on the next course. It is not necessary to use
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=23"/> the <implement>crumb-scraper</implement> to clean
the cloth until just before the dessert is served. He should proceed in the
same manner to distribute and take off the plates until the dessert is served,
when he can leave the room.</p>
<p>This is little enough every-day ceremony for families of the most moderate
pretensions, and it is also enough for the finest dinner party, with the simple
addition of more waiters, and distribution of the work among them. It is well
that this simple ceremony should be daily observed, for many reasons. The
dishes themselves taste better; moreover, the cook takes more pride, and is
more particular to have his articles well cooked, and to present a better
appearance, when each dish is in the way subjected to a special regard: and is
it not always preferable to have a few well-cooked dishes to many indifferently
and carelessly prepared? At the same time, each dish is in its perfection, hot
from the fire, and ready to be eaten at once; then, again, one has the benefit
of the full flavor of the dish, without mingling it with that of a multiplicity
of others. There is really very little extra work in being absolutely
methodical in every-day living. With his habit, there ceases to be any anxiety
in entertaining. There is nothing more distressing at a dinner company than to
see a hostess ill at ease, or to detect an interchange of nervous glances
between her and the servants. A host and hostess seem insensibly to control the
feelings of all the guests, it matters not how many there may be. In
well-appointed houses, a word is not spoken at the dinner between the hostess
and attendants. What necessity, when the servants are in the daily practice of
their duties?</p>
<p>If one has nothing for dinner but soup, hash, and lettuce, put them on the
table in style: serve them in three courses, and one will imagine it a much
better dinner than if carelessly served.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that the above is the rule prescribed for every-day
living. With large dinner parties, the plan might be changed, in one respect, 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> in having the dishes, in courses, put on the
table for exhibition, and then taken off, to be carved quickly and delicately
at a side-table by an experienced butler. This gives the host time to entertain
his guests at his ease, instead<pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=24"/> of being absorbed
in the fatiguing occupation of carving for twelve or fourteen people.</p>
<p>These rules in France constitute an invariable and daily custom for private
dinners, as well as for those of greater pretensions. Every thing is served
there also as a separate course, even each vegetable, unless used as a garnish.
In America and England this plan is not generally liked, although in both these
countries it is adopted by many. Americans like, at least, one vegetable with
each substantial, a taste, it is to be hoped, that will not be changed by the
dictates of fashion. Then, if dishes are to be carved at a side-table, the
one-vegetable plan causes the placing of the principal dish on the table before
carving to appear more sensible.</p>
<p>When the butler places a dish on the table, and tarries a moment or so for
every one to look at it, if it does not happen to be so very attractive in
appearance the performance seems very absurd; but when, after putting on the
substantial dish, he places a vegetable dish at the other end of the table, his
taking the substantial to carve seems a more rational proceeding.</p>
<p>I would suggest, when there is only one dish for a course, which it to be
taken off the table to be carved, that the dish should be put on first; then,
that the butler should return for the plates, instead of placing the plates on
first, as should be done in all other cases.</p>
<p>At small dinners, I would not have the butler to be carver. It is a graceful
and useful accomplishment for a gentleman to know how to carve well. At small
dinners, where the dishes can not be large, the attendant labor must be light;
and, in this case, does it not seem more hospitable and home-like for the
gentleman to carve himself? Does it not disarm restraint, and mark the only
difference there is between home and hotel dinners?</p>
<p>In "Gastronomie," M. M. believes in a compromise on the carving question. He
say, "There were professional carvers, and this important art was anciently
performed at the sound of music, and with appropriate gesticulations. We wish
our modern gourmands would follow the very good example of Trimalchio
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=25"/> in this respect, and, if they must have their
viands carved on the sideboard by servants, take care that, like his carvers,
they are trained to his art. We shall take the opportunity of entering our
protest against an innovation which is going too far. That some of the more
bulky pieces, the 
<emph rend="italic">pi&#232;ces de r&#233;sistance,</emph> should be placed
on the sideboard, well and good, though even to this Addison objected, and not
without reason; but that the fish and the game should be both bestowed and
distributed, like rations to paupers, by attendants, who, for the most part,
can not distinguish between the head and the tail of a mullet, the flesh and
fin of a turbot, etc., is enough to disturb the digestion of the most tolerant
gastronome. We must say that we like to see our dinner, especially the fish,
and to see every part of it, in good hands."</p>
<p>Then, again, without paying a high price, one can not secure a waiter who is
a good carver. I am almost inclined to say one must possess the luxury of a
French waiter for carving at the side-table. English waiters are good. The
Irish are generally too awkward. Negroes are too slow. The French are both
graceful and expeditious.</p>
<p>Well, what can be done, then, when one has a dinner party, with no expert
carver, and the dishes are too large for the host to attempt? I would advise in
this case that the dinner should be served from the side. A very great majority
of large and even small dinners are served in this manner.</p>
<p>The table, as usual, is decorated with flowers, fruits, etc., but the
dishes(<emph rend="italic">plats</emph>) are not placed upon it; consequently
the host has no more duty to perform in the serving of the dinner than the
guest. A plate is placed on the table before each person, then the dish,
prettily decorated or neatly carved, if necessary, is presented to the left
side, so that each person may help himself from the dish. When these plates are
taken off, they are replaced by clean ones, and the dish of the next course is
presented in like manner. Many prefer to serve every course from the side, as I
have just indicated; others make an exception of the dessert, which the hostess
may consider a pretty acquisition to the table, while the dish should not be an
awkward one to serve.</p><pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=26"/>
<p>Some proper person should be stationed in the kitchen or butler's pantry to
carve and to see that the dishes are properly decorated. If the hostess should
apprehend unskillfulness in carving, the dinner might be composed of chops,
ribs, birds, etc., which require no cutting.</p>
<p>There are several hints about serving the table, which I will now specify
separately, in order to give them the prominence they deserve.</p>
<p>1st. The waiters should be expeditious without seeming to be in a hurry. A
dragging dinner is most tiresome. In France, the dishes and plates seem to be
changed almost by magic. An American senator told me that at a dinner at the
Tuileries, at which he was present, twenty-five courses were served in an hour
and a half. The whole entertainment, with the after-dinner coffee, etc., lasted
three hours. Upon this occasion, a broken dish was never presented to the view
of a guest. One waiter would present a dish, beautifully garnished or
decorated; and if the guest signified assent, a plate with some of the same
kind of food was served him immediately from the broken dish at the
side-table.</p>
<p>Much complaint has been made by persons accustomed to dinners abroad of the
tediousness of those given in Washington and New York, lasting, as they often
do, from three to five hours. It is an absolute affliction to be obliged to sit
for so long a time at table.</p>
<p>2d. Never overload a plate nor oversupply a table. It is a vulgar
hospitality. At a small dinner, no one should hesitate to ask for more, if he
desires it; it would only be considered a flattering tribute to the dish.</p>
<p>At large companies, where there is necessarily a greater variety of dishes,
the most voracious appetite must be satisfied with a little of each. Then, do
not supply more than is absolutely needed; it is a foolish and unfashionable
waste. "Hospitality is not to be measured by the square inch and calculated by
cubic feet of beef or mutton."</p>
<p>At a fashionable dinner party, if there are twelve or fourteen guests, there
should be twelve or fourteen birds, etc., served on the table--one for each
person. If uninvited persons should<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=27"/> call, the
servant could mention at the door that madam has company at dinner. A sensible
person would immediately understand that the general machinery would be upset
by making an appearance. At small or private dinners, it would be, of course,
quite a different thing.</p>
<p>The French understand better than the people of any other nation how to
supply a table. "Their small family dinners are simply gems of perfection.
There is plenty for every person, yet every morsel is eaten. The flowers or
plants are fresh and odoriferous; the linen is a marvel of whiteness; the
dishes are few, but perfect of their kind."</p>
<p>When you invite a person to a family dinner, do not attempt too much. It is
really more elegant to have the dinner appear as if it were an every-day affair
than to impress the guest, by an ostentatious variety, that it is quite an
especial event to ask a friend to dinner. Many Americans are deterred from
entertaining, because they think they can not have company without a vulgar
abundance, which is, of course, as expensive and troublesome as it is coarse
and unrefined.</p>
<p>For reasonable and sensible people, there is no dinner more satisfactory
than one consisting first of a soup, then a fish, garnished with boiled
potatoes, followed by a roast, also garnished with one vegetable; perhaps an 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;e,</emph> always a salad, some cheese, and a
dessert. This, well cooked and neatly and quietly served, is a stylish and good
enough dinner for any one, and is within the power of a gentleman or lady of
moderate means to give. "It is the exquisite quality of a dinner or a wine that
pleases us, not the multiplicity of dishes or vintages."</p>
<p>3d. Never attempt a new dish with company--one that you are not entirely
sure of having cooked in the very best manner.</p>
<p>4th. Care must be taken about selecting a company for a dinner party, for
upon this depends the success of the entertainment. Always put the question to
yourself, when making up a dinner party, Why do I ask him or her? And unless
the answer be satisfactory, leave him or her out. Invite them on some other
occasion. If they are not sensible, social, unaffected, and clever people, they
will not only not contribute to the agreeability of the dinner, but will
positively be a serious impediment<pb n="22" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=28"/> to
conversational inspiration and the general feeling of ease. Consequently, one
may consider it a compliment to be invited to a dinner party.</p>
<p>5th. Have the distribution of seats at table so managed, using some tact in
the arrangement, that there need be no confusion, when the guests enter the
dining-room, about their being seated. If the guest of honor be a lady, place
her at the right of the host; if a gentleman, at the right of the hostess.</p>
<p>If the dinner company be so large that the hostess can not easily place her
guests without confusion, have a little card on each plate bearing the name of
the person who is to occupy the place. Plain cards are well enough; but the
French design (they are designed in this country also) beautiful cards for the
purpose, illustrated with varieties of devices: some are rollicking cherubs
with capricious antics, who present different tempting viands; autumn leaves
and delicate flowers in chromo form pretty surroundings for the names on
others; yet the designs are so various on these and the bill-of-fare cards that
each hostess may seek to find new ones, while frequent dinner-goers may have
interesting collections of these mementoes, which may serve to recall the
occasions in after-years.</p>
<p>6th. If the dinner is intended to be particularly fine, have bills of fare,
one for each person, written on little sheets of paper smoothly cut in half, or
on French bill-of-fare cards, which come for the purpose. If expense is no
object, and you entertain enough to justify it, have cards for your own use
especially engraved. Have your crest, or perhaps a monogram, at the top of the
card, and forms for different courses following, so headed that you have only
to fill out the space with the special dishes for the occasion. I will give the
example of a form. The forms are often seen on the dinner-cards; yet, perhaps,
they are as often omitted, when the bills of fare are written, like those given
at the end of the book.</p>
<p>Bills of fare are generally written in French. It is a pity that our own
rich language is inadequate to the duties of a fashionable bill of fare,
especially when, perhaps, all the guests do not understand the Gallic tongue,
and the bill of fare(<emph rend="italic">menu</emph>) for their accommodation
might as well be written in<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=29"/> Choctaw. I will
arrange a table with French names of dishes for the aid of those preferring the
French bills of fare. I would say that some tact might be displayed in choosing
which language to employ.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a
menu printed with the following text (in list format): MENU. Diner du 15
F&#233;vrior. Potages. Poissons. Hors-d'&#230;uvres. Relev&#233;s.
Entr&#233;es. R&#244;tis. Entrem&#234;ts. Glaces.
Dessert.</description></illustration>
<p>If you are entertaining a ceremonious company, with tastes for the
frivolities of the world, or, perhaps, foreign embassadors, use unhesitatingly
the French bills of fare; but practical uncles and substantial persons of
learning and wit, who, perhaps, do not appreciate the merits of languages which
they do not understand, might consider you demented to place one of these
effusions before them. I would advise the English bills of fare on these
occasions.</p>
<p>7th. The attendants at table should make no noise. They should wear slippers
or light boots. "Nothing so distinguishes the style of perfectly appointed
houses from vulgar imitations as the quiet, self-possessed movements of the
attendants." No word should be spoken among them during dinner, nor should they
even seem to notice the conversation of the company at table.</p>
<p>8th. The waiter should wear a dress-coat, white vest, black trousers, and
white necktie; the waiting-maid, a neat black alpaca or a clean calico dress,
with a white apron.</p>
<p>9th. Although I would advise these rules to be generally followed, 
<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=30"/> yet it is as pleasant a change to see an
individuality of a characteristic taste displayed in the setting of the table
and the choice of dishes as in the appointments of our houses or in matters of
toilet. At different seasons the table might be changed to wear a more
appropriate garb. It may be solid, rich, and showy, or simple, light, and
fresh.</p>
<p>10th. Aim to have a variety or change in dishes. It is as necessary to the
stomach and to the enjoyment of the table as is change of scene for the mind.
Even large and expensive state dinners become very monotonous when one finds
everywhere the same choice of dishes. Mr. Walker, in his "Original," says: "To
order dinner is a matter of invention and combination. It involves novelty,
simplicity, and taste; whereas, in the generality of dinners, there is no
character but that of routine, according to the season."</p>
<p>11th. Although many fashionable dinners are of from three or four hours'
duration, I think every minute over two hours is a "stately durance vile."
After that time, one can have no appetite; conversation must be forced. It is
preferable to have the dinner a short one than a minute too long. If one rises
from a fine dinner wearied and satiated, the memory of the whole occasion must
be tinged with this last impression.</p>
<p>12th. There is a variety of opinions as to who should be first served at
table. Many of the 
<emph rend="italic">haut monde</emph> insist that the hostess should be first
attended to. Once, when visiting a family with an elegant establishment, who,
with cultivated tastes and years of traveling experience, prided themselves on
their 
<emph rend="italic">savoir faire,</emph> one of the members said, "Yes, if
Queen Victoria were our guest, our sister, who presides at table, should always
be served first." The custom originated in ancient times, when the hospitable
fashion of poisoning was in vogue. Then the guests preferred to see the hostess
partake of each dish before venturing themselves. Poisoning is not now the
order of the day, beyond what is accomplished by rich pastry and plum puddings.
If there be but one attendant, the lady guest sitting at the right of the host
or the oldest lady should be first served. There are certain natural instincts
of propriety which fashion or custom can not regulate. As soon as the second
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=31"/> person is helped, there should be no further
waiting before eating.</p>
<p>13th. Have chairs of equal height at table. Perhaps every one may know by
experience the trial to his good humor in finding himself perched above or sunk
below the general level.</p>
<p>14th. The selection of china for the table offers an elegant field in which
to display one's taste. The most economical choice for durability is this: put
your extra money in a handsome dessert set, all (except the plates) of which
are displayed on the table all the time during dinner; then select the
remainder of the service in plain white, or white and gilt, china. When any
dish is broken, it can be easily matched and replaced.</p>
<p>A set of china decorated in color to match the color of the dining-room is
exceedingly tasteful. This choice is not an economical one, as it is necessary
to replace broken pieces by having new ones manufactured--an expense quite
equal to the extra trouble required to imitate a dish made in another
country.</p>
<p>By far the most elegant arrangement consists in having different sets of
plates, each set of a different pattern, for every course. Here is an unlimited
field for exquisite taste. Let the meat and <implement>vegetable
dishes</implement> be of plated silver. Let the <implement
rend="italic">&#233;pergne</implement> or centre-peice (holding flowers or
fruit) be of silver, or perhaps it might be preferred of majolica, of bisque,
or of glass. The <implement>majolica ware</implement> is very fashionable now,
and dessert, oyster, and salad sets of it are exceedingly pretty. A set of
majolica plates, imitating pink shells, with a large pink-shell platter, is
very pretty, and appropriate for almost any course. 
<implement>Oyster-plates</implement> in French ware imitate five oyster-shells,
with a miniature cup in the centre for holding the lemon. There are other
patterns of <implement>oyster-plates</implement> in majolica of the most
gorgeous colors, where each rim is concaved in six shells to hold as many
oysters. The harlequin dessert sets are interesting, where every plate is not
only different in design and color, but is a specimen of different kinds of
ware as well. In these sets the Dresden, French, and painted plates of any ware
that suits the fancy are combined.</p>
<p>A set of plates for a course at dinner is unique in the Chinese
<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=32"/> or Japanese patterns. Dessert sets of Bohemian
glass or of cut-glass are a novelty; however, the painted sets seem more
appropriate for the dessert (fruit, etc.), white glass sets are tasteful for
jellies, cold puddings, etc., or what are called the cold 
<emph rend="italic">entrem&#234;ts</emph> served just before the dessert
proper.</p>
<p>But it seems difficult, in entering the Colamores' and other large places of
the kind in New York, to know what to select, there are such myriads of
exquisite plates, table ornaments, and fairy-lands of glass.</p>
<p>I consider the table ornaments in silver much less attractive than those in
fancy ware. There are lovely maidens in bisque, reclining, while they hold
painted oval dishes for a jelly, a Bavarian cream, or for flowers or fruit;
cherub boys in majolica, tugging away with wheelbarrows, which should be loaded
with flowers; antique water-jugs; <implement>cheese-plates</implement> in
Venetian glass; clusters of lilies from mirror bases to hold flowers of 
<emph rend="italic">bonbons;</emph> tripods of dolphins, with great pink
mouths, to hold salt and pepper.</p>
<p>If a lady, with tastes to cultivate in her family, can afford elegancies in
dress, let her retrench in that, and bid farewell to all her ugly and insipid
white china; let wedding presents consist more of these ornaments (which may
serve to decorate any room), and less of silver 
<implement>salt-cellars,</implement> <implement>pepper-stands,</implement> and 
<implement>pickle-forks.</implement></p>
<p>Senator Sumner was a lover of the ceramic art. His table presented a
delightful study to the connoisseur, with its different courses of plates, all
different and 
<emph rend="italic">recherch&#233;</emph> in design. Nothing aroused this
inimitable host at a dinner party from his literacy labors more effectually
than a special announcement to him by Marley of the arrival from Europe of a
new set of quaint and elegant specimens of China ware. He would repair to New
York on the next train.</p>
<p>15th. I will close these suggestions by copying from an English book a
practical drill exercise for serving at table. The dishes are served from the
side-table.</p>
<p>"Let us suppose a table laid for eight persons, dressed in its best; as
attendants, only two persons--a butler and a footman, or one of these, with a

class1="etiquette"><hd align="center">THE DINNER PARTY.</hd>
<p>IT is very essential, in giving a dinner party, to know precisely how many
guests one is to entertain. It is a serious inconvenience to have any doubt on
this subject. Consequently, it is well to send an invitation, which may be in
the following form:</p><illustration><description>An illustration of an
invitation card printed with the following text: Mrs. Smith requests the
pleasure of Mr. Jones's company at dinner, on Thursday, January 5th, at seven
o'clock. R. S. V. P. 12 New York Avenue, January 2d,
1576.</description></illustration>
<p>The capital letters constitute the initials of four French words, meaning,
"Answer, if you please" (<emph rend="italic">R&#233;pondez s'il vous
plait</emph>). The person thus invited must not fail to reply at once,
<pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=34"/> sending a messenger to the door with the note. It
is considered impolite to send it by post.</p>
<p>If the person invited has any doubt about being able to attend the dinner at
the time stated, he should decline the invitation at once. He should be
positive one way or the other, not delaying the question for consideration more
than a day at the utmost. If Mr. Jones should then decline, he might reply as
follows:</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a reply card printed
with the following text: Mr. Jones regrets that he is unable to accept Mrs.
Smith's polite invitation for Thursday evening. 8 Thirty-seventh Street,
January 3d.</description></illustration>
<p>Or,</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a reply card printed
with the following text: Mr. Jones regrets that a previous engagement prevents
his acceptance of Mrs. Smith's polite invitation for Thursday evening.
Thirty-seventh Street, January 3d.</description></illustration>
<p>A prompt and decided answer of this character enables Mrs. Smith to supply
the place with some other person, thereby preventing that most disagreeable
thing, a vacant chair at table.</p>
<p>If the invitation be accepted, Mr. Jones might say in his
note:</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a reply card printed
with the following text: Mr. Jones accepts, with pleasure, Mrs. Smith's
invitation for Thursday evening. Thirty-seventh Street, January
2d.</description></illustration>
<p>The more simple the invitation or reply, the better. Do not attempt any
high-flown or original modes. Originality is most charming on most occasions;
this is not one of them.</p>
<p>In New York, many, I notice, seem to think it elegant to use the French
construction of sentences in formal notes: for instance, they are particular to
say, "the invitation of Mrs. Smith," instead of "Mrs. Smith's invitation;" and
"2d January,"<pb n="29" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=35"/> instead of "January 2d." In writing
in the French language, the French construction of sentences would seem
eminently proper. One might be pardoned for laughing at an English
construction, if ignorance were not the cause. So, when one writes in English,
let the sentences be concise, and according to the rules of the language.</p>
<p>On the appointed day, the guest should endeavor to arrive at the house not
exceeding ten minutes before the time fixed for dinner; and while he avoids a
too early arrival, he should be equally careful about being tardy.</p>
<p>It is enough to disturb the serenity and good temper of the most amiable
hostess during the whole evening for a guest to delay her dinner, impairing it,
of course, to a great extent. She should not be expected to wait over fifteen
minutes for any one. Perhaps it would be as well for her to order dinner ten
minutes after the appointed hour in her invitation, to meet the possible
contingency of delay on the part of some guest.</p>
<p>When the guests are assembled in the drawing-room, if the company be large,
the host or hostess can quietly intimate to the gentleman what ladies they will
respectively accompany to the dining-room. After a few moments of conversation
and introductions, the dinner is to be announced, when the host should offer
his arm to the lady guest of honor, the hostess taking the arm of the gentleman
guest of honor; and now, the host leading the way, all should follow; the
hostess, with her escort, being the last to leave the drawing-room. They should
find their places at table with as little confusion as possible, not sitting
down until the hostess is seated. After dinner is over, the hostess giving the
signal by moving back her chair, all should leave the dining-room. The host may
then invite the gentleman to the smoking-room or library. The ladies should
repair to the drawing-room. A short time thereafter (perhaps in half an hour),
the butler should bring to the drawing-room the tea-service on a 
<implement>salver,</implement> with a <implement>cake-basket</implement> filled
with fancy biscuits, or rather crackers or little cakes.</p>
<p>Placing them on the table, he may then announce to the host that tea is
served. The gentlemen join the ladies; and, after a chat of a few minutes over
the tea, all of the guests may take<pb n="30" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=36"/> their
departure. If the attendant is a waiting-maid, and the tea-service rather
heavy, she might bring two or three cups filled with tea, and a small 
<implement>sugar-bowl</implement> and <implement>cream-pitcher,</implement>also
the <implement>cake-basket,</implement> on a small 
<implement>salver;</implement> and when the cups are passed, return for
more.</p>
<p>I do not like the English fashion, which requires the ladies to retire from
the table, leaving the gentlemen to drink more wine, and smoke. Enough wine is
drunk during dinner. English customs are admirable, generally, and one
naturally inclines to adopt them; but in this instance I do not hesitate to
condemn and reject a custom in which I see no good, but, on the contrary, a
temptation to positive evil. The French reject it; let Americans do the
same.</p></chapter><chapter class1="household"><hd align="center">COOKING AS AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.</hd>
<p>THE reason why cooking in America is, as a rule, so inferior is not because
American women are less able and apt than the women of France, and not because
the American men do not discuss and appreciate the merits of good cooking and
the pleasure of entertaining friends at their own table; it is merely because
American women seem possessed with the idea that it is not the fashion to know
how to cook; that, as an accomplishment, the art of cooking is not as
ornamental as that of needle-work or piano-playing. I do not undervalue these
last accomplishments. A young lady of 
<emph rend="italic">esprit</emph> should understand them; but she should
understand, also, the accomplishment of cooking. A young lady can scarcely have
too many accomplishments, for they serve to adorn her home, and are attractive
and charming, generally. But of them all--painting, music, fancy work, or
foreign language--is there one more fascinating and useful, or one which argues
more intelligence in its acquisition than the accomplishment of cooking?</p>
<p>What would more delight Adolphus than to discover that his pretty 
<emph rend="italic">fianc&#233;e,</emph> Julia, was an accomplished cook;
that with her dainty fingers she could gracefully dash off a creamy omelet, and
by miraculous man&#230;uvres could produce to his astonished
<pb n="31" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=37"/> view a dozen different kaleidoscopic omelets, 
<emph rend="italic">aux fines herbes, aux hu&#238;tres, aux petits pois, aux
tomates,</emph> etc.; and not only that, but scientific croquettes, mysterious
soups, delicious salads, marvelous sauces, and the hundred and one savory
results of a little artistic skill? Delighted Adolphus--if a sensible man, and
such a woman should have no other than a sensible man--would consider this as
the 
<emph rend="italic">chef-d'&#230;uvre</emph> of all her accomplishments, as he
regarded her the charming assurance of so many future comforts.</p>
<p>From innate coquetry alone the French women appreciate the powers of their
dainty table. Cooking is an art they cultivate. Any of the 
<emph rend="italic">haut monde</emph> are proud to originate a new dish, many
famous ones doing them credit in bearing their names.</p>
<p>One thing is quite evident in America--that the want of this ornamental and
useful information is most deplorable. The inefficiency, in this respect, of
Western and Southern women, brought up under the system of slavery, is somewhat
greater than that of the women of the Northern and Eastern States; however, as
a nation, there is little to praise in this regard in any locality. Professor
Blot endeavored to come to the rescue. Every 
<emph rend="italic">man</emph> applauded his enterprise; yet I can myself
testify to the indifference of the women--his classes for the study of cookery
numbering by units where they should have numbered by hundreds. He soon
discontinued his instructive endeavors, and at last died a poor man.</p>
<p>There is little difficulty abroad in obtaining good cooks at reasonable
prices, who have pursued regular courses of instruction in their trade: not so
in America. Hospitality demands the entertaining of friends at the social
board; yet it is almost impossible to do so in this country in an acceptable
manner, unless the hostess herself not only has a proper idea of the serving of
a table, but of the art of cooking the dishes themselves as well. In some of
the larger cities, satisfactory dinners and trained waiters may be provided at
an enormous cost at the famous restaurants, where the meal may appear home-like
and elegant. But unfortunate is the woman, generally, who wants to do "the
correct thing," and, wishing to entertain at<pb n="32"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=38"/>dinner, relies upon the sense, good taste, and management of
the proprietor of a restaurant. She may confidently rely upon one thing--an
extortionate bill; and, generally, as well, upon a vulgar display, which poorly
imitates the manner of refined private establishments.</p>
<p>However, "living for the world" seems very contemptible in comparison with
the importance of that wholesome, satisfactory, every-day living which so
vitally concerns the health and pleasure of the family circle.</p>
<p>But why waste time in asserting these self-evident facts? They are
acknowledged and proclaimed every day by suffering humanity; yet the difficulty
is not remedied. Is there a remedy, then? Yes. This is a free country, yet Dame
Fashion is the Queen. Make it the fashion, then, that the art and science of
cookery shall be classed among the necessary accomplishments of every
well-educated lady. This is a manifest duty on the part of ladies of influence
and position, even if the object be only for the benefit of the country at
large. Let these ladies be accomplished artists in cookery. The rest will soon
follow. There will be plenty of imitators.</p>
<p>Many ladies of rank in England have written valuable books on cookery, and
on the effects resulting from the want of the knowledge. None wrote better than
Lady Morgan. Speaking of clubs, she says:</p>
<p>"The social want of the times, however, brought its remedy along with it,
and the reaction was astounding.... Then it was that clubs arose--homes of
refuge to destitute celibacy, chapels of ease to discontented husbands. There,
men could dine, like gentlemen and Christians, upon all the 
<emph rend="italic">friandises</emph> of the French kitchen, much cheaper and
far more wholesomely than at their own tables upon the tough, half-sodden
fibres of the national roast and boiled, or on the hazardous resources of hash;
gravy soup, and marrow puddings.</p>
<p>"Moral England gave in. The English 'home'--that temple of the heart, that
centre of all the virtues--was left to the solitary enjoyment of the English
wives.</p>
<p>"To your 
<emph rend="italic">casseroles,</emph> then, women of Britain! Would you, with
a falconer's voice, lure your faithless tassels back again?
<pb n="33" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=39"/> Apply to the practical remedy of your wrongs;
proceed to the reform of your domestic government, and turn your thoughts to
that art which, coming into action every day in the year during the longest
life, includes within its circles the whole philosophy of economy and order,
the preservation of good health, and the tone of good society--and all
peculiarly within your province."</p></chapter><chapter class1="generalfood"
class2="etiquette"><hd align="center">BREAKFAST.</hd>
<p>AFTER a fast of twelve or thirteen hours, the system requires something
substantial as preparation for the labors of the day; consequently, I consider
the American breakfasts more desirable for an active people than those of
France or England.</p>
<p>In France, the first breakfast consists merely of a cup of coffee and a
roll. A second breakfast, at eleven o'clock, is more substantial, dishes being
served which may be eaten with a fork (<emph rend="italic">d&#233;jeuner
&#224; la fourchette</emph>), as a chop with a potato 
<emph rend="italic">souffl&#233;.</emph> No wonder there are 
<emph rend="italic">caf&#233;s</emph> in Paris where American breakfasts are
advertised, for it takes one of our nationality a very short time to become
dissatisfied with this meagre first meal.</p>
<p>In England, breakfast is a very informal meal. After some fatiguing
occasion, if one should desire the luxury of an extra nap, he is not
mercilessly expected at the table simply because it is the breakfast-hour; for
there the breakfast-hour is any time one chances to be ready for it. Gentlemen
and ladies read their papers and letters in the breakfast-room--a practice
which, of course, is more agreeable for guests than convenient for servants.
However, if one can afford it, why not? This habit requires a little different
setting of the table. It is decorated with flowers or plants, and upon it are
placed several kinds of breads, fruits, melons, potted meats, and freshest of
boiled eggs. But the substantial dishes must be served from the sideboard,
where they are kept in silver <implement>chafing-dishes</implement> over 
<implement>spirit-lamps.</implement> As members of the family or guests enter,
the servant helps them each once, then leaves the room. If they have further
wants, they help themselves or ring a bell.</p><pb n="34" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=40"/>
<p>The American breakfast is all placed upon the table, unless oatmeal porridge
should be served as a first course. Changes of plates are also necessary when
cakes requiring sirup or when melons or fruits are served.</p>
<p>Let us now set the American breakfast-table.</p>
<p>The <implement>coffee-urn</implement> and silver service necessary are
placed in a straight line before the hostess. The one or two kinds of
substantials are set before the host; vegetables or 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es</emph> are placed on the sides. Do not have
them askew. It is quite as easy for an attendant to place a dish in a straight
line as in an oblique angle with every other dish on the table.</p>
<p>I advocate the general use of oatmeal porridge for breakfast. Nothing is
more wholesome, and nothing more relished after a little use. If not natural,
the taste should be acquired. It is invaluable for children, and of no less
benefit for persons of mature years. Nearly all the little Scotch and Irish
children are brought up on it. When Queen Victoria first visited Scotland, she
noticed the particularly ruddy and healthy appearance of the children, and,
after inquiry about their diet and habits, became at once a great advocate for
the use of porridge. She used it for her own children, and it was at once
introduced very generally into England. Another of its advantages is that
serving it as a first course enables the cook to prepare many dishes, such as
steaks, omelets, etc., just as the family sit down to breakfast; and when the
porridge is eaten, she is ready with the other dishes "smoking hot."</p>
<p>It would be well if more attention were given to breakfasts than is usually
bestowed. The table might have a fresher look with flowers or a flowering plant
in the centre. The breakfast napery is very pretty now, with colored borders to
suit the color of the room, the table-cloth and napkins matching.</p>
<p>The beefsteaks should be varied, for instance, one morning with a tomato
sauce, another 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la ma&#238;tre d'h&#244;tel,</emph> or with a
brown sauce, or garnished with water-cresses, green pease, fried potatoes,
potato-balls, etc., instead of being always the same beefsteak, too frequently
overcooked or undercooked, and often floating in butter.</p>
<p>Melons, oranges, compotes, any and all kinds of fruits, should
<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=41"/> be served at breakfast. In the season, sliced
tomatoes, with a French or 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> dressing, is a most refreshing breakfast
dish. A great resource is in the variety of omelets, and with a little
practice, nothing is so easily made. One morning it may be a plain omelet;
another, with macaroni and cheese; another, with fine herbs; another, with
little strips of ham or with oysters. The English receipt on page 148 makes a
pleasant change for a veal cutlet. When chickens are no longer very young, the
receipt on page 175 (deviled chicken), with a Cunard sauce or a white sauce, is
another change. The different arrangements of meat-balls are croquettes, with
tomato, cream, apple, or brown sauces, are delicious when they are freshly and
carefully made.</p>
<p>As there are hundreds of delicious breakfast dishes, which only require a
little attention and interest to understand, how unfortunate it must be for a
man to have a wife who has nothing for breakfast but an alternation of
juiceless beefsteak, greasy and ragged mutton-chops, and swimming hash, with
unwholesome hot breads to make up deficiencies!</p>
<p>Breakfast parties are very fashionable, being less expensive than dinners,
and just as satisfactory to guests. They are served generally about ten
o'clock, although any time from ten to twelve o'clock may be chosen for the
purpose. It seems to me that ten o'clock, or even nine o'clock (it depends upon
the persons invited), is the preferable hours. Guests might prefer to retain
their strength by a repast at home if the breakfast-hour were at twelve
o'clock, and then the fine breakfast would be less appreciated. At breakfast
parties, with the exception of the silver service being on the table all the
time for tea and coffee, the dishes are served in courses precisely as for
dinner.</p>
<p>In England, breakfast parties are perhaps more in favor than lunch parties,
especially among the 
<emph rend="italic">literati.</emph> Macaulay said, when extolling the merits
of breakfast parties as compared with all other entertainments, "Dinner parties
are mere formalities; but you invite a man to breakfast because you want to
see<emph rend="italic">him.</emph>"</p>
<p>There bills of fare are given for breakfast parties, which will show the

class1="generalfood" class2="etiquette"><hd align="center">LUNCH.</hd>
<p>THIS is more especially a ladies' meal. If one gives a lunch party, ladies
alone are generally invited. It is an informal meal on ordinary occasions, when
every thing is placed upon the table<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=43"/> at once. A
servant remains in the room only long enough to serve the first round of
dishes, then leaves, supposing that confidential conversation may be desired.
Familiar friends often "happen in" to lunch, and are always to be expected.</p>
<p>Some fashionable ladies have the reputation of having every fine
lunches--chops, chickens, oysters, salads, chocolate, and many other good
things being provided; and others, just as fashionable, have nothing but a cup
of tea or chocolate, some thin slices of bread and butter, and cold meat; or,
if of Teutonic taste, nothing but cheese, crackers, and ale, thus reserving the
appetite for dinner.</p>
<p>In entertaining at lunch, the dishes are served in the same manners as for
dinner. Each dish is served as a separate course. It may be placed on the table
before the hostess, if the lunch party is not very large; but it is generally
served from the side. The table is also decorated in the same manner as for
dinner, with a centre-piece of flowers or of fruit, and with various 
<implement rend="italic">compotiers</implement> around the centre, containing
fruits, 
<emph rend="italic">bonbons,</emph> little fancy cakes, Indian or other
preserves, etc. Other ornaments, in Dresden china, <implement>majolica
ware,</implement> Venetian or French glass, etc., filled with flowers, are
often seen. Little dishes of common glass in different shapes, as crosses,
quarter-moons, etc., about an inch high (see cuts, page 58), are also filled
with flowers, and placed at symmetrical distances. As the last-mentioned
decorations are very cheap, every one may indulge in them, and consider that
there are no more beautiful ornaments, after all.</p>
<p>The lunch-table is generally covered with a colored table-cloth.</p>
<p>The principal dishes served are 
<emph rend="italic">pat&#233;s,</emph> croquettes, shell-fish, game,
salads--in fact, all kinds of 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es,</emph> and cold desserts, or I may say
dishes are preferred which do not require carving. 
<emph rend="italic">Bouillon</emph> is generally served as a first course in 
<emph rend="italic">bouillon</emph> cups, which are quite like large
coffee-cups, or coffee or <implement>tea cups</implement> may be used, although
any dinner soup served in <implement>soup-plates</implement> is 
<emph rend="italic">en regle.</emph> A cup of chocolate, with whipped cream on
the top, is often served as an another course.</p>

SUPPERS.</hd>
<p>As ladies have exclusive lunches, gentlemen have exclusive suppers. Nearly
the same dishes are served for suppers as for lunches, although gentlemen

enough; or for chocolate might be substituted sherry or a bowl of punch.</p>
<p>For especial occasions for a company of thirty or forty, a table prettily
set with some flowers, fruit, chicken salad, croquettes or sweet-breads and
pease, one or two or more kinds of ice-cream and cakes, is quite sufficient.
Either coffee and tea, Champagne, a bowl of punch or of eggnog, would be
sufficient in the way of beverage.</p></chapter><chapter class1="household"><hd
align="center">SOMETHING ABOUT ECONOMY.</hd>
<p>I AM indebted to a French girl living in our family for the substance of
this chapter. Her parents being obliged to live in a most economical way in St.
Louis, still had an uncommonly<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=47"/> good table. One
resource was a little garden, in which small compass were raised enough onions,
tomatoes, carrots, and a few other vegetables, to nearly supply the family. A
small bed of four feet square, surrounded by a pretty border of lettuce, was
large enough for raising all necessary herbs, such as sage, summer savory,
thyme, etc. Little boxes in the kitchen windows contained growing parsley, ever
ready for use.</p>
<p>I give receipts for three of their soups--the onion, vegetable 
<emph rend="italic">Pur&#233;e,</emph> and potato soups being most excellent,
and costing not over from five to ten cents each. One of their dinner dishes
was a heart (10 cents) stuffed, baked two or three hours, and served with a
brown gravy and an onion garnish (see receipt). Still another was a two-pound
round-steak (20 cents), spread with a bread and sage stuffing, then rolled,
tied, floured, seasoned on top, then baked, basting it often. It was a pretty
dish, with tomato sauce around it. Sometimes a cheap fish was cut in slices,
egged and bread-crumbed, fried, and garnished with fried potatoes. They had
always a salad for dinner, prepared from their border of lettuce, some cold
potatoes, cold beans, or other vegetable. A fine breakfast dish was of kidneys
(5 cents). Few Americans know how to cook kidneys, and butchers often throw
them away; yet in France they are considered a great delicacy.</p>
<p>Their 
<emph rend="italic">r&#233;pertoire</emph> of cheap dishes was large; so
there was always a change for, at least, each day of the week. A crumb of bread
was never wasted. All odd morsels were dried in the oven, pounded, and put away
in a tin-box, ready for breading cutlets cut from any pieces of mutton or veal,
and for many other purposes.</p>
<p>Any pieces of suet or drippings were clarified and put one side, to be used
for frying. Remains of cooked vegetables of any kind were saved for soups and
sauces. Not a slice of a tomato nor leaf of a cabbage was thrown away.</p>
<p>If they had butter that was not entirely sweet, they added more salt, a
little soda, brought it to a boil on the stove, and then put it away in a
little <implement>crock.</implement> By allowing the settlings to remain at the
bottom, the butter became entirely sweet, and not too salt for cooking
purposes.</p><pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=48"/>
<p>Chickens, cutlets, etc., were larded at this table. Now, just to mention the
word "larding" is to overwhelm a common cook; and to require it, is to rivet in
the minds of most housewives the entire impracticability of a whole receipt in
which it is an item. Pieces of salt pork or breakfast bacon should always be
kept in the house. A pound of it, which is not expensive, may last a long time,
as it requires very little for flavoring many things; then, if one has any idea
of sewing, or what it is to push a needle through any thing, one can lard. It
only requires a <implement>larding-needle,</implement> which costs fifteen
cents, and which should last a century. By placing little cut strips of pork in
the end of the needle, as is explained among "directions," then drawing the
needle through parts of the meat, leaving the pork midway, this wonderfully
difficult operation is accomplished. It is only a few minutes' pastime to lard
turkeys, chickens, birds, cutlets, sweet-breads, etc., which gives to them
flavor and style.</p>
<p>Limited in fortune as were this family, they were never without stock at
hand. Their meat for croquettes, patties, etc., had served a duty to the 
<implement>soup-kettle.</implement> If a chicken was to be boiled for the
table, it was thrown into the <implement>stock-pot</implement> while the soup
was simmering, and thus it and the chicken were both benefited.</p>
<p>Their meat dishes were often garnished with little potato-balls, cooked 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la Parisienne,</emph> or simply boiled. This
seemed extravagant; but as a <implement>French vegetable-cutter</implement>
only costs twenty-five cents, and the balls can be cut very rapidly--all the
parings boiled and mashed serving another time as potato-cakes--there was
nothing wasted, and little time lost.</p>
<p>In short, this household (and it is a sample of nearly all French families
of limited means) lived well on little more than many an American family would
throw away.</p>

<p>FOWLS or joints should be tied or well skewered into shape before
boiling.</p>
<p>Every thing should be 
<emph rend="italic">gently</emph> simmered, rather than fast boiled, in order
to be tender. The water should never be allowed to stop simmering before the
article is quite done. A pudding is thus entirely ruined.</p>
<p>The kettle should be kept covered, merely raising the cover at times to
remove the scum. Boiled fowl, with a white sauce, is a favorite English dish,
and very nice it is if properly prepared.</p></section><section
class1="generalfood"><hd align="center">FRYING.</hd>
<p>Frying means cooking by 
<emph rend="italic">immersion</emph> in hot fat, butter, or oil. There is no
English word for what is called frying in a<pb n="44"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=50"/>spoonful of fat, first on one side, and then on the other. 
<emph rend="italic">Saut&#233;</emph> is the French word, and should be
Anglicized. Ordinary cooks, instead of frying, invariably 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;</emph> every thing. Almost every article that
is usually 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;d</emph> is much better and more economical 
<emph rend="italic">fried;</emph> as, for instance, oysters, fish, birds,
cutlets, crabs, etc.</p>
<p>The fat should always be tested before the article is immersed. A little
piece of bread may be thrown in, and if it colors quickly, the fat is ready,
and not before. The temperature of hot grease, it will be remembered, is much
greater than that of boiling water, which can not exceed a certain degree of
heat, whether it boil slow or fast. Hot grease reaches a very high degree of
heat, and consequently the surface of any thing is almost instantaneously
hardened or crisped when thrown into it. The inside is thus kept free from
grease, and is quickly cooked. An article first dipped in egg and bread-crumbs
should be 
<emph rend="italic">entirely</emph> free from grease when thus cooked, as the
egg is hardened the instant it touches the hot grease, and the oyster,
croquette, cutlet, or sweet-bread is perfectly protected. The same fat can be
used repeatedly for frying the same thing. The fat in which fish is fried
should not be again used for any thing except fish. Professional cooks have
several frying-kettles, in which fat is kept for frying different things. A
little kettle for frying potatoes exclusively should always be at hand.</p>
<p>One will see that this style of cooking is economical, as there is very
little waste of fat; and then fried articles need no other dressing.</p>
<p>After frying fish, meat, or vegetables, let the fat stand about five
minutes; strain, and then return it to the kettle, which should always be kept
covered, after it is once cold.</p>
<p>Beef suet, salted, is quite as good for frying as lard, and is much cheaper.
It is well to purchase it by the pound, and have it rendered in the
kitchen.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p align="center"><purpose>TO PREPARE GREASE FOR

<p>Take <ingredient>beef suet, the part around the kidneys,</ingredient> or any

fire; boil gently for fifteen minutes; skim it well during the process; take
from the fire, leave it five minutes, and then strain it; after which, put it
in pots, and keep them in a dry and cool place; cover the pots well every time
you have occasion to use, but never cover them while the grease is warm. This
grease is as good, if not better than any other to fry fish, fritters, and
other similar things, which require to be entirely covered with grease.<ref

align="center">BROILING.</hd>
<p>I did not appreciate the nicety of boiling until, upon an occasion, a
gentleman invited a dinner company to a private dining-room of one of our large
restaurants, to eat a certain kind of fish, which he considered especially
fine. The host was quite out of humor to see the fish come to the table baked,
when he had ordered it broiled. The proprietor afterward explained that, for
some reason, his French cook was absent for that day, and he had no other who
could broil so large a fish. I at once realized that, after all, it must be a
delicate and difficult thing to broil a large fish, so that the centre would be
well done, and the surface not burned. The smaller and thinner the article, the
hotter should be the fire; the larger the article, the more temperate the fire,
or, rather, the greater distance it should at first be placed from it. The
fish, in this case, should have been wrapped in oiled or buttered paper. It
should have been placed rather near the fire for the first few minutes; then
removed farther away, or placed on another more moderate fire. A large 
<implement>baking-pan</implement> should have covered the top of the fish, to
hold the heat. When nearly done, the paper should have been removed, to allow
the surface to brown.</p><ednote>The following note appears at the bottom of
page 45 in the original text.</ednote>
<p id="n1" size="smaller">*The author would add a small proportion of water to
the pieces of fat. It facilitates the melting process, preserves the color, and
will all evaporate in cooking.</p>
<p>Always grease the <implement>gridiron</implement> well, and have it 
<emph rend="italic">hot,</emph> before the meat is placed on it. Any thing
egged and bread-crumbed should be buttered before it is broiled. Fish should be
buttered and sprinkled with flour, which will prevent the skin from
<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=52"/> adhering to the 
<implement>gridiron.</implement>Cutlets, and in fact every thing, are more
delicate buttered before boiling. A little lemon-juice is also often a nice
addition. Birds, and other things which need to be halved, should be broiled, 
<emph rend="italic">inside</emph> first.</p>
<p>Remember that a hot, clear fire is necessary for cooking all small articles.
They should be turned often, to be cooked evenly, without being burned.</p>
<p>Never put a fork in the lean part of meat on the 
<implement>gridiron,</implement> as it allows the juice to escape.</p>
<p>Always cover the <implement>gridiron</implement> with a tin pan or a 
<implement>baking-pan.</implement> The sooner the meat is cooked without
burning, the better. The pans holds the heat, and often prevents a stray line
of smoke from touching the meat.</p>
<p>If the fire should be too hot, sprinkle salt over it.</p></section><section
class1="generalfood"><hd align="center">ROASTING.</hd>
<p>There is little use to talk about roasting, as but few will attempt it,
always considering it easier to bake instead. Indeed, there is so little demand
in many sections for stoves and ranges suited to the purpose that they are
difficult to obtain. Of course, there is no comparison between these modes of
cooking. Beef, mutton, turkeys, ducks, or birds--in fact, any kind of meat is
tenfold better roasted than baked. In Europe, all these articles are roasted;
and people there would have great contempt for a piece of beef or a turkey
baked. In New York and Philadelphia, also, at the finer establishments, the
meats are generally roasted. The trouble is little greater than to bake. It is
only necessary to have the range or stove constructed for roasting, and a tin
screen, with a spit and <implement>jack,</implement> to place before the coals.
Some of the <implement>roasters</implement> are arranged with a 
<implement>spring-jack.</implement> The meat is placed on the spit, and the
spring wound up, which sets the meat to revolving slowly before the fire.</p>
<p>In roasting, the meat should at first be placed near the coals, so as to
quickly harden the surface; then it should be removed back a little distance,
to be cooked through, without burning. The oftener it is basted, the better it
is. If the roast of meat is very large, it should be surrounded with a buttered
paper.</p>
<p>Just before the meat is done, it should be basted with a little
<pb n="47" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=53"/> butter or drippings, then sprinkled with flour,
and placed nearer the fire, to brown nicely, when it will take a frothy
appearance.</p>
<p>Much depends upon the management of the fire. It should be made some time
before the meat is placed for roasting, so that the coals may be bright and
hot. It should also be strong enough to last, with only the addition of an
occasional coal at the top. In fine establishments abroad, a grate for burning
coal, charcoal, or wood is made in the kitchen, for the purpose of roasting
only. This is convenient, but more expensive than roasting in ranges or stoves,
where the same fire may serve for cooking every thing.</p></section><section
class1="generalfood"><hd align="center">SAUT&#233;ING.</hd>
<p>As I have already said, frying implies immersing in fat or oil; but 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;ing</emph> means to cook in a 
<implement>spider</implement> or <implement><emph
rend="italic">saut&#233;</emph> pan,</implement> with just enough hot fat to
keep the article, while being cooked, from sticking. The fat should always be
quite hot before placing on it any thing to cook.</p></section><section
class1="generalfood"><hd align="center">BRAISING.</hd>
<p>A <implement>braising-kettle</implement> has a deep cover, which holds
coals; consequently, the cooking is done from above as well as below. It is
almost air-tight, thus preventing evaporation, and the article to be cooked
imbibes whatever flavor one may wish to give it.</p>
<p>The article is generally cooked in stock or broth (water may be used also),
with slices of bacon, onion, carrot, etc., placed around the meat. It is a
favorite mode of cooking pigeons. An ordinary cut of beef may be made very
savory cooked in this manner, and the juice left makes a good gravy when freed
from fat.</p>
<p>If a <implement>braising-pan</implement> is not at hand, a common,
tight-covered saucepan answers very well without the upper coals. Except for
coloring larding on the top of the article to be braised, I do not appreciate
the value of the upper coals, anyway; and the coloring may be accomplished with
the <implement>salamander</implement> or hot shovel as
well.</p></section><section class1="meatfishgame"><pb n="48"

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose>Boning</purpose> is not a difficult operation. It only requires
time, a thin, sharp knife, and a little care. Cut off the neck, and also the
legs at the first joint. Cut the skin in a line down the middle of the back.
Now, taking first one side and then the other of the cut in the fingers,
carefully separate the flesh from the bones, sliding the knife close to the
bone. When you come to the wings and legs, it is easier to break or unjoint the
bones at the body-joint; cutting close by the bone, draw it, turning the flesh
of the legs and wings inside out. When all the bones are out, the skin and
flesh can be re-adjusted and stuffed into shape. As the leg and wing bones
require considerable time to remove, they may be left in, and the body stuffed
with <ingredient>lamb or veal force-meat.</ingredient> See receipt for boned

<p>Pounded and sifted cracker-crumbs can be purchased by the pound, at bakeries
and large groceries, for the same price as whole crackers. However, it will
never be necessary to purchase cracker-crumbs, if all scraps of bread are saved
and dried. It is deplorable for a cook to throw them away. It shows that she is
either too indolent to ever learn to cook, or too ignorant of the uses of
scraps of bread to be tolerated. If she saves them for purposes of charity, let
her give fresh bread, which will be more acceptable, and save the scraps, which
are equally useful to her. Yet if the bread-crumbs when pounded and sifted are
not very fine, they are not as good as the cracker-dust.</p></section><section

<p>IT requires experience to make good bread. One must know, first, how long to
let the bread rise, as it takes a longer time in cold than in warm weather;
second, when the oven is just of proper temperature to bake it. Bread should be
put in a rather hot oven. It is nearly light enough to bake when put in; so the
rule for baking bread differs from that of baking cake, which should be put
into a moderate oven at first, to become equally heated through before rising.
As bread requires a brisk heat, it is well to have the loaves small, the
French-bread loaves being well adapted to a hot oven. After the bread is baked,
the loaves should be placed on end (covered) at the back of the table until
they become cool.</p>

<p>In the morning, a new process is in order: First, pour over the

water,</ingredient> in which is dissolved half a spoonful of 
<ingredient>soda;</ingredient> mix in lightly about ten and a half heaping
tea-cupfuls of sifted <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> No more 
<ingredient>flour</ingredient> is added to the bread during its kneading.
Instead, the hands are wet in <ingredient>lukewarm water.</ingredient> Now
knead the dough, giving it about eight or ten strokes; then taking it from the
side next to you, pull it up into a long length, then double it, throwing it
down 
<emph rend="italic">snappishly</emph> and heavily. Wetting the hands again,
give it the same number of strokes, or 
<emph rend="italic">kneads,</emph> pulling the end toward you again, and
throwing it over the part left in the pan. Continue this
<pb n="66" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=72"/> process until large bubbles are formed in the
dough. It will take half an hour or longer. The hands should be wet enough at
first to make the dough rather supple. If dexterously managed, it will not
stick to the hands after a few minutes; and when it is kneaded enough, it will
be very elastic, full of bubbles, and will not stick to the pan. When this time
arrives, put the dough away again in a warm place to rise. This will take one
or two hours.</p>
<p>Now comes another new process. Sprinkle plenty of 
<ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, and take out lightly enough dough
to make one loaf of bread, remembering that the French loaves are not large,
nor or the same shape as the usual home-made ones. With
the<illustration><description>An illustration of an oval-shaped lump of

carefully (to prevent doubling the meshes or grain of the dough) to make it
round in shape. Flour the rolling-pin, press it in the centre, rolling a little
to give the dough the form of cut.</p>
<p>Now give each puffed end a roll toward the centre, lapping well the ends.
Turn the bread entirely over, pulling out the ends a little, to give the loaf a
long form, as in cut.</p><illustration><description>An illustration of a long

on one pan. Sprinkle plenty of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the tops, and
set the pans by the side of the fire to again rise a little. It will take
twenty-five or thirty minutes longer. Then bake.</p>
<p>Kneading bread in the manner just described causes the

it may be pealed off in layers. Kneading with

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TOAST.</purpose>I have remarked
before that not one person in a thousand knows how to make good toast. The
simplest dishes seem to be the ones oftenest spoiled. If the cook sends to the
table a properly made piece of toast, one may judge that she is a 
<emph rend="italic">scientific</emph> cook, and may entertain, at the same
time, exalted hopes of her.</p>
<p>The <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should not be too fresh. It should be
cut<emph rend="italic">thin,</emph> evenly, and in good shape. The crust edges
should be cut off. The pieces shaved off can be dried and put in the
bread-crumb can. The object of toasting <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is to
extract all its moisture--to convert the dough into pure farina of wheat, which
is very digestible. Present each side of the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to
the fire for a few moments to 
<emph rend="italic">warm,</emph> without attempting to toast it; then turn
about the first side at some distance from the fire, so that it may slowly and
evenly receive a 
<emph rend="italic">golden</emph> color all over the surface. Now turn it to
the other side, moving it in the same way, until it is perfectly toasted. The
coals should be clear and hot. Serve it the moment it is done, on a warm plate,
or, what is better, a <implement>toast-rack;</implement> consequently, do not
have a piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> toasted until the one for whom
it is intended is ready to eat it.</p>
<p>"If, as is generally done, a thick slice of <ingredient>bread</ingredient>is
hurriedly exposed to a hot fire, and the exterior of the 
<ingredient>bread</ingredient> is toasted nearly black, the intention of
extracting the moisture is defeated, as the heat will then produce no effect on
the interior of the slice, which remains as moist as ever. Charcoal is a bad
conductor of heat. The overtoasted surface is nothing more or less than a thin
layer of charcoal, which prevents the heat form penetrating through the 
<ingredient>bread.</ingredient> Neither will 
<ingredient>butter</ingredient>pass through the hard surface: it will remain on
it, and if exposed to heat, to melt it in, it will dissolve, and run over it in
the form of rancid oil. 
<emph rend="italic">This</emph> is why buttered toast is so often
unwholesome."</p>

</recipe></chapter><chapter class1="soups"><hd align="center">SOUP.</hd>
<p>THE meat should be fresh, lean (all fat possible being removed), and juicy
to make the best soup. It is put into cold, clear water, which should be heated
only moderately for the first half-hour. The object is to extract the juices of
the meat, and if it be boiled too soon, the surface will become coagulated,
thereby imprisoning the juice within. After the first half-hour
<pb n="79" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=85"/> the pot should be placed at the back of the
stove, allowing the soup to simmer for four or five hours.</p>
<p>Nothing is more disagreeable at table than greasy soup. As all particles of
fat are taken off hot liquor with some difficulty, soup should be made the day
before it is to be used, when the fat will rise to the top and harden. It can
then be easily removed.</p>
<p>When vegetables are used, they should be added only in time to become
thoroughly done: afterward they absorb a portion of the richness of the
soup.</p>
<p>When onions are used, they impart better flavor by being fried or 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;d</emph> in a little hot butter or other
grease, before they are added to the soup. In fact, many professional cooks fry
other vegetables also, such as carrots and turnips. Sometimes they even fry
slightly the chickens, beef, etc., and then cut them into smaller pieces for
boiling. Potatoes and cabbage should be boiled in separate water before they
are added to a soup.</p>
<p>Amateur cooks seem to have a great aversion to making stock. They think it
must be something troublesome, and too scientific to undertake; whereas, in
truth, it saves the trouble of going through the process of soup-boiling every
day, and it is as easy to make as any simple soup. One has only to increase the
quantity of meat and bones to any desired proportion, adding pepper and salt,
and also vegetables, if preferred.</p>
<p>The stock should be kept in a stone jar. It will form a jelly, and in cool
weather will last at least a week.</p>
<p>Just before dinner each day, in order to prepare soup, it is only necessary
to cut off some of the jelly and heat it. It is very good with nothing
additional; but one can have a change of soup each day by adding different
flavorings, such as onion, macaroni, vermicelli, tomato, tapioca, spring
vegetables (which will make a 
<emph rend="italic">julienne</emph>), poached eggs, fried bread, asparagus,
celery, green pease, etc. I will be explicit about these additions in the
receipts. Stock is also valuable for gravies, sauces, and stews, and for
boiling many things, such as pigeons, chickens, etc.</p>

</recipe></chapter><chapter class1="meatfishgame"><hd align="center">FISH.</hd>
<p>IF a fish is not perfectly fresh, perfectly cleaned, and thoroughly cooked,
it is not eatable. It should be cleaned or drawn as soon as it comes from
market, then put on the ice until the time of cooking. It should not be soaked,
for it impairs the flavor, unless it is frozen, when it should be put into
ice-cold water to thaw; or unless it is a salted fish, when it may be soaked
overnight.</p>
<p>The greatest merit of a fish is freshness. The secret of the excellence of
the fish at the Saratoga Lake House, where they have famous trout dinners, is
that, as they are raised on the premises, they go almost immediately from the
pond to the <implement>fish-kettle.</implement> One is to be pitied who has not
tasted fish at the sea-shore, where fishermen come in just before dinner, with
baskets filled with blue-fish, flounders, etc., fresh from the water.</p>
<p>A long, oval <implement>fish-kettle</implement> (page 52) is very convenient
for frying or boiling fish. It has a strainer to fit, in which the fish is
placed, enabling it to be taken from the kettle without breaking. A fish is
sufficiently cooked when the meat separates easily from the bones. When the
fish is quite done, it should be left no longer in the kettle; it will lose its
flavor.</p>
<p>It makes a pleasant change to cook fish "<emph rend="italic">au
gratin.</emph>" It is a simple operation, but little attempted in America. I
would recommend this mode of cooking for eels, or the Western white-fish.</p>
<p>A fish is most delicious fried in olive-oil. A friend told me he purchased
olive-oil by the keg, for cooking purposes. It is, 
<pb n="100" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=106"/> of course, expensive, and lard or beef drippings
answer very well. I would recommend, also, frying fish by 
<emph rend="italic">immersion.</emph></p>
<p>If a fish is to be served whole, do not cut off the head and tail. It also
presents a better appearance to stand the fish on its belly rather than lay it
on it side.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO BROIL FISH.</purpose>The same
rule applies to broiling <ingredient>fish</ingredient> as to every thing else.
If the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is small, it requires a clear, hot fire.
If the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is large, the fire must be moderate;
otherwise the outside of the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> would be burned
before the inside is cooked. Many rub the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> over
with <ingredient>olive-oil;</ingredient> others split a large 
<ingredient>fish;</ingredient> still others broil it whole, and cut notches at
equal distances across its sides. When you wish to turn the 
<ingredient>fish,</ingredient> separate carefully with a knife any part of it
which sticks to the <implement>gridiron;</implement> then, holding a platter
over the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> with one hand, turn the 
<implement>gridiron</implement> over with the other, leaving the 
<ingredient>fish</ingredient> on the platter: it will now be a more easy matter
to turn it without breaking. As soon as the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is
done, sprinkle over <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and spread <ingredient>butter</ingredient> all
over it with a knife. Set it in the oven a moment, so that the 
<ingredient>butter</ingredient> may soak in the 
<ingredient>fish.</ingredient>This is the most common way of seasoning it. It
is almost as easy to first sprinkle <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>salt,</ingredient>then a few drops of 
<ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> over the <ingredient>fish;</ingredient>
then a table-spoonful of <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> chopped fine; then
some <ingredient>melted butter</ingredient> over all. Put it a moment in the
oven to soak. They call this a <ingredient><emph rend="italic">ma&#238;tre-d'

receipts not under the general rule:</p><section class1="meatfishgame"><hd

<p>is undoubtedly best boiled. The only exception to the rule of boiling 
<ingredient>fish</ingredient> is in the case of 
<ingredient>salmon,</ingredient> which must be put in hot instead of cold 
<ingredient>water,</ingredient> to preserver its color. A favorite way of 
<purpose>boiling a whole salmon</purpose> is in the form of a letter S, as in
plate.<illustration><description>A large fish, formed into an S-shape and
served on a round platter.</description></illustration>It is done as follows:
Thread a <implement>trussing-needle</implement> with some twine; tie the end of
the string around the head, fastening it tight; then pass the needle through
the centre part of the body, draw the string tight, and fasten it around the
tail. The <ingredient>fish</ingredient> will assume the desired form.</p>
<p>For parties or evening companies, <ingredient>salmon</ingredient> boiled in
this form (middle cuts are also used), served cold, with a <ingredient><emph

dish. It is then generally mounted in style, on an oval or square block

carved in any form with a sharp knife. It is then fried a light-brown in

<emph rend="italic">croustades</emph> are made of wood, which are covered with 
<ingredient>white pepper,</ingredient> and brushed over with a little half-set

then decorated with squares of <ingredient>aspic jelly.</ingredient> A

align="center">SAUCES.</hd>
<p>THE French say the English only know how to make one kind of sauce, and a
poor one at that. Notwithstanding the French understand the sauce question, it
is very convenient to make the drawn butter, and, by adding different
flavorings, make just so many kinds of sauce. For instance, by adding capers,
shrimps, chopped pickles, anchovy paste, chopped boiled eggs, lobster, oysters,
parsley, cauliflower, etc., one has caper, shrimp, pickle, anchovy, egg, and
the other sauces. The drawn-butter sauce is simple, yet few make it properly,
managing generally<pb n="120" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=126"/> to have it insipid, and with
flour uncooked. If a housekeeper has any pride about having a good table, she
will be amply repaid for learning some of the French sauces, which are, at
last, simple enough. We are often frightened to see many items in a receipt; we
shake our heads dubiously at the trouble and extravagance of one receipt
mentioning thyme, nutmeg, bay-leaf, mace, shallot, capers, pepper-corns,
parsley, and last of all the horrors, stock. As far as the herbs are concerned,
an investment of twenty-five cents will purchase enough mace, thyme,
bay-leaves, and pepper-corns for a year's supply of abundant sauces, to say
nothing of their uses for braising, 
<emph rend="italic">blanquettes,</emph> etc. Five cents' worth of shallots
should last a long time; they are sold in all city markets, being only young
forced onions. Capers would be extravagant if a bottleful, costing sixty cents,
would not last a year in a small-sized family. I have already said enough about
stock to show that one must be very incompetent if a little of it can not be at
hand, made of trimmings and cheap pieces of meat and bones.</p>
<p>The use of mushrooms and truffles, which are comparatively cheap in France,
can not be extensively introduced here. A little tin can, holding about a gill
of tasteless truffles, costs three or four dollars; however, mushrooms are much
less expensive, and infinitely better. A can of mushrooms costs forty cents,
and is sufficient for several sauces and 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es.</emph></p>
<p>Some persons raise mushrooms in their cellars. A small, rich bed in a dark
place where the soil will not freeze, planted with mushroom spawn, will yield
enough mushrooms for the family, and the neighbors besides, with very little
trouble and expense.</p>
<p>The French white sauces differ from the English white sauce, as they are
made with strong white stock, prepared with veal, or chickens, or both, and
some vegetables for a basis. If one would learn to make the 
<emph rend="italic">sauce Bechamel,</emph> it will be found an easy affair to
prepare many delicious 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es,</emph> such as chicken in shells (<emph
rend="italic">en coquille</emph>), or in papers (<emph rend="italic">en
papillote</emph>), and mushrooms in crust (<emph rend="italic">cro&#251;te aux
champignons</emph>).</p>
<p>For boiled fish the 
<emph rend="italic">sauce Hollandaise</emph> is a decided success. In Paris
every one speaks of the delicious sauce, and bribes
<pb n="121" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=127"/> the 
<emph rend="italic">chef de cuisine</emph> for the receipt. It is made without
stock, and is very simple.</p>
<p>For fried fish the perfection of accompaniments is the 
<emph rend="italic">sauce Tartare</emph>--a mere addition of some capers,
shallots, parsley, and pickles to the 
<emph rend="italic">sauce Mayonnaise.</emph></p>
<p>When tomatoes are so abundant, it is unpardonable that one should never
serve a tomato sauce with a beefsteak, and a score of other meat dishes.</p>
<p>For a chicken or a lobster salad, learn unquestionably the 
<emph rend="italic">sauce Mayonnaise.</emph></p>
<p>In the thickening of sauces, let it be remembered that butter and flour
should be well cooked together before the sauce is added, to prevent the flour
from tasting uncooked. In butter sauces, however, only enough butter should be
used to cook the flour, the remainder added, cut in pieces, after the sauce is
taken from the fire. This preserves it flavor.</p>

<p>FOR a roast of beef, the sirloin and tenderloin cuts are considered the
best. They are more expensive, and are no better than the best cuts of a rib
roast: the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs are the choicest cuts. The latter
roasts are served to better advantage by requesting the butcher to remove the
bones and roll the meat. Always have him send the bones also, as they are
valuable acquisition to the <implement>soup-pot.</implement> As the rolled ribs
roasts are shaved evenly off and across the top when carved (the roasts are to
be cooked rare, of course), they present an equally good appearance for a
second cooking. I have really served a roast a third time to good advantage,
serving it the last time 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la jardini&#232;re.</emph> Of course, in summer
large cuts should not be purchased.</p>
<p>If the animal is young and large, and the meat is of clear, bright-red
color, and the fat white, the meat is sure to be tender and juicy.</p>
<p>There is no better sauce for a good, juicy roast of beef than the simple
juice of the meat. Horse-radish sauce may be served if the beef is not
particularly good.</p>
<p>If a sauce is made by adding hot water, flour, pepper, and salt to the
contents of the <implement>baking-pan</implement> after the beef is cooked, do
not serve it with a half-inch depth of pure grease on top in the 
<implement>sauce-boat.</implement> This is as absurd, when it can be allowed to
stand a moment and simply 
<emph rend="italic">poured off,</emph> or taken off with a spoon, as to serve
wet salt at table, which can easily be placed in the oven a few moments to dry,
before sifting. Also, this kind of <implement>baking-pan</implement> sauce
would not be so very objectionable, if cooks generally knew that it does not
require a scientific education, nor a herculean effort, to strain it through a

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FILLET OF BEEF.</purpose>I will
be very specific about the <ingredient>fillet of beef,</ingredient> as it is
easily managed at home, and is very expensive ordered from the 
<emph rend="italic">restaurateur.</emph> His price is generally ten dollars for
a dressed and cooked <ingredient>fillet of beef</ingredient> for a dinner for
ten or twelve persons. To buy it from the butcher costs a dollar a pound when
dressed; three pounds are quite sufficient for ten or twelve persons. To lard
it (an affair of ten minutes) would cost ten cents more; a box of 
<ingredient>French canned mushrooms,</ingredient> an additional forty cents; a
little <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> five cents.</p>
<p>One sees a <ingredient>fillet of beef</ingredient> at almost every dinner
party. "That same fillet, with mushrooms," a frequent diner-out will say. I
hope to see it continued, for among the substantials there is nothing more
satisfactory.</p>
<p>A good butcherw ill always deliver a <ingredient>fillet of
beef</ingredient>already dressed; if, however, it is necessary to have it
dressed at home, the 
<emph rend="italic">modus operandi</emph> is as follows:</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO TRIM A FILLET OF
BEEF.</purpose>The fillet is the under side of the <ingredient>loin of
beef.</ingredient> The <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> cut from this part are
called <ingredient>porter-house-steaks.</ingredient> This under side, or
fillet, is covered with skin and fat. "All the skin and fat must be removed
from the top of the fillet, from one end to the<pb n="134"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=140"/>other; then the rib-bones are disengaged. The fat adhering to
the side opposite the ribs is only partially removed. Now the sinewy skin
covering the upper <ingredient>meat</ingredient> of the fillet must be removed
in strips, proceeding by slipping the blade of the knife between the skin and
the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> This operation is very simple; yet it
requires great precision. The upper part of a trimmed fillet must be smooth, 
<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> must not be furrowed by hollows occasioned by
wrong movements of the knife. The skin being removed, both extremities of the
fillet are rounded. The fat inside the rib is the only portion of fat allowed
to adhere to the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> The larding of the 
<ingredient>meat</ingredient> is applied to its upper surface."</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO COOK A FILLET OF
BEEF.</purpose>After it is trimmed and larded, put it into a small 
<implement>baking-pan,</implement> in the bottom of which are some chopped
pieces of <ingredient>pork</ingredient> and

and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient>over it, and put a large ladleful of hot 
<ingredient>stock</ingredient> into the bottom of the pan, or it may be simply
basted with <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> Half an hour (if the oven
is very hot, as it should be) before dinner, put it into the oven. Baste it
often, supplying a little hot <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> if necessary.</p>
<p>French cooks often braise a <ingredient>fillet of beef.</ingredient> I do
not like it as well as baking or roasting, as the

<p>THE best pieces of veal are the loin and the fillet. A variety of dishes can
be made with veal cutlets and their different accompaniments. Veal is always
better cooked with pork or ham. Professional cooks generally trim and lard
their veal cutlets, serving them with tomato sauce, pease, beans, breakfast
bacon, lemon-slices, cucumbers, etc. For a cheap dish, one of the most
satisfactory is a knuckle of veal made into a ragout, or pot-pie. Any of the
inferior cuts may be made into a 
<emph rend="italic">blanquette.</emph></p>
<p>A 
<emph rend="italic">fricandeau</emph> of veal is perhaps considered the most
distinguished veal dish. I would always advise the trimming of veal cutlets. It
gives little trouble, but the appearance is much improved, and the trimmings
should be thrown into the <implement>stock-pot.</implement> Veal should always
be thoroughly cooked.</p>

something in the air of England quite different from that of America in
reference to the hanging of meats and game; there, it is to be confessed, the
mutton, after having hung a certain length of time, certainly is more
delicious; here it would be unwholesome, simply not fit to eat. These joints of

<p>IF care is taken in picking and dressing fowls or birds, there is no need of
washing them. In France it is never done, unless there is absolutely something
to wash off; then it is done as delicately as possible. In expostulating once
with an old negro auntie for soaking all the blood and flavor out of a fowl,
she quickly replied, "Bless my soul, child! haven't I cooked chickens for fifty
years?"</p>
<p>When you buy a goose or a duck, be sure that it is young. Never buy an old
duck. The first I ever bought were from a penful at market. I thought myself
very clever in choosing the largest, all being price; not so clever at dinner,
when my husband tried to carve those tough and aged drakes.</p>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">ROAST TURKEY.</purpose>The
secret in having a good roast <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is to baste it
often, and to cook it long enough. A small <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> of
seven or eight pounds (the best selection if fat) should be roasted or baked
three hours at least. A very large <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> should not
be cooked a minute less than four hours; an extra hour is preferable to a
minute less. If properly basted, they will not become dry.</p>
<p>With much experience in hotel life, where 
<ingredient>turkeys</ingredient>are ruined by the wholesale, I have never seen
a piece of <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> that was fit to eat. Besides being
tasteless, they are almost invariably undercooked. First, then, after the 
<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is dressed, season it well, sprinkling 
<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the
inside; stuff it, and tie it well in shape; either lard the top or lay slices
of <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> over it; wet the skin, and sprinkle it well
with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>flour.</ingredient> It is well to allow a 
<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> to remain some time stuffed before cooking.
Pour a little <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> into the bottom of the 
<implement>dripping-pan.</implement> If it is to be roasted, do not put it too
near the coals at first, until it gets well heated through; then gradually draw
it nearer. The excellence of the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> depends much
upon the frequency of basting it; occasionally baste it with a little 
<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> oftener with its own 
<ingredient>drippings.</ingredient> Just before taking it from the fire or out
of the oven, put on more <ingredient>melted butter,</ingredient> and sprinkle
over more <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> this will make the skin more crisp
<pb n="167" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=173"/> and brown. While the 
<ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is cooking, boil the 
<ingredient>giblets</ingredient> well; chop them fine, and mash the 
<ingredient>liver.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is
done, put it on a hot platter. Put the <implement>baking-pan</implement> on the
fire, dredge in a little <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> and when cooked stir
in a little <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> or

excellence of <ingredient>spring chickens</ingredient> depends as much on
feeding as on cooking them. If there are conveniences for building a coop, say
five feet square, on the ground, where some spring 
<ingredient>chickens</ingredient> can be kept for a few weeks, feeding them
with the scraps from the kitchen, and grain, they will be found plump, the meat
white, and the flavor quite different from the thin, poorly fed 
<ingredient>chickens</ingredient> just from market.</p>
<p>The Southern negro cooks have certainly the best way of cooking spring 
<ingredient>chickens,</ingredient> and the manner is very simple. Cut them into
pieces, dip each piece hastily in <ingredient>water,</ingredient> then sprinkle
it with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and
roll it in plenty of <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Have some 
<ingredient>lard</ingredient> in a <implement><emph

rather 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;,</emph> the 
<ingredient>chickens,</ingredient>covering them well, and watching that they
may not burn. When done, arrange them on a hot dish; pour out the 
<ingredient>lard</ingredient> from the <implement>spider,</implement> if there
is more than a tea-spoonful; throw in a cupful or more of 
<ingredient>milk,</ingredient> or, better, <ingredient>cream</ingredient>
thickened with a little <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> stir it constantly,
seasoning it with <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and

<p>IN England, potting is an every-day affair for the cook. If there be ham,
game, tongue, beef, or fish on the table one day, you are quite sure to see it
potted on the next day at lunch or breakfast. It is a very good way of managing
left-over food, instead of invariably making it into hashes, stews, etc. These
potted meats will keep a long time. They are not good unless thoroughly
pounded, reduced to the smoothest possible paste, and free from any unbroken
fibre.</p>

<p>Nothing is more simple than to make an omelet, yet very few can make one.
The eggs stick to the pan, or they are overdone, and tough.</p>
<p>Senator Riddle, of Delaware, a decided epicure, took much pleasure in his
superior knowledge on this important subject. Once when breakfasting with Mrs.
Crittenden, of Kentucky, a piece of omelet of doubtful appearance was presented
to him. "Before we proceed with our breakfast," said he, "let me teach you a
valuable accomplishment." They repaired at once to the kitchen range, where the
senator demonstrated at once his qualifications as a first-class cook. My own
first lesson was from Mr. Riddle, so of course I have the correct 
<emph rend="italic">modus operandi;</emph> afterward in London, however, I
heard a lecture upon omelets from a cooking professor, and was astonished at
the multiplicity of dishes which could be made from this simple preparation;
not only breakfast dishes, but also the variety of sweet omelet for
dessert.</p>

give them twelve vigorous beats with a spoon. This is enough to break all the 
<ingredient>yolks,</ingredient> and twelve beats was Mr. Riddle's rule. Now put
<ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of an egg (for five 
<ingredient>eggs</ingredient>) in the heated pan; turn it around so that it

that all the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> may be equally cooked, or whitened
to a soft, creamy substance. Now, still with the left hand, shake the pan
forward and backward, which will disengage the 
<ingredient>eggs</ingredient>from the bottom; then shaking again the omelet a
little one side, turn with a spoon half of one side over the other; and
allowing it to remain it all the time, toss it over the other; and allowing it
to remain a moment to harden a little at the bottom, gently shaking it all the
time, toss it over on to a warm platter held in the right hand. A little
practice makes one quite dexterous in placing the omelet in the centre of the
platter, and turning it over as it is tossed from the 
<implement>omelet-pan.</implement></p>
<p>However, if one is unsuccessful in the tossing operation, which is the
correct thing, according to the cooking professor, the omelet can be lifted to
the platter with a <implement>pancake-turner.</implement> It should be creamy
and light in the centre, and more firm on the outside.</p>

<p>In an English book is told a story of a famous French salad-dresser who
began very poor, and made a fortune by dressing salad for dinners in London. He
would go from one place to another in his carriage, with a liveried servant,
and his mahogony case. This case contained all the necessaries for his
business, such as differently perfumed vinegars, oils with or without the taste
of fruit, soy, caviar, truffles, anchovies, catchup, gravy, some yolks of eggs,
etc. I confess to lively curiosity as to how these perfumed and scientific
mixtures would taste; however, we will be satisfied with the hundred and one
ways of arranging our simple and delicious salads, within the comprehension of
all.</p>
<p>A French man thinks he can not eat his dinner without his salad. It would be
well if every one had the same appreciation of this most wholesome, refreshing,
and at the same time most economical dish. It is an accomplishment to know how
to dress a salad well, which is especially prized by the fashionable world. The
materials used for salads are generally those shown in the list on the
following page:</p><pb n="220" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=226"/><list align="indent1"

align="indent1"
size="smaller"><item>Chickens,</item><item>Lobster,</item><item>Salmon,</item><item>Prawns,</item><item>Shrimps,</item><item>Sardines.</item></list>
<p>There are two kinds of dressing which are the best and oftenest used: the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> and the French dressing. Epicures prefer
the simple French dressing for salads served without fish or fowl. For chicken
and fish salads, and some vegetables, as tomatoes and cauliflowers, they use
the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> sauce. This arrangement of dressing is
almost universal in London and Paris. In America we use the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> for all salads. I prefer the foreign
custom. The simple salad with the French dressing is, after all, the most
refreshing and satisfactory, if one has a heavy dinner served before it. The
receipts are as follows:</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">MAYONNAISE SAUCE.</purpose>Put
the uncooked <ingredient>yolk of an egg</ingredient> into a cold bowl; beat it
well with a silver fork; then add two salt-spoonfuls of 
<ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and one salt-spoonful of <ingredient>mustard
powder;</ingredient> work them well a minute before adding the 
<ingredient>oil;</ingredient> then mix in a little good 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> which must be poured in very slowly (a few drops
at a time) at first, alternated occasionally with a few drops in 
<ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient> In proportion as the 
<ingredient>oil</ingredient> is used, the sauce should gain consistency. When
it begins to have the appearance of jelly, alternate a few drops of 
<ingredient>lemon-juice</ingredient> with the <ingredient>oil.</ingredient>When
the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> has absorbed a gill of 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> finish the sauce by adding a very little pinch of
<pb n="221" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=227"/> <ingredient>Cayenne pepper</ingredient> and one
and a half tea-spoonfuls of good <ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> taste it to
see that there are <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> 
<ingredient>mustard,</ingredient> <ingredient>cayenne,</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> enough. If not, add more very carefully. These
proportions will suit most tastes; yet some like more 
<ingredient>mustard</ingredient> and more <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> Be
cautious not to use too much <ingredient>cayenne.</ingredient></p>
<p>By beating the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> a minute before adding the 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> there is little danger of the sauce curdling; yet
if, by adding too much <ingredient>oil</ingredient> at first, it should
possibly curdle, immediately interrupt the operation. Put the <ingredient>yolks
of one or two eggs</ingredient> on another plate; beat them well, and add the
curdled 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> by degrees, and finish by adding more 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> 
<ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>cayenne</ingredient> according to taste. If 
<ingredient>lemons</ingredient> are not at hand, many use 
<ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> instead.</p>
<p><attribution>Delmonico</attribution> uses four <ingredient>yolks of
eggs</ingredient> for two quart-bottles of <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> It is
only necessity, then, to use one <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> for a pint of 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> only being a
foundation for the sauce. It is easier, however, to begin with more 
<ingredient>yolks:</ingredient> many use three of them for a gill of 
<ingredient>oil.</ingredient> The <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> will not
curdle so easily if the few drops of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> are used
at first, after a very little <ingredient>oil</ingredient> is used. It keeps
perfectly well by putting it into a <implement>glass preserve or pickle
bottle,</implement> with a ground-glass stopper. It is well to have enough made
to last a week at least. The opportunity of making it may be taken, and adding
it to the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> bottle, when there are extra 
<ingredient>yolks</ingredient> left, after the whites of the eggs are used for
other purposes, such as white cake, 
<ingredient>corn-starch</ingredient>pudding, etc.</p>
<p>It requires about a quarter of an hour to make this sauce. In summer, the
process of making it is greatly facilitated by placing the 
<ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and <ingredient>oil</ingredient> in the 
<implement>ice-chest</implement> half an hour before using them. Sometimes, for
the sake of a change, the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> sauce is made green. It is then

<emph rend="italic">i.e.,</emph> <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in which

<p>Pour the <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> mixed with the 
<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> over the
salad; mix them together; then add the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and mix
again. <attribution>Chaptal</attribution> says: "It results, from this process,
that there can never be too much <ingredient>vinegar:</ingredient> from the
specific gravity of the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> compared with the 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient> what is more than needful will fall to the bottom
of the salad-bowl. The <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should not be dissolved in
the <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> but in the 
<ingredient>oil,</ingredient>by which means it is more equally distributed
through the salad."</p>
<p>This is the usual mode of mixing the salad; but I prefer to mix the 
<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> then add the
<ingredient>oil</ingredient> and <ingredient>onion,</ingredient> and then the 
<ingredient>vinegar;</ingredient> and, when well mingled, to pour the mixture
over the salad, or place the salad over it, and mix all together. It seems to
me to be more evenly distributed in this manner.</p>
<p>Many different combinations can be made to suit the fancy, from the list of
salad materials. I will give certain combinations oftenest seen. It must be
remembered that salad is never good unless perfectly fresh. It should not be
mixed, or brought into the dining-room, until the moment when it is to be
eaten.</p>

in England and France,<pb n="223" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=229"/> called 
<ingredient rend="italic">romaine,</ingredient> is now much used in New York;
it is very crisp and tender. The seeds of this 
<ingredient>lettuce</ingredient>can be obtained in New York. In the East, 
<ingredient>tarragon,</ingredient>and <ingredient>endive</ingredient> also, are
largely produced, and used to imitate these foreign salads. The 
<ingredient>tarragon leaves</ingredient> are chopped fine, and mixed in the 
<ingredient>French dressing (without onion)</ingredient> to use with 
<ingredient>lettuce.</ingredient> The taste for
<ingredient>tarragon</ingredient> is generally an acquired one: I prefer the

<p>PROFESSIONAL cooks use butter for pastry. Puff paste should never be
attempted with lard or a half mixture of it. If lard or clarified beef suet is
used, the pastry of an indifferent cook will be improved by adding a little
baking-powder to the flour and rolling the paste very thin.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to make puff paste. In winter, when it is freezing
outdoors, or in summer, when a refrigerator with ice in it is at hand, it is
very little more trouble to make puff paste than any other kind. The simple
rolling of the dough to form layers requires very little practice. The only
secret left, after using cold water and butter cold enough not to penetrate the
dough, is to have it almost at a freezing-point, or a least thoroughly chilled,
as it is put into a hot oven.</p>
<p>The 
<emph rend="italic">vols-au-vent</emph> of strawberries, or berries of any
kind, or of jellies, or of lemon paste (see age 244), and also 
<emph rend="italic">rissoles,</emph> are especially fine, and are quickly
made.</p>
<p>As hundreds of different dishes can be made with pastry, and as Car&#234;me
has devoted a good-sized volume to the subject, I will copy his receipt for
puff paste. It is not modest, perhaps, to put my own first; but it is for the
benefit of more ordinary cooks, who will never take extra trouble to make a
thing perfect.</p><pb n="233" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=239"/>

and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> are wiped out, and it is quite supple; care
must be taken, however, to keep the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> from
getting too soft, as in this condition it would ruin the paste. Divide it into
three equal parts; spread one part as flatly and evenly as possible over half
of the crust, turn the other half over it, folding it a second time from right
to left. Roll this out to the same rectangular form as before; spread the
second portion of the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on half of the crust;
fold and roll it out again as before, repeating the same process with the third
portion of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> The paste has now been given what
they call three turns; it should be given six turns, turning and rolling the
paste after the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is in. However, after the first
three turns, or after the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is all in, the paste
should be placed on the <ingredient>ice,</ingredient> or in a cold place, to
remain about ten or fifteen minutes between each of the last three turns: this
will prevent the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> getting soft enough to
penetrate the dough. Each time before the dough is folded, it should be turned
half round, so as to roll it in a different direction each time; this makes the
layers<pb n="234" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=240"/> more even. In order to turn the paste, the
end may be held to the rolling-pin; then, rolling the pin, the dough will fold
loosely around it; the board may be sprinkled with 
<ingredient>flour;</ingredient> then the dough can be unrolled in the side
direction. This is better than to turn it with the hands, as it should be
handled as little as possible. When folded the last time, put the paste on a
platter, cover, and place in on the ice for half an hour, or where it may
become thoroughly chilled; then roll it out for immediate use; or, so long as
it is kept in a half-frozen state, it may be kept for one or two days. Firm,
solid <ingredient>butter</ingredient> should be selected for puff paste; a
light, crumbling <ingredient>butter</ingredient> would be very unsuitable.
After the pies, patties, or other articles are made (as in receipts), the
scraps may be used for making

<recipe class1="breadsweets">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">CAR&#234;ME'S RECEIPT FOR PUFF
PASTE.</purpose>Ingredients: Twelve ounces of fine sifted 
<ingredient>flour,</ingredient> twelve ounces of 
<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> two drams of <ingredient>fine
salt,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>yolks of two
eggs</ingredient>beaten.</p>
<p>Manner of working: Having placed twelve ounces of 
<ingredient>flour</ingredient> on the board, make a small hole in the middle,
into which put two drams of <ingredient>fine salt,</ingredient> the 
<ingredient>yolks of two eggs,</ingredient> and nearly a glass of 
<ingredient>water.</ingredient> With the ends of the fingers gradually mix the 
<ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the ingredients, adding a little 
<ingredient>water</ingredient> when necessary, till the paste is of a proper
consistence--rather firm than otherwise. Then lean your hand on the board, and
work it for some minutes, when the paste will become soft to the touch and
glossy in appearance.</p>
<p>Care must be taken, in mixing the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> with the
liquid ingredients, that they do not escape, and that the paste be very lightly
gathered together, to prevent it from forming into lumps, which render it
stiff, and very difficult to be worked, thereby in some degree causing a
failure, which is easily ascertained by the paste, when drawn out, immediately
receding, which arises from its having been clumsily and irregularly mixed. To
remedy this, let it be carefully rolled out, placing here and there five or six
pieces of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> each the size of a
<pb n="235" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=241"/> nutmeg, when, after working it as before, it
will acquire the degree of softness necessary. It is of importance to observe
that this paste should be neither too soft nor too hard, but of a proper
medium; yet it is better to be a little too soft than too stiff. One should not
choose a hot place in which to make paste: for this reason, summer renders the
operation quite difficult. If one can not find a cool place, the paste might be
slightly stiffer in summer than in winter.</p>
<p>When the paste has been made as above, take three-quarters of a pound of 
<ingredient>butter</ingredient> in pieces, which has been twenty minutes in 
<ingredient>ice-water,</ingredient> well washed and pounded. Squeeze and work
it well in a napkin, in order to separate the 
<ingredient>water</ingredient>from it, and at the same time to render it soft,
and, above all, of an equal consistence; then, as quickly as possible, roll the
paste into a square on a marble slab (the ends must be perfectly even, as much
success depends upon folding); place the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the
middle; spread it over half the paste, immediately turning over the other half
of the paste to cover it. Then roll the paste out about three feet in length;
fold it into three parts by doubling one part over the other; after which roll
it out again, and fold it once more into three equal parts; now roll it to a
greater length, fold it, and put it quickly on a plate sprinkled with 
<ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Place this upon ten pounds of 
<ingredient>pounded ice,</ingredient> then, covering it with a second plate,
put upon that one pound of broken ice. This plate serves to keep the surface of
the paste cool, and also to prevent its becoming soft by the action of the air.
After two or three minutes, remove the plate, and turn the paste upside down,
instantly covering it as before. After about fifteen minutes, roll it out, and
use it as expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p>Thus, in less than half an hour, it is possible to make very fine 
<ingredient>puff paste,</ingredient> having previously every thing ready--the
ice pounded, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> frozen, and the oven quite
hot; for otherwise it can not be done. This is all-important, as it is
sometimes an hour before the oven can be made hot. When the oven is half
heated, begin to make the paste.</p>
<p>The great variety of elegant and delicate forms<ref target="n6">*</ref> this
paste is<pb n="236" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=242"/> made to assume justifies one for giving
such explicit instructions, and repays one for all necessary pains to make
it.</p>

friend spoke to me so often about a wonderfully delicious pie that a lady
friend in the country made, that it is not surprising that a person of my
culinary tastes should have been very curious. "I will send for the receipt,"
said I. "But that will not benefit you," he replied, "for I have given the
receipt to several of my friends, and they never succeed. Instead of the light
production three or four inches high of my country friend, the others are
heavy, waxy affairs, very different." I actually took a little journey to see
the lady, to get any side explanations from her own lips. I was repaid, as you
will see by trying the pie.</p>
<p>Ingredients: For two pies, five <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> three
quarters of a cupful of <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> one cupful of 
<ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and necessary flavoring.</p>
<p>Beat the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> and

<ingredient>butter</ingredient> until it is a creamy froth also. Now quickly
add them together, flavoring with a little <ingredient>extract of

return to the oven, to receive a delicate coloring.</p>
<p>The lady says the secret of the pies not becoming heavy is in cutting them,

that if they are allowed to cool without cutting them, they will fall. This is
rather strange; nevertheless, it seems to be true.</p>

align="center">CANNING.</hd>
<p>THIS is a most valuable manner of preserving vegetables and fruits. In
cities where vegetables, fruits, or berries are bought at high prices, and
perhaps not entirely fresh at that, my experience has taught me that it is
cheaper to buy the canned fruits than to have them put up in the house. In the
country the expense is very little as the cans may be purchased in quantities
very cheap; and, with proper care in cleaning and drying them, they can be used
several times.</p><pb n="245" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=251"/>
<p>The manner of canning one kind of fruit or vegetable applies to almost all
kinds, except corn. I would not advise any one to attempt canning corn without
the correct process direct from Mr. Winslow himself. By mixing corn and
tomatoes together no difficulty will be found. Gumbo and tomato mixed are
valuable for soup. Canned tomatoes are invaluable in a household. They are very
easily managed, and are as desirable for soups and sauces as for a separate 
<implement>vegetable dish.</implement> If fruits or vegetables or any kind are
quite fresh, and there is not too large a quantity scalded at one time to
prevent careful management of each can, not one can in a hundred will be lost.
I also advise the 
<emph rend="italic">canning</emph> of sweetmeats of every kind. In that case
the same amount of sugar is not required, and the fruit does not have to be
boiled until the natural flavor is entirely lost. If glass jars are used
instead of cans, they must be put on the fire in cold water with a plate or
piece of wood in the bottom of the kettle. They should not be filled until the
water is boiling, and then they will not be broken. They should be sealed as
soon as possible after they are filled, and when they are cold the covers
should again be tightened, as the glass will contract a little after
cooling.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO CAN TOMATOES.</purpose>Let
them be entirely fresh. Put scalding <ingredient>water</ingredient> over them
to aid in removing the skins. When the cans with their covers are in readiness
upon the table, the red sealing wax (which is generally too brittle, and
requires a little lard melted with it) is in a cup at the back of the fire, the
tea-kettle is full of <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and the 
<ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> are all skinned, we are ready to begin the
canning. First put four cans (if there are two persons, three if only one

closely<pb n="246" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=252"/> with a knife, pour carefully around it
the hot sealing-wax from the tin cup, so bent at the edge that the wax may run
out in a small stream. Hold the knife still a moment longer, that the wax may
set. When these cans are sealed, continue the operation until all the 
<ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> are canned. Now put the blade of an old knife
in the coals, and when it is red-hot run it over the tops of the sealing-wax to
melt any bubbles that may have formed; then, examining each can, notice if
there is any hissing noise, which will indicate a want of tightness in the can,
which allows the steam to escape. If any holes are found, wipe them, and cover
them while the cans are hot with a bit of the sealing-wax. There will be juice

<pb n="248" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=254"/><hd align="center">PRESERVES.</hd>
<p>To make clear, good preserves requires: 1st. No economy of trouble; 2d. That
the fruit be perfectly fresh, 
<emph rend="italic">alive</emph> from the tree or bush, or, as a friend says,
"tasting of the sun."</p>
<p>The French make the clearest, best preserves, because they spare no pains.
They first prepare their sirup or clarified sugar; then, after neatly and
carefully paring or dressing their fruit, cook a few pieces at a time, or only
as many as they can oversee, carefully lifting each piece out of the sirup the
moment it is done. How they preserve strawberries in bottle (each little bottle
of which sells for seventy-five cents), retaining the full flavor and almost
the firmness of the fresh strawberries, is something for me to investigate.</p>
<p>I consider the peach marmalade the most valuable preserve, as it is useful
in preparing desserts. It is a good sauce for almost any kind of pudding,
especially corn-starch and rice puddings. Preserves are generally made too
sweet. Before hermetically sealed cans or jars were in general use, it required
a large quantity of sugar to keep the preserves from fermenting. Now, in using
cans, one can suit the taste as to the sweetness of the preserve. I prefer tin
cans to glass bottles, as sometimes the bottled jelly or preserves will
ferment, requiring a second cooking. Tin cans have never failed me. Others
prefer bottles, having no trouble, they say, in tightening them perfectly. The
citron preserve, flavored with root ginger and lemon, is a success. It has the
flavor of the ginger preserve from the West Indies, which is so fashionable,
expensive, and serviceable as an accompaniment for ice-cream, etc.; it is also
inexpensive.</p>
<p>Apples preserved with a flavor of lemon and ginger are particularly nice
also; of course, they are not as firm as citron, and do not imitate so well the
ginger preserve. The outside of the water-melon (skinned) makes a clear, pretty
preserve, flavored in the same manner. The next in favor is the greengage
preserve, which is as clear and beautiful as it is delicate in flavor. Peaches,
unless made into marmalade, are better when canned with very little sugar than
when preserved. Canned peaches, half-frozen when served, make a delicious
dessert with cake.</p><pb n="249" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=255"/>
<p>First, then, for preserves the sirup must be made. I give the old rule; yet,
as before remarked, if canned, they may be made less sweet. I generally use
half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">SIRUP FOR
PRESERVES.</purpose>Put two pounds of the best <ingredient>white
sugar,</ingredient> with one pint of fresh, clear 
<ingredient>water,</ingredient> into a white porcelain saucepan; put it on the
fire, and before the sirup becomes hot mix well into it the partly beaten 
<ingredient>white of an egg.</ingredient> When it begins to boil, remove the
scum as it rises; watch it constantly that it does not boil over; and continue
to boil it until no more scum rises.</p>
<p><variation>Now <purpose>peach, pear, greengage, Siberian crab-apple, and
cherry preserves</purpose> are all made in the same manner. The 
<ingredient>peaches</ingredient> are neatly peeled, stoned, and halved. The 
<ingredient>pears</ingredient> are peeled, cored, and cut into two. The 
<ingredient>greengage</ingredient> makes a prettier preserve without being
skinned--pricking them, and halving the stem. The French preserve greengages in
this manner. Some think the skins of <ingredient>plums</ingredient> are tough
in preserves, and throw them into <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to
skin them. The <ingredient>Siberian crab-apple,</ingredient> which makes a very
good preserve, is cored with a small tin tube or 
<implement>corer</implement>(see page 57). Half of the stem is cut from 
<ingredient>cherries.</ingredient>When the sirup is gently boiling, a few
pieces are put into it at one time. They are boiled until they become just
soft. Do not allow them to break. When the pieces are done, take them carefully
out, and put more into the sirup until all are cooked; pour the sirup over, and
put them into jars.</variation></p>
<p>Many add a little <ingredient>juice of lemon</ingredient> to 
<ingredient>pear,</ingredient> <ingredient>crab-apple,</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>plum</ingredient> preserves. I would recommend a very little. In
the case of <ingredient>peaches,</ingredient> more flavor is gained by boiling
the <ingredient>pits,</ingredient> if they are cling-stone (which they should
be--the White Heath being the best preserving <ingredient>peach</ingredient>),
and after straining the <ingredient>water</ingredient> using it to make the
sirup. They will be firmer by laying the uncooked 
<ingredient>peaches</ingredient> into the sirup, and letting them remain in it
overnight, cooking them the next morning. Others harden 
<ingredient>fruit</ingredient> by letting it remain ten or fifteen minutes in 
<ingredient>alum-water.</ingredient> This impairs the flavor. However, for
good, clear preserves, I prefer the first method of preserving them, using the
pits for the <ingredient>water</ingredient> with which to make peach marmalade.
Peach marmalade<pb n="250" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=256"/> and peach preserves should be

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TO JELLY FRUITS.</purpose>To
make jelly clear, the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> must be quite fresh, and
all blemishes removed. Have the flannels used for straining perfectly clean and
white. Nearly all jellies are made in the same way, whether 
<ingredient>currant,</ingredient> <ingredient>plum,</ingredient> 
<ingredient>Siberian crab-apple,</ingredient> 
<ingredient>gooseberry,</ingredient> <ingredient>quince,</ingredient> 
<ingredient>apple,</ingredient> <ingredient>peach,</ingredient> or 
<ingredient>grape.</ingredient> Some add less <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to
the sweeter <ingredient>fruits.</ingredient> The first five 
<ingredient>fruits</ingredient> mentioned are exceedingly easy to jelly; the 
<ingredient>grape</ingredient> is often quite vexatious, with its perverse
inclinations. <ingredient>Cherries</ingredient> will not jelly without 
<ingredient>gelatine.</ingredient></p>
<p>After having freed the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> from all blemishes,
put them into a porcelain <implement>preserving-kettle,</implement> with only
enough clear <ingredient>water</ingredient> to keep them from burning at first.
Let them boil slowly until quite soft; then, putting them into a flannel cloth,
press from them all the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> possible. Strain the 
<ingredient>juice</ingredient> two or three times through a clean cloth; then
return it to the clean <implement>preserving-kettle,</implement> adding a cup
of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> for every cup of 
<ingredient>juice,</ingredient> and the beaten <ingredient>white of an
egg</ingredient> for the whole. The rule is to boil the sirup (without
stirring) very rapidly for twenty minutes, not counting the minutes until it
begins to boil. The safest rule is to boil it until it runs a little thick upon
the spoon; then let it run through the <implement>jelly-bag</implement> without
pressing it. If there is any fear of the jelly becoming too hard before it all
runs through, place it near the fire. The most convenient 
<implement>jelly-strainer</implement> is made by fastening the four corners of
a flannel cloth to a <implement>filter-stool</implement> (see page 57). If the
first dripping of the jelly is not entirely clear, return it to the strainer
until it runs perfectly limpid. Put the jelly into glasses; and, after it has
become quite firm, cut out little papers to fit the tops, which should be
dipped in brandy. Place over these second papers larger ones, which have been
dipped in the whites of eggs. Press the edges against the sides of the glasses,
to exclude the air.</p>

<p>"This receipt has three advantages: First, it never fails, as the old plan
is sure to do five times out of eight; secondly, it requires but half the usual
quantity of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> and so retains the grateful acidity
and peculiar flavor of the <ingredient>fruit;</ingredient> thirdly, it is by
far less troublesome than the usual method. Weigh the 
<ingredient>currants</ingredient> without taking the trouble to remove the
stems; do not wash them, but carefully remove leaves and whatever may adhere to
them. To each pound of <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> allow half the weight of 
<ingredient>granulated or pure loaf sugar.</ingredient> Put a few 
<ingredient>currants</ingredient> into a porcelain-lined kettle, and press them
with a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> or any thing convenient, in order
to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning; then add the remainder of the 
<ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> and boil freely for twenty minutes, stirring
occasionally to prevent burning. Take out and strain carefully through a
three-cornered bag of strong, close texture, putting the liquid into either
earthen or wooden vessels--never in tin, as the action of the acid on tin
materially affects both color and flavor. When strained, return the liquid to
the kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil thoroughly for a
moment or so, and then add the <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> The moment the 
<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, and
must be immediately dished, or placed in glasses. It will jelly upon the side
of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as the result. Gather the 
<ingredient>fruit</ingredient> early, as soon as fully ripe, since the pulp
softens and the juice is less rich if allowed to remain long after ripening. In
our climate, the first week in July is usually considered the time to make
currant jelly. Never gather <ingredient>currants</ingredient> or other soft or
small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving purposes, as they are
greatly impoverished by the moisture absorbed. <variation><purpose><alt

align="center">CHEESE.</hd>
<p>IN England, and at almost every well-appointed table in America, cheese is a
positive necessity to a good table. Brillat Savarin, in his "Physiologie du
Gout," says, "Un beau diner sans vieux fromage est une jolie femme &#224; qui
il manque un &#x0153;il."</p>
<p>Among the best cheeses of England are the Stilton and Cheshire; of France,
are those of Neufchatel, Brie (<emph rend="italic">fromage de Brie</emph>),
and<emph rend="italic">the fromage de Roquefort.</emph> The 
<emph rend="italic">fromage de Roquefort</emph> is, perhaps, one of the most
popular of all cheeses. The Gruy&#232;re cheese of Switzerland is also a
well-known cheese. It is made from new milk, and flavored with a powdered herb.
In serving this cheese, French mustard, pepper, and salt are usually passed at
the same time. The Roquefort cheese is made of a mixture of sheep's and goat's
milk: the first communicates consistence and quality; the latter, whiteness and
a peculiar flavor. The Parmesan (an Italian cheese) is made of skimmed milk. It
is a high-flavored and hard cheese, and is not sent to market until it is six
months old, and is often kept for three or four years. It is extensively used,
grated, for cooking. The Stilton cheese is made by adding the cream of the
preceding evening's milk to the morning's milking, producing a very rich and
creamy quality. This cheese is preferred by epicures when it is old, after
having been buried for some time in tin cans to become moldy. The Cheshire is
made with rich new milk. This cheese can be appreciated without cultivating a
taste for it.</p>
<p>Our American cheeses, since the introduction of the factory system, are
exported in immense quantities to England, where<pb n="263"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=269"/>they are much sought for, and considered by epicures as great
luxuries. This is generally astonishing to Americans abroad, who, at home,
often consider it only in rule to offer guests cheese of foreign manufacture. I
think, however, in comparison with our own, the celebrated foreign cheese have
one advantage. The latter take the name of the exact locality where they are
manufactured; consequently, when people speak of a Stilton or a 
<emph rend="italic">fromage de Brie</emph> they know exactly of what they are
talking; not so of American cheese. American cheese means that which may be
superior, good, bad, or indifferent: it is too general a name. America has
hundreds of cheese manufactories, and not a famous one; although many of them
make that which do credit to America as the greatest cheese-making country in
the world, if only these best specimens were more generally known.</p>
<p>I have taken great pains in trying to decide which of many samples is the
best American cheese, and have decided upon one made in Otsego County, New
York, which is called the "England dairy" cheese. Before proceeding any
further, I shall enter may protest against the name. Why do they not call it
Otsego cheese? If it were eaten in London, an Englishman would certainly
flatter himself that it was made in England. If they will only change the name,
then, I will take more pleasure in saying that the Otsego cheese is undoubtedly
one of the best specimens of American cheeses. It has a dark-yellow color, is
very rich, and highly flavored.</p>
<p>The pastures of Otsego County are exceptionally fine, and its general
advantages of climate, etc., render its locality one of the best adapted for
the manufacture of cheese.</p>
<p>One of the best specimens of cheese of a milder character, white and
well-flavored, is made at Milan, Cayuga County, New York, the name of which
might be Cayuga cheese.</p>
<p>Perhaps the cheapest of the foreign famous cheeses is the Neufchatel. It
comes in little rolls about an inch thick and three inches long, is enveloped
in tin-foil, and costs about twenty cents a roll. Two rolls are quite
sufficient for a large dinner. It is a delicious cheese. Care must be taken,
however, when purchasing, to ascertain that it is not musty.</p>
<pb n="264" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=270"/>
<p>The tariff may be saved by purchasing the Neufchatel manufactured in New
Jersey and Westchester County, New York. As for that, the Stilton made in
Cayuga County can hardly be detected from the Leicestershire manufacture
itself; and, in fact, nearly all the famous cheeses are very perfectly imitated
in America, so that those who choose may indulge in foreign names and encourage
home manufacture at the same time.</p>
<p>In serving Stilton cheese, the top should be cut off to form a cover, and
then the cheese should be neatly surrounded with a napkin. Whenever the cheese
is taken from the table, the cover should be replaced.</p>
<p>Cheeses are generally cut into little squares and passed in a glass
cheese-dish. No morsel of dried cheese should ever be thrown away, as it can be
used grated for macaroni, cheese omelets, etc.</p>
<p>Cheese should form a course at dinner. For further particulars concerning
cheese as a course, see page 345.</p>

of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> with the crust removed. While hot,

pan containing enough <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to half cover them;
they should be only slightly moistened. Now place each slice on a separate hot
plate, allowing one slice for each person at table; sprinkle over a little 
<ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and pour over them enough melted 
<ingredient>cheese</ingredient> to cover them. Select rich, new 
<ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> as it is more easily melted. It can be melted
in a little cup. It should not be made until almost ready to serve, as the

<p>This is a favorite dish for gentlemen's suppers or for lunch; yet it is

inches square, one of which, standing in a plate, is to be served to each
person at table. The reservoir contains boiling-hot water; the little platter

<p>THERE is not a more delicious dessert than that of Bavarian cream. These
creams are exceedingly easy to make, and, as they are prepared some time before
dinner, they have the advantage of being out of the way when cooking this meal.
They are a cheap country dessert, where one has plenty of cream, yet are not so
very expensive in the city, as it only requires a pint of common cream to make
a quart and a half of Bavarian cream.</p>
<p>When cream is thoroughly chilled, it is much more readily whipped. A pint
can be whipped in a few minutes with a little tin tube 
<implement>cream-whipper.</implement> If no whipper is at hand, beat the cream
with a fork, and skim of the whipped cream as it rises. It is always better not
to cook gelatine; it should be soaked in a little water near the fire for an
hour or two, when it will be entirely dissolved, and then it should be stirred
into the custard while it is still hot. In making the Bavarian creams, do not
add the whipped cream to the ingredients with the gelatine until they are quite
cold and are beginning to set, or they would otherwise dissolve the cream. The
ingredients will set very soon if placed on ice. The pine-apple Bavarian is
especially nice, and can be made with the canned pine-apple if the fresh
pine-apple can not be obtained; however, there is not much choice, as they are
all delicious.</p><pb n="283" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=289"/>
<p>The Bavarian creams all make good 
<emph rend="italic">charlottes-russe,</emph> the peach Bavarian making an

<emph rend="italic">charlotte</emph> molds; the cake is formed in molds a

before serving. When freezing the mixture, the whipped cream is not added until
the custard or ingredients with the gelatine are partly frozen.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">FROSTING.</purpose>The old way
of making frosting was a half-day's work. I now laugh at the extra exertion
once made to be sure that the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> were sufficiently
and properly beaten. The following is the true way to make frosting, which is
done and dried on the cake in ten minutes, allowing three minutes for the
making:</p>
<p>Use a heaping tea-cupful of fine <ingredient>pulverized sugar</ingredient>to
the <ingredient>white of each egg,</ingredient> or, say, a pound of 
<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to the <ingredient>whites of three
eggs.</ingredient> Beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> until they are
slightly 
<emph rend="italic">foaming</emph> only; do not beat them to a froth. The 
<ingredient>sugar</ingredient> may all be poured on the 
<ingredient>egg</ingredient> at once, or, if considered easier to mix, it may
be gradually added. Either way, as soon as the 
<ingredient>sugar</ingredient>and <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are thoroughly
stirred together, and flavored with a little <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> or 
<ingredient>vanilla,</ingredient> the icing is ready to spread over the cake.
It would be advisable to ice the cakes as soon as they are taken from the oven.
The icing made with the <ingredient>white of one egg</ingredient> is quite
sufficient to frost an ordinary-sized cake.</p>
<p>It is very little extra trouble to decorate a frosted cake. One can purchase
funnels for the purpose with different shaped ends. In place of no better
funnel, make a cornucopia of stiff writing-paper; fill it with the frosting,
and press it out at the small end, forming different shapes, according to
taste, over the cake. Little centre-pieces or leaves can always be purchased at
the confectioner's to aid in the decoration.</p><pb n="305" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=311"/>

<p>WITH a <implement>patent five-minute freezer</implement> (it really takes,
however, from fifteen minutes to half an hour to freeze any thing), it is as
cheap and easy to make ices in summer as almost any other kind of dessert. If
one has cream, the expense is very little, as a 
<implement>cream-whipper</implement> costs but twenty-five cents. A simple
cream, sweetened, flavored, whipped, and then frozen, is one of the most
delicious of ice-creams. By having the cream quite cold, a pint can be whipped,
with this <implement>cream-whipper,</implement> in five or ten minutes. It will
require ten cents' worth of ice--half of it to freeze the preparation, and the
other half to keep it frozen until the time of serving. Salt is not
proverbially expensive; a half-barrel or bushel of coarse salt will last a long
time, especially as a portion of it can be used a second time. In summer,
fruits, such as peaches or pears, quartered, or any kind of berries, are most
delicious half frozen and served with sugar. The chocolate ice-cream with fruit
is excellent. The devices of form for creams served at handsome dinners in
large cities are very beautiful; for instance, one sees a hen surrounded by her
chickens; or a hen sitting on the side of a spun-glass nest, looking sideways
at her eggs; or a fine collection of fruits in colors. One may see also a
perfect imitation of asparagus with cream-dressing, the asparagus being made of
the 
<emph rend="italic">pistache</emph> cream, and the dressing simply a whipped
cream. These fancy displays are, of course, generally arranged by the
confectioner. It is a convenience, of course, when giving dinner companies, to
have the dessert or any other course made outside of the house; but for
ordinary occasions, ices are no more troublesome to prepare
<pb n="307" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=313"/> than any thing else, especially when they can be
made early in the day, or even the day before serving.</p>

<pb n="315" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=321"/><hd align="center">COOKERY FOR THE SICK.</hd>
<p>I BELIEVE it is the general practice now to give a patient, in almost every
kind of illness, food that is very nourishing, yet very digestible, that the
system may become strengthened to throw off its disease.</p>
<p>I devote a chapter to "cookery for the sick," as it is such a useful and
delightful accomplishment to know just how to prepare the few available dishes
for invalids, so that while they may be most suitable food for the recovery of
the patient, they may at the same time be most agreeable to the taste and
pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>The three events of the day to the sufferer are the three meals. How
gratefully is it remembered if they have been delicately and carefully
administered! Let the mother or the wife prepare them with her own hands; let
her never ask an invalid what he will have to eat, but with thought and
ingenuity strive to vary the bill of fare each day, always providing proper
nourishment. This is an art in itself which can be delegated to no one. It is
worth as much to the suffering and beloved patient as is the medical
prescription of the physician.</p>
<p>Never leave an article of diet in the sick-room: it is a good means of
destroying the appetite, which should be encouraged and not weakened.</p>
<p>Whatever is served, let great attention be paid to giving the dish, after it
is properly cooked, a dainty appearance. Place it on the choicest of ware in
the house, with the cleanest of napkins, and the brightest of sliver, even if
that consists only of a tea-spoon.</p>
<p>If tea and toast be served, put the tea, freshly drawn, into the daintiest
of <implement>tea-cups.</implement> Every family might well afford to buy one
little, thin china cup and saucer, to use in case of illness; put a square of
loaf-sugar into it. A few drops of cream are easily saved for the patient's tea
from a small quantity of milk; and cream in small quantities is considered more
digestible than milk.</p>
<p>All cooks think they can make toast. There is about one person in ten
thousand who really does know how to make it;<pb n="316" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=322"/> who
actually appreciates the difference between a thin, symmetrical, well-yellowed,
crisp piece of toast with the crust cut off, and just from the fire, and a
thick, unshapely slice, unevenly crisped on the outside, and of doughy softness
in the centre. One is digestible; the other is exceedingly indigestible. The 
<emph rend="italic">scientific</emph> mode of making toast is explained on page
67.</p>
<p>Of the laxative articles of diet, undoubtedly one of the most important is
the oatmeal porridge. The chemists say, "Oatmeal stands before all other grains
in point of nutritive power." I do not mean to serve gruel, but a thicker
preparation, of considerable consistence, which is more palatable. The mode of
making it is explained on page 74. Put a heaping table-spoonful of this on a
thin saucer; pour some cream over it; then sprinkle over this a little
granulated sugar. Now place the saucer on a little 
<implement>salver,</implement> on which is spread the whitest of napkins.</p>
<p>Always remember that in cooking any of the grains, as, for instance,
corn-meal, oatmeal, hominy, cracked-wheat, etc., let them be thrown into 
<emph rend="italic">salted boiling</emph> water. This makes very great
difference in the flavor of the dish. Make every thing in small quantities, so
that the patient may always have his dishes 
<emph rend="italic">freshly</emph> made.</p>
<p>A very nourishing, digestible, and excellent dish for invalids is a raw,
fresh egg, the receipt for administering which is given among the invalid
receipts (see page 322).</p>
<p>In regard to rice, Dr. Lee remarks: "We regard rice as the most valuable of
all the articles of food in cases of the derangement of the digestive organs.
It nourishes, while it soothes the irritable mucous membrane; and while it
supports strength, never seems to aggravate the existing disease. For acute or
chronic affections of the alimentary canal, rice-water for drink and rice-jelly
for food seem peculiarly well adapted, and appear to exert a specific influence
in bringing about a recovery. These preparations are invaluable also in
convalescence from acute fevers and other maladies, and in the summer
complaints of young children."</p>
<p>Jellies made with gelatine or calf's feet are very appetizing, but must not
be relied on as furnishing much nourishment.<pb n="317" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=323"/> They
afford a pleasant vehicle for administering wine, of which the stimulating
properties are often very advantageous. I copy a short article from Booth's
"Chemistry" on the subject:</p>
<p>"Gelatine in domestic economy is used in the forms of soup and jelly as an
aliment; but though experiments seem to show that when mixed with fibrous,
albuminous, and caseous substances it becomes nutritive, this conclusion is yet
doubtful; for the theory of respiration proves that histrose, which produces
the gelatine, has accomplished its part in the animal organization, and can no
longer afford sustenance thereto. One fact, however, seems positive, and that
is its inability alone to yield nourishment to carnivorous animals. The feeble
nutritive power of a gelatinous matter seems to be owing to the destruction of
its organization."</p>
<p>On the same subject of the dietetical value of gelatine, Professor Youmans
says: "It is regarded as a product of the partial decomposition of albuminous
bodies in the system, but as incapable of replacing them when taken as aliment.
The French attempted to feed the inmates of their hospitals on gelatinous
extract of bones. Murmurs arose, and a commission, with Magendie at their head,
was appointed to investigate the manner. They reported gelatine as,
dietetically, almost worthless."</p>
<p>Graham bread, corn bread, or the Boston brown-bread, made with part rye
flour, are much more nourishing than breads made from bolted wheat. The whiter
the wheat flour, the more starch it contains, and the less gluten, which is
separated in bolting, and which is the nutritious, or flesh-producing portion.
The rich Boston brown-bread is especially good cut into thin, even pieces, with
a little cream, poured over it.</p>
<p>The value of corn-meal for invalids who are thin and incapable of
maintaining their natural warmth is scarcely appreciated. Indian-corn contains
a large percentage of oil, which is nourishing and fattening. Fat is the
heat-producing power.</p>
<p>As to the meats, it seems to me a mistake that that from the ox, with his
wholesome food, cleanly habits, sweet breath, and clear eye, is not the most
wholesome and digestible of aliments. Not meat is so tender and juicy as the
cut from the tenderloin or the porter-house steak.</p>
<pb n="318" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=324"/>
<p>Pork should be avoided in every form by invalids.</p>
<p>I can not but believe that rare-cooked, tender beef if the most valuable
dish in the culinary r&#233;pertoire for invalids; yet Dr. Beaumont, after
experimenting with St. Martin, ranks venison, when tender and in season, as the
most digestible and assimilable of meats. He classes mutton second; then beef.
Lamb is less digestible than mutton. Veal should be avoided as well as pork.
Fatty substances are also difficult of assimilation. Poultry is less digestible
than beef. Then, again, the manner of cooking beef has a great influence on its
digestibility. The best modes are broiling and roasting. Potatoes roasted or
baked are digested an hour sooner than potatoes boiled.</p>
<p>Before beginning the receipts for especial dishes, I will copy a little
story, which furnishes an illustration that the simplest modes of cooking are,
after all, the most satisfactory.</p>
<p>"The Vicomte de Vaudreuil, when appointed 
<emph rend="italic">charg&#233; d'affaires</emph> of France to the Court of
St. James's, brought over with him a young cook, an 
<emph rend="italic">&#233;l&#232;ve</emph> of the highest schools of the 
<emph rend="italic">cuisines</emph> of Paris. This young culinary aspirant to
fame, shortly after his arrival in London, obtained permission of his master to
go and witness the artistic operations of that established 
<emph rend="italic">cordon-bleu,</emph> Monsieur Mingay, the cook to Prince
Esterhazy, who had been brought up under the Prince Talleyrand's famous 
<emph rend="italic">chef,</emph> Louis, and previously under the most 
<emph rend="italic">bleu</emph> of all 
<emph rend="italic">cordons,</emph> the great Car&#234;me. On the 
<emph rend="italic">&#233;l&#232;ve's</emph> return, the Vicomte, hearing
that his cook was in a state of astonishment from something he had witnessed in
Prince Esterhazy's kitchen, summoned him to his presence, and said, "What is
this culinary miracle, which I have heard astonishes you, and casts into the
shade all other triumphs of the art?" Vatel's follower replied, "Oh, Monsieur
le Vicomte, when I entered the 
<emph rend="italic">cuisine</emph> at Chandos House it was near the time of the
prince's luncheon, for which his excellency had ordered something which should
be very simple and easily digestible, as he was suffering from languor. The 
<emph rend="italic">chef,</emph> Mingay, accordingly cut from under a well-hung
rump of beef three slices of fillet, and rapidly broiling them, he placed the
choicest-looking in the middle of a hot dish, and<pb n="319"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=325"/>afterward pressing the juice completely out of the remaining
two, he poured it on the first! Oh, monsieur, how great the prince! how great
the cook!'"</p><section class1="medhealth" class2="generalfood"><hd
align="center">RECEIPTS FOR THE SICK-ROOM.</hd>
<recipe class1="beverages" class2="medhealth">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">TEA.</purpose>Tea is best, made
fresh in the sick-room. A little 
<emph rend="italic">t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te</emph> china service is a
pretty ornament for a bedroom, and it is a convenient and tasteful arrangement
for serving tea to invalids. If one has no little tea-pot like that belonging
to the service here referred to, a small one of any other kind is
desirable.</p>
<p>Put two tea-spoonfuls of <ingredient>tea-leaves</ingredient> into the small
tea-pot; pour two tea-cupfuls of <ingredient><emph
rend="italic">boiling</emph>water</ingredient> over it; cover it closely, and
let it steam for a few moments.</p>
<p>With a small table at the side of the invalid's bed, it is a decidedly
pleasant little diversion to make tea in this manner, being sure at the same
time that it is perfectly fresh. However it is made though, do not present a
cupful of tea to a sufferer with a part of the tea spilled into the saucer.</p>
</recipe>
<p>To avoid having fat left in the soups, it is safer to allow them to get
entirely cold, when the fat can be easily skimmed off. Just enough can be
heated each time the soup is served.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">BEEF TEA, OR ESSENCE OF
BEEF.</purpose>Cut, say, a pound of perfectly <ingredient>lean

<implement>pickle-bottle</implement> answers the purpose), cork it tightly, and
place it in a pot of 
<emph rend="italic">cold</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which there
is a saucer at the bottom. Heat it gradually, then let it boil slowly for two
or three hours, when all the juice will be drawn out of the 
<ingredient>meat.</ingredient></p>
<p>Now pour off the <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> season it with 
<ingredient>salt</ingredient> carefully, as it requires very little. When it is
cold, skim off all the globules of fat.</p>
<p>This is an invaluable aliment for invalids who are very ill, or for weak
infants, when they need much nourishment in small compass. This beef tea can
then be given by the tea-spoonful at regular intervals, administering it as
medicine.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">BEEFSTEAK.</purpose>Cut out the
tender part of the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> from a 
<ingredient>porter-house or a tenderloin steak.</ingredient> The slice from
these <ingredient>steaks,</ingredient> if large, can be cut in two, as it is
sufficient for two meals for an invalid. Let it be three-quarters of an inch
thick; trim or press it into shape (it should be oval in form). Broil it
carefully over a hot fire, cooking it rare: the inside should be pink, not raw.
To cook it evenly without burning, turn it two or three times, but do not
pierce it with a fork nor squeeze it. It does not require over two minutes to
finish it. Do not put <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>salt</ingredient> over it until it is cooked, as 
<ingredient>salt</ingredient> rubbed on fresh 
<ingredient>meat</ingredient>contracts the fibres and toughens it. However, as
soon as it is cooked and placed on a little hot oval platter, sprinkle 
<ingredient>salt</ingredient> and<ingredient>pepper</ingredient> over it; then,
placing a small piece of fresh <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on the top, set
it into the oven a minute to allow the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> to soak
into the <ingredient>meat:</ingredient> it only requires a small piece of 
<ingredient>butter.</ingredient> <ingredient>Beefsteak</ingredient> swimming in
<ingredient>butter</ingredient> is unwholesome, and as slovenly as it is
wasteful.</p>
<p>If an invalid can eat <ingredient>beefsteak,</ingredient> he can generally
eat some one vegetable with it; and to make the little plump, tender morsel of 
<ingredient>beef</ingredient> look more tempting, garnish it with the
vegetable. If with <ingredient>potatoes,</ingredient> bake one or two
equal-sized <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> to a turn. When quite hot, remove
the inside; mash it perfectly smooth, season it with 
<ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or, what is better, 
<ingredient>cream</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and press it
through a <implement>colander.</implement> It will look like vermicelli. Place
it in a circle around the <ingredient>steak.</ingredient></p>
<p>If with <ingredient>pease,</ingredient> when they are out of season, the 
<ingredient>French canned pease</ingredient> or the American brand of 
<ingredient>"Triumph" pease</ingredient> with be found almost as good. One can,
if kept well covered, should furnish three or four meals for an invalid. Merely
heat them, adding a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and 
<ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Do not use much, it any, of the juice in
making a circle of them around the <ingredient>beef.</ingredient></p>
<pb n="329" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=335"/>
<p>If you garnish with <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> make them into a

watery part, add a little <ingredient>stock,</ingredient> if you have it
(however, it is nice without it, if the word 
<ingredient>stock</ingredient>frightens any body), and press it through the
sieve. Pour it around the <ingredient>steak.</ingredient></p>

beans,</ingredient> as well as <ingredient>string-beans,</ingredient>

<p>I am indebted to <attribution>Dr. Franklin, of St. Louis,</attribution> for
this little chapter. Appreciating his experience in the uses of prepared foods
for invalids, I asked his advice about certain ones, when he kindly sent me a
written opinion, which I insert 
<emph rend="italic">verbatim.</emph> Dr. Franklin says:</p>
<p size="smaller">"In the dietetic treatment of the sick, notwithstanding that
well-meaning and unwise friends often injure their patients by solicitations to
take more food, it is often one of the great difficulties to induce the invalid
to partake sufficiently of what is suitable, remembering that the body is
nourished by the assimilation of the food, and that the assimilating power is
weak, and can not be overtaxed. But the desire of food, and, indeed, the
assimilation, depend in a considerable degree on the manner in which it is
presented. It should not only please the eye and gratify the palate, but should
be varied in kind and method of preparation.</p>
<recipe class1="beverages" class2="medhealth">
<p size="smaller">"<ingredient rend="italic">Liebig's Extract of
Meat</ingredient> is an economical and valuable preparation. It is valuable in
nearly all cases of <purpose><emph rend="italic">physical</emph> debility and
extreme emaciation, especially after profuse losses of blood in collapse from
wounds; for patients suffering from severe and prolonged fevers in the last
stage of consumption; in bad cases of indigestion, when the stomach rejects all
solid food; and as an article of diet for nursing-mothers, etc.</purpose></p>
<p size="smaller"><variation>"In cases of <purpose>extreme
exhaustion,</purpose> the <ingredient>extract</ingredient> may be mixed with 
<ingredient>wine.</ingredient> As it is stimulating, it may take the place of
tea and coffee, and will be less liable than they to produce derangement of the
digestive organs. An advantage with this extract is that it can be readily
prepared.</variation></p>

<p size="smaller">"<emph rend="italic">Valentine's Extract of

of all the beef essences. As a medicinal agent, it will

persons (children as well) with weak constitutions.<ref
target="n11">*</ref></p>
<p size="smaller">"These beverages, in common with any nutritive soups, offer
to the patient whose general bodily functions are more or less suspended a
fluid and assimilable form of food. It is to this adaptation of nourishment to
the condition of the body that we must, in part at least, ascribe their
beneficial results. They have a remarkable power of restoring the vigorous
action of the heart, and dissipating the sense of exhaustion following severe,
prolonged exertion, and may be recommended in preference to the glass of wine
which some take after watching, preaching, prolonged mental effort, etc.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Rice (whole or ground), barley, etc., may often be
advantageously added to thicken beef tea.</p>
<p size="smaller">"<emph rend="italic">Gillon's Essence of Chicken.</emph>--A

<p size="smaller">"<emph rend="italic">Oatmeal Porridge.</emph>--When properly
made, this is both wholesome and nutritious, and especially suitable when a
patient does not suffer from water-brash, acidity, or from any form of bowel
irritation. It has long been the staple food of the Scotch, and produces good
muscular fibre and strong bone. It is a very nourishing diet for growing
children. The common oatmeal is not equal to the Scotch oatmeal; however, it is
not always easy to obtain the latter.</p>

<p size="smaller">"<emph rend="italic">Neave's Food.</emph>--Many years'
experience in the use of Neave's Farinaceous Food justifies the recommendation
of it as an excellent article of diet for infants, invalids, and persons of
feeble digestion. Competent chemical analysts have found the preparation to
contain every constituent necessary for the nourishment of the body, and this
has been abundantly confirmed by what we have frequently observed as the result
of its use. For infants it should be prepared according to the direction
supplied with the food, taking care not to make it too thick; it also makes a
very agreeable and highly nutritious gruel.</p>
<p size="smaller">"One precaution is necessary: Neave's food should be obtained
fresh and in good condition; if exposed too long, it deteriorates. Under
favorable circumstances it keeps good for from six to twelve months. It may
generally be procured in good condition from the leading homeopathic
druggists.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Ridge's, Hard's, and other farinaceous foods have their
advantages, and are preferred by some patients.</p>
<p size="smaller">"Those foods that are pure starch, as 'corn flour,' so
called, and all those which thicken in like manner, contain but a small
proportion of nutriment, being less sustaining and also more difficult of
digestion than ordinary stale bread. They are very unsuitable for young infants
and children suffering from diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, flatulence,
atrophy, or aphth&#230;.</p>
<p size="smaller">"In all cases, food which contains traces of bran, and also
gluten, gum, sugar, cellulose, and saline matter, especially the phosphates, in
proportion to the starch, are to be preferred. I prefer the Ridge's food for
nursing infants, but either may be used according to adaptability.</p>
<p size="smaller">"<emph rend="italic">Sugar of Milk.</emph>--A preparation of
cow's milk and sugar of milk forms a still lighter food, and one which, in the
case of very young infants, should be used to the exclusion of farinaceous
food. Cow's milk may be assimilated to human milk by dilution with water and
the addition of sugar of milk. Cow's milk contains more oil (cream) and
caseine, or cheese matter, but less sugar, than woman's. When necessary to
bring up a child by hand from birth, sugar of milk is more suitable to begin
with.</p>

"BABY."</hd>
<p>No particular diet can be recommended for the infant that is so unfortunate
as to be deprived of its natural nourishment. What agrees with one is quite
unsuccessful with another. Different kinds of diet can only be tested.
Children's little illnesses are often the result of food which, in their case,
is unassimilating and indigestible; and it is often better to attempt a change
of food than to resort to medicines.</p>
<p>City babies generally thrive poorly with cow's milk. Some can stand it,
however, diluting it with a third water, adding a slight thickening of rice,
well boiled and mashed, and also a little sugar. Others thrive well on goat's
milk, when no other kind will answer. The Borden condensed milk serves like a
charm with very young infants in cold weather; but in warm
<pb n="335" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=341"/> weather its excessive sweetness seems to cause
acidification when taken. In New York, where it may be obtained fresh, without
sweetening, I have heard that it is more satisfactory.</p>
<p>Some babies are ruddy and strong with an oatmeal diet (oatmeal porridge
strained and mixed with the milk). I have already mentioned this as especially
successful in Ireland and Scotland. However, in the warm climate of many of our
cities in summer I have known the oatmeal diet to cause eruptions or boils. It
is almost a crime to undertake to bring up children artificially in warm summer
climates. Many a heart-ache is caused when, failing to supply the natural food,
nothing would seem to agree with the baby.</p>

soup into the <implement>soup-plate,</implement> then a spoonful of the rice in

<p>Sometimes little squares (two inches square) of thin slices of brown bread
(buttered) are served with soup at handsome dinners. It is a French custom.

<p>The only vegetable to be served with fish is the plain boiled potato. It may
be cut into little round balls an inch in diameter, and served in little piles
as a garnish around the fish, or it may be the flaky, full-sized potato, served
in another dish. Some stuff a fish with seasoned mashed potatoes, then serve
around it little cakes of mashed potatoes, rolled in egg and bread-crumbs and
fried. Cucumbers, and sometimes noodles, are served with
fish.</p></section><section class1="meatfishgame" class2="menus"><hd

<p>Almost any vegetable may be served with beef. If potato is not served with
fish, it generally accompanies the beef, either as a bed of smooth mashed
potatoes around the beef, or 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la neige,</emph> or as fried potato-balls (<emph
rend="italic">&#224; la Parisienne</emph>), or, in fact, cooked in any of the
myriad different ways. At dinner companies, beef is generally served with a
mushroom-sauce. However, as any and all vegetables are suitable for beef, it is
only a matter of convenience which to choose. Horse-radish is a favorite beef
accompaniment.</p></section><section class1="meatfishgame" class2="menus"><hd

around a roast chicken. It is fashionable to serve salads with
chickens.</p></section><section class1="meatfishgame" class2="menus"><hd

<p>The unquestionable combination for pork is fried apples, apple-sauce,

served with apple-sauce or fried apples. Thin slices of breakfast bacon make a
savory garnish for beefsteak. Thin slices of pork, egged and bread-crumbed,
fried, and placed on slices of fried mush, make a nice breakfast dish; or it

class1="etiquette" class2="beverages"><hd align="center">SERVING OF WINES.</hd>
<p>At dinners of great pretension, from eight to twelve different kinds of
wines are sometimes served. This is rather ostentatious than elegant. In my
judgment, neither elegance nor good taste is displayed in such excess. Four
different kinds of wine are quite enough for the grandest occasions imaginable,
if<pb n="346" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=352"/> they are only of the choicest selection.
Indeed, for most occasions, a single wine--a choice claret or Champagne--is
quite sufficient. In fact, let no one hesitate about giving dinners without any
wine at all. Proper respect for conscientious scruples about serving wine would
forbid a criticism as to the propriety of serving any dinner without it. Such
dinners are in quite as good taste, and will be just as well appreciated by
sensible people; and it make very little difference whether people 
<emph rend="italic">who are not sensible</emph> are pleased or not.</p>
<p>If three wines are served, let them be a choice sherry with the soup, claret
with the first course after the fish, and Champagne with the roast. If a fourth
is desired, there is no better selection than a Ch&#226;teau Yquem, to be
served with an 
<emph rend="italic">entr&#233;e.</emph> If Champagne alone is used, serve it
just after the fish. Many serve claret during the entire dinner, it matters not
how many other varieties may be served; others do the same with Champagne--for
the benefit of the ladies, they say. I believe, however, Champagne is
considered with more disfavor every day. In England, punch is served with
turtle or mock-turtle soup. A receipt may be found for one of their best
punches (see page 339). I consider it, however, a decided mistake to serve so
strong a beverage, especially at the beginning of a dinner. A fine ale is often
served with the cheese-and-cracker course at family dinners, when wine is not
served.</p>
<p>As a rule, I would say that the white wines, Sauterne, Rhine, etc., are
served with raw oysters, or just before the soup; sherry or Madeira, with the
soup or fish; Champagne, with the meat; claret, or any other of the red wines,
with the game. Many prefer claret just after the fish, as it is a light wine,
and can be drunk instead of water. If still another wine is added for the
dessert, it is some superior sherry, port, Burgundy, or any fine wine. Very
small glasses of 
<emph rend="italic">liqueurs,</emph> such as maraschino and cura&#231;oa, are
sometimes served at the end of a dinner after coffee.</p>
<p>In France, coffee (<emph rend="italic">caf&#233; noir</emph>) is served
after the fruit at dinner, a plan which should be generally followed at dinner
parties at least. It is always well to serve cream and sugar with coffee, as
many prefer it.</p><section class1="beverages"><pb n="347"
id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=353"/><hd align="center">PROPER TEMPERATURE IN WHICH WINES SHOULD
BE SERVED.</hd>
<p>Sherry should be served thoroughly chilled.</p>
<p>Madeira should be neither warm nor cold, but of about the same temperature
as the room.</p>
<p>Claret should be served at the same temperature as Madeira, never with ice;
it should remain about forty-eight hours standing, then decanted, care being
observed that no sediment enter the <implement>decanter.</implement></p>
<p>Champagne should either be kept on ice for several hours previous to
serving, or it should be half frozen; it is then called 
<emph rend="italic">Champagne frapp&#233;.</emph> It is frozen with some
difficulty. The ice should be pounded quite fine, then an 
<emph rend="italic">equal</emph> amount of salt mixed with it. A quart bottle
of Champagne well surrounded by this mixture should be frozen in two hours, or,
rather, frozen to the degree when it may be poured from the
bottle.</p></section><section class1="beverages"><hd>TREATMENT OF WINES.</hd>
<p>Connoisseurs on the subject of wine say much depends upon its treatment
before it is served; that it is invariably much impaired in flavor through
ignorance of proper treatment in the cellar; and that a wine of ordinary grade
will be more palatable than one of better quality less carefully managed. They
say wine should never be allowed to remain in case, but unpacked, and laid on
its side. Above all, wine should be stored where it is least exposed to the
changes of temperature.</p>
<p>All red wines should be kept dry and warm, especially clarets, which are
more easily injured by cold than by heat. Consequently, on account of the rigor
of our winters, clarets are better stored in a closet on the second floor (not
too near a register) than in a cellar. Champagnes and Rhine wines stand cold
better than heat, which frequently causes fermentation. The warmer sherry,
Madeira, and all spirits are kept, the better.</p></section><section
class1="marketing"><hd align="center">CHOICE OF BRANDS</hd>
<p>Champagne.--Perhaps the choicest brands of Champagne are Pomm&#233;ry
(dry, supposed to mean less sweet), Giesler (sweet), Veuve Cliquot (sweet), and
Roederer (sweet). The<pb n="348" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=354"/> best of the cheaper
Champagnes are Charles Roederer, Heidsick, Montebello, and Krug.</p>
<p><emph rend="italic">Claret.</emph>--Choicest brands: Ch&#226;teaux La Rose,
Ch&#226;teau la Tour, Ch&#226;teau Lafitte, or Ch&#226;teau Margeaux. Best

<p><emph rend="italic">Sauterne.</emph>--Best: Ch&#226;teau Yquem, La Tour

<p>The American dry wines are most excellent, and might be more patronized by
those who know no other wine than that of foreign manufacture. The Missouri
Catawba and Concord wines are especially good; so are some of the California
wines. The Ohio Catawba is quite noted.</p></section><section

class1="etiquette" class2="menus"><hd align="center">TO PREPARE COMPANY
DINNERS.</hd>
<p>IT is very simple to prepare a dinner served 
<emph rend="italic">&#224; la Russe,</emph> as it matters little how many
courses there may be. If it were necessary to prepare many dishes, and to have
them all hot, and in perfection at the same minute, and then be obliged to
serve them nearly all together, the task might be considered rather formidable
and confusing. But with one or two assistants, and with time between each
course to prepare the succeeding one, after a very little practice it becomes a
mere amusement.</p>
<p>The soup, or the stock for the soup, and the dessert, should be made the day
before the dinner.</p>
<p>A bill of fare should be written, and pinned up in the kitchen. Every thing
should be prepared that is possible in the early part of the day; then, after
the fish, chickens, birds, etc., are dressed and larded (if necessary), they
should be put aside, near the ice. If sweet-breads are to be served, they
should be larded, parboiled, and put away also. The salad (if lettuce) should
be sprinkled with water (not placed 
<emph rend="italic">in</emph> water), and put in a cool, dark place in a
basket, not to be touched until the last three minutes.</p>
<pb n="350" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=356"/>
<p>The plates and platters for each course should be counted, examined, and
placed on a table by themselves. However, the arrangement of the dishes was
explained in the chapter on setting the table.</p>
<p>After this, the kitchen should be put in order, and the tables cleared of
all unnecessary things. Then every thing needed for the courses to be cooked
should be placed in separate groups at the back of a large table, so that there
may be no confusion or loss of any thing at the last minute. If there are
sweet-breads, have them egged and bread-crumbed; if pease are to be served with
them, place them in a basin at their side, properly seasoned. If there is
macaroni with cheese, have the proper quantity desired already broken on a
dish, with a plate of grated cheese and a tin cup, with the necessary amount of
butter to be melted, side by side. If there is a fillet of beef to be baked and
served with a mushroom-sauce, have the fillet in the 
<implement>baking-pan</implement> already larded, the mushrooms in the basin in
which they are to be cooked, at the side; also the piece of lemon and the
spoonful of flour ready. The stock will be in the kettle at the back of the
stove. By-the-way, in giving a fine dinner, there should always be an extra 
<implement>stock-pot,</implement> separate from the soup, at the back of the
stove, as it is excellent for boiling the sweet-breads or the macaroni, and
making the sauces, etc.</p>
<p>If a simple salad of lettuce is to be served, have the oil, vinegar, pepper
and salt, and the spoonful of finely chopped onion, in a group all ready. If a 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> dressing is to be served, that should be
made in the morning.</p>
<p>Look at the clock in the kitchen, and calculate the time it will take each
dish to cook, and put it to the fire, so that it will be finished "to a turn"
just at the proper minute.</p>
<p>During dinner, one person should attend to placing out of the way all the
dishes brought from the dining-room, and, if necessary, should wash any spoons,
platters, etc., which may be needed a second time. She should know beforehand,
however, just what she is to wash, as every one must know exactly her own
business, so that no questions need be asked at the last moment. The cook can
attend to nothing but the cooking, at the risk of neglecting this most
important part.</p><pb n="351" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=357"/>
<p>As the course just before the salad is sent into the dining-room, begin to
make the salad, having every thing all ready. First, pick over the
lettuce-leaves, wash and leave them to drain, while you prepare the dressing.
It should 
<emph rend="italic">just</emph> be ready when its turn comes to be sent to
table.</p>
<p>If the dinner company is very large, and there are many dishes, the cooking
of them may be distributed between two persons, and perhaps the second cook may
use the laundry stove; but with a little practice and the one or two
assistants, 
<emph rend="italic">one</emph> cook can easily prepare the most elaborate
dinner, if it is only properly managed before the time of cooking. She should,
of course, never attempt any dish she has not made before. A 
<implement rend="italic">bain-marie</implement> is very convenient for
preserving cooked dishes, if there is some delay in serving the dinner.</p>
<p>Of all things, never on any occasion serve a large joint or large article of
any kind on a little platter, as nothing looks so awkward. Let the platter
always be at least a third larger than the size of its contents.</p>
<p>I give several bills of fare. They are long enough and good enough for any
dinner party. Guests do not care for better or more, if these are only properly
cooked. They can be easily prepared in one's own house, and this is always more
elegant than to have a list of a hundred dishes from a restaurant.</p><section

<p>This is a bill of fare seen very often at dinner parties. It is not
difficult to prepare, as there are only five of the courses which are
necessarily prepared at dinner-time. The oyster course is very simple, and may
be placed on the table before the guests enter the dining-room. This soup may
be made the day before, and only reheated at the time of serving. The Saratoga
potatoes may be made in the morning; and if the 
<emph rend="italic">charlotte-russe</emph> is not purchased at a restaurant, it
may be made the day before. So, after the quails are broiled or roasted, the
cook has nothing more to do but to make the salad, which is an affair of three
minutes, and the coffee, for which she has a long time, the coffee having been
ground and in readiness in the <implement>coffee-pot</implement> two or three
hours before dinner. The four last courses before the coffee are easily
purchased outside. The cheese might be a Neufchatel or a Roquefort. The 
<emph rend="italic">charlotte</emph> and the ice-cream can come from the
confectioner's. The fruit is on the table during the dinner as one of the

<p>Necessary--a soup-bone, a soup-bunch, with plenty of parsley, a large
chicken, half a pound of macaroni, a half-pint can of tomatoes, three-fourths
of a tea-cupful of rice.</p>
<p>Make the 
<emph rend="italic">Mayonnaise</emph> dressing with three eggs in the morning.
Use the whites of the eggs for the corn-starch pudding, which make at the same
time, and put away in a mold to harden. Also put aside the rice to soak in cold
water.</p>
<p>Five hours before dinner, put on the soup-bone, with the neck of the chicken
also, as every little adds. An hour before dinner, cut up the soup-bunch,
saving part of it for the tomato-sauce, as one or two sprigs of the parsley and
a small onion. Put the remaining vegetables (frying the onion) into the soup,
leaving only a sprig of parsley for the chicken. Cut up the pieces of chicken,
which fry or 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;</emph> brown in some hot drippings; put them
then into a <implement>stew-pan.</implement> Add to the drippings (about a
table-spoonful) a tea-spoonful of flour, and, when rubbed smooth, a pint of hot
water, a ladleful of the soup taken from the 
<implement>soup-kettle,</implement> and a sprig of parsley chopped fine. Add
this now to the fried pieces of chicken in the 
<implement>stew-pan;</implement>let them simmer until about five minutes before
dinner.</p>
<p>For the soup, cut some bread into rather large dice, say three-quarters of
an inch square; fry, or rather 
<emph rend="italic">saut&#233;,</emph> them in a little butter, turning all
sides of the bread to allow it to become brown. Place the dice in the open
oven, or at the back of the range, to become perfectly dry before the
dinner-hour. Half an<pb n="358" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=pcdg&#38;PageNum=364"/> hour before dinner, put the
macaroni to boil in another ladleful of stock mixed with some salted boiling
water. Now make the tomato-sauce: make it as in receipt, and place it at the
side of the fire or in the <implement rend="italic">bain-marie</implement>until
the macaroni is done. Put on the rice to boil for about fifteen minutes in a
little salted boiling water.</p>
<p>Just before serving the dinner is the busiest time. Strain the macaroni, and
mix it with the sauce; put it into the oven for a few minutes to soak. Strain
the soup, remove all the grease, and season it with pepper and salt. Put the
bread dice, or 
<emph rend="italic">cro&#251;tons,</emph> into the 
<implement>soup-tureen,</implement> pour over the soup, and send it to table.
Take out the pieces of chicken, which arrange neatly on a warm platter; strain
the stock in which it was boiled, remove all the fat, add the rice to it,
season with pepper and salt, and let it simmer on the fire until it is time to
be served, and then pour it over the chickens, and send them into the
dining-room. The lettuce is next washed and dressed; afterward the pudding is
turned from the mold, and decorated with the circle of peach
marmalade.</p></section></chapter></body><back><div type="glossary">

<p>THE IDEAL LEMON PIE.--Several requests to republish this recipe having been
received, it is presented here with:</p>
<p>"I have at last 
<unclear>reduced</unclear> lemon pie to a science. Mine are 
<unclear>now</unclear> so delicious that 
<unclear>A. longs</unclear> for dinner time to come. This is my recipe: A.
prefers tarts so I take my <implement>biscuit-cutter</implement> and cut from
puff paste very thinly rolled around the edge I curl a narrow strip of the
paste, and bake these shells. While they are baking I prepare the following
filling, which 'is very fillin' at the price': I take my lemon and do not roll
it--cause why? it grates better when it is firm. After the yellow ring is all
grated into a bowl, I squeeze in the juice, and if any little cells go in I do
not say them nay, I then put in a cup of sugar and the yolk of one egg, stir
well together. Upon this I pour a large cup of cold water (no milk), into which
has been stirred a dessert-spoonful of corn starch. I put all into a saucepan
and stir until it is cooked into a rich, clear, straw-colored jelly. My shells
now being baked to look as much as possible as if they had come from 
<unclear>Rogers's,</unclear> I fill them, and from the white of the egg make a
meringue to softly cover each. I pop them into the oven one brief instant, and
then draw them out a rich 
<unclear>sunset</unclear> yellow, and, stepping upon 'Vevie' and the 
<unclear>cat</unclear> alternately. I bear them in triumph to the pantry to
cool. You will get this in the morning; make some for dinner and you will be
happy. N. B.--The 
<unclear>crust</unclear> being baked separately, it never soaks."</p>
<p>VANILLA CREAM WITH FRUIT SAUCE.-Make a nice custard with a pint of rich milk
and the yolks of five eggs, a 
<unclear>scant</unclear> cup of sugar and vanilla to taste. When this custard
thickens take it off the fire, and add, while still hot, half a box of gelatine
previously dissolved in cold water. Wet a mould, pour in the 
<unclear>cream,</unclear> and set it on ice. When set turn it out on a deep
dish, arrange a bunch of fine candied cherries on top, and pour around it a
sauce made of red cherries stewed, sweetened, strained and slightly thickened
with corn starch.</p></div><div type="other"><pb n="blank"
