<p>Perhaps there is no better way of presenting to the public the facts which led to the creation of this valuable work, than by inserting the announcement which resulted in the exceedingly lively and able competition for the prize, as well as the merited honor which was certain to fall upon the successful competitor. It read as follows:</p>
<subdiv>
<hd>AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION.<lb/>THE LOMB PRIZE ESSAYS.<lb/><emph rend="italic">Two Prizes for</emph> 1888.</hd>
<p>Mr. Henry Lomb, of Rochester, N.Y., now well known to the American public as the originator of the "Lomb Prize Essays," offers, through the American Public Health Association, two prizes for the current year, on the following subject:</p>
<p align="center">PRACTICAL SANITARY AND ECONOMIC COOKING<lb/>ADAPTED TO PERSONS OF MODERATE<lb/>AND SMALL MEANS.</p>
<p align="center">First Prize, $500, - - - Second Prize, $200.</p>
<p>JUDGES: Prof. Charles A. Lindsley, New Haven, Conn.; Prof. George H. Roh&#233;, Baltimore, Md.; Prof. Victor C. Vaughan, Ann Arbor, Mich.; Mrs. Ellen H. Richards, Boston, Mass.; Miss Emma C.G. Polson, New Haven, Conn.</p>
<p>CONDITIONS: The arrangement of the essay will be left to the discretion of the author. They are, however,
<pb n="iii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=7"/>
expected to cover, in the broadest and most specific manner, methods of cooking as well as carefully prepared receipts, for three classes,--(1) those of moderate means; (2) those of small means; (3) those who may be called poor. For each of these classes, receipts for three meals a day for several days in succession should be given, each meal to meet the requirements of the body, and to vary as much as possible from day to day. Formulas for at least twelve dinners, to be carried to the place of work, and mostly eaten cold, to be given. Healthfulness, practical arrangement, low cost, and palatableness should be combined considerations. The object of this work is for the information of the housewife, to whose requirements the average cook-book is ill adapted, as well as to bring to her attention healthful and economic methods and receipts.</p>
<p>All essays written for the above prizes must be in the hands of the Secretary, Dr. Irving A. Watson, Concord, N.H., on or before September 15, 1888. Each essay must bear a motto, and have accompanying it a securely sealed envelope containing the author's name and address, with the same motto upon the outside of the envelope.</p>
<p>After the prize essays have been determined upon, the envelopes bearing the mottoes corresponding to the prize essays will be opened, and the awards made to the persons whose names are found within them. The remaining envelopes, unless the corresponding essays are reclaimed by authors or their representatives within thirty days after publication of the awrads, will be destroyed, unopened, by the Secretary.</p>
<p>None of the judges will be allowed to compete for a prize.</p>
<p>The judges will announce the awards at the Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association, 1888.</p>
<p>It is intended that the above essays shall be essentially American in their character and application, and
<pb n="iv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=8"/>
this will be considered by the judges as an especial merit.</p>
<p>Competition is open to authors of any nationality, but all the papers must be in the English language.</p>

<p align="right" rend="italic">Secretary.</p>
<p>CONCORD, N. H., February, 1888.</p>
</subdiv>
<p>The above circular was extensively circulated and published throughout the United States and the Dominion of Canada, with the result of bringing to the Secretary, within the specified time, <emph rend="italic">seventy essays</emph> upon the subject announced. The arrival of these essays covered a period of nearly five months, and they were forwarded to the Chairman of the Committee of Award nearly as fast as received, thus giving the committee ample time for their exceedingly laborious work of examination. The decision of the judges was announced at the Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association, and was as follows:</p>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE LOMB PRIZES.</hd>
<p>Your committee, to whom were referred the essays upon "Practical Sanitary and Economic Cooking Adapted for Persons of Moderate and Small Means," respectfully report that they have perused with thoughtful and considerate attention the three score and ten essays which were submitted to them.</p>
<p>A few of them were presented in beautiful specimens of type-writing, but the great majority of them were in manuscript, and some of them not in the most legible characters, a circumstance which, it will be appreciated, became an important matter, when considered in connection with the large number of competitors, and the fact that many of their papers were each of several hundred pages in length.</p>
<pb n="v" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=9"/>
<p>The result of the labors of the committee is, that by unanimous approval, the first prize of $500 is awarded to the author of the essay bearing this inscription,-"The Five Food Priciples, illustrated by Practical Recipes."</p>
<p>Your committee would further report that although there were among the remaining sixty-nine a number of essays of considerable merit, there was no single one so prominently superior to others as to commend the approval of the majority of your committee, nor was there any which did not contain some errors of statement, which your committee did not feel justified in endorsing with the approval of this Association by the bestowal of a prize, or else which did not fall to meet some of the conditions upon which the prize was offered, or which was not otherwise objectionable because of literary defects.</p>
<p>Your committee would therefore respectfully report that no essay was found among those submitted to them which they judged deserving of the second prize of $200.</p>
<p>The committee consider it a duty, in awarding the prize, to emphasize the fact that of all the essays submitted the one selected is not only predominantly the best, but that it is also intrinsically an admirable treatise on the subject.</p>
<p>It is simple and lucid in statement, methodical in arrangement, and well adapted to the practical wants of the classes to which it is addressed. Whoever may read it can have confidence in the soundness of its teachings, and cannot fail to be instructed in the art of cooking by its plain precepts, founded as they are upon the correct application of the scientific principles of chemistry and physiology to the proper preparation of food for man.</p>
<p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>The American public is to be congratulated upon this useful and valuable contribution to the needs of its great army of working people, made possible through the humanitarian benevolence of a private citizen. This was the fifth prize offered by the same citizen, through the same channel, for the noble purpose of ameliorating, in some degree, the hardships which befall mankind in the tireless struggle for existence.</p>
<p>That this essay may be placed in the hands of every family in the country, is his earnest desire as well as that of the Association; therefore a price barely covering the cost has been placed upon this volume. It is to be hoped, that Government departments, state and local boards of health, sanitary and benevolent associations, manufacturers, employers, etc., will purchase editions at cost, or otherwise aid in distributing this work among the people.</p>
<p>Although a copyright has been placed upon these essays for legitimate protection, permission to publish under certain conditions, can be obtained by addressing the secretary.</p>
<p>We commend this volume to the public, believing it to be an unequaled work upon "Practical Sanitary and Economic Cooking, adapted to persons of moderate and small means."</p>

<hd align="center">INTRODUCTION.</hd>
<p>Few things are of more importance than that we should find ourselves physically and mentally equal to our day's work, but not many of us realize how largely this depends upon the food we eat.</p>
<p>Supposing there to be just money enough in a given family to buy the right kind and quantity of food. Now if this money is not wisely expended, or if after the food has been bought it is spoiled in the cooking, the results will be very serious for the members of that family; they will be under-nourished and they will suffer in clear-headedness, bodily strength, and in the case of children, in bodily development.</p>
<p>Surely the right condition of the body is too important to be left to chance; the best scientific knowledge, the best practical heads should be at its service, and this is the case, indeed, to a large extent in Europe, where the food of the soldiers and of the inmates of public institutions is furnished more or less according to certain rules that have been deduced partly from observation, and partly from scientific experiment.</p>
<p>The application of scientific principles on these lines is not of long standing, for the investigations that have clinched them are all of comparatively recent date. At
<pb n="2" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=14"/>
the end of the last century a beginning was made in France and in Germany in connection with philanthropic efforts to improve the food of the poor, and it was at this time that Count Rumford introduced into the soup kitchens of Munich, the soup that has been named after him. From this time on interest in the subject of foods, both for men and domestic animals, steadily increased, although experimenters were constantly coming to wrong conclusions because the sciences of Organic Chemistry and Physiology, as far as they concerned the subject, were not far enough advanced.</p>
<p>It was only in the early forties that the first experimental agricultural stations were established, but so rapidly have they multiplied that they now number more than a hundred in Europe alone; and in these and in the laboratories of the great universities, analyses have been made of most of the foods used by men and animals, and also tests of the relative flesh and fat producing power of different foods and combinations of foods.</p>
<p>For years the results of these investigations have been applied with profit to the feeding of cattle, but it was a case of threatened wholesale starvation in England that first turned the attention of properly trained persons to a like study of the nourishment of human beings. During our civil war the condition of the cotton spinners in Lancashire and Cheshire, England, became so serious as to make governement help necessary to keep them from starving, and in 1862 and 1863 Dr. Edward Smith was commissioned to examine into the the dietetic needs of the distressed operatives.
<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=15"/>
In his report for 1863 are found tables of the food consumed per week by 634 families, and in spite of the difficulties standing in the way of such an investigation, the foods consumed were classified into tables showing the amounts of the different food principles taken per week by each family.</p>
<p>One of the great practical results following from this investigation was the determination of the minimum amount of each nutritive principle which men, women and children need, to keep them in fair health. The amount of food with which an unemployed man can fight off starvation, and the diseases temporarily incident to it, was found to be represented in 35 ounces of good bread per day, and the necessary amount of wholesome water.</p>
<p>Since the publication of Dr. Smith's report similar inquiries have been instituted by the scientists of other countries, and many analyses have been made of the exact amount and kinds of food eaten by various classes of laborers under the most varied conditions. Professors Voit and Pettenkofer of Munich have even accounted for every particle of food that passed through the body of a man, both while he was at work and while he was idle. They have also noted how much of his own body was consumed when he ate nothing. Finally, a great number of averages have been taken and so-called "standard dietaries" constructed, by which is meant the average amount of each of the chief food principles that keep an average muscle-worker in good condition, when doing average work.</p>
<p>Every one will admit that it is of great importance
<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=16"/>
for the farmer to know in what proportion he shall lay in hay and other food for the winter feeding of his stock; the animals must thrive, but there must be no waste by furnishing food in the wrong quantities or proportions.</p>
<p>For the housewife, the food question in its relation to her family can be stated in the very same words. It is important that she should economize, but her path will be full of pitfalls if she does not understand in what true economy consists. Most people with a real interest in this subject, have had at some period of their lives certain pet theories as to food. Perhaps they have been at one time convinced that most people ate too much, at another, that meat was the all strengthener, or they may have been afflicted with the vegetarian fad, and whatever their special views have been they have thought that they rested them upon facts. But surely they would never have pinned their faith to one-sided diets if they had rightly comprehended the main facts of nutrition. We believe that if these facts as at present interpreted, and the world's experience in applying them, can be put at the command of the housewife, she can use them to great profit.</p>
<p>We have employed the term "food principles"; what do we mean by it? Everyone knows what is meant by a food, as meat or bread, and everyone knows that the food offered us by our butchers and grocers comes from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The oxygen we breathe and the water we drink nature furnishes for us directly, so to speak, though unfortunately for many of us, and especially
<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=17"/>
for young children, the former is not thought of as a food. Oxygen aside, it has been found by those who have studied the matter, that all foods contain one or more of five classes of constituents, called "nutritive ingredients" or "food principles." These five principles are:</p>
<list><item>(1) Water.</item>
<item>(2) Proteids.</item>
<item>(3) Fats.</item>
<item>(4) Carbohydrates.</item>
<item>(5) Salts or mineral constituents.</item>
</list>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">WATER.</hd>
<p>It is important to note that our bodies when full-grown are two-thirds water, and that our food contains from 1 to 94% of it. Considering the scope of this essay, it must be left to take care of itself as a food.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">PROTEIDS.</hd>
<p>A class of nearly allied bodies is included under this head. The whole class is sometimes called "Albumens."</p>
<p>The housewife is familiar with proteids in such foods as the lean of meat, in eggs and cheese. These contain the principle in various proportions; for example,</p>

<hd align="center">FATS.</hd>
<p>Fats are obtained from both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Those used by us in cookery come mostly from animals, and are known to the housewife as butter, lard and tallow. Vegetable food as a rule, is very poor in fats, containing from 0 to 3% only.</p>
<p>Some of the cereals, like corn and oats contain from 4 to 7% of fats.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">CARBOHYDRATES.</hd>
<p>The bodies classed as "carbohydrates" are found mainly in vegetables. The housekeeper knows them as starches and sugars.</p>
<p>Under the starches proper are included such things as the starches of grains and seeds, Iceland moss, gums, and dextrin.</p>
<p>Milk is one of the few animal products that has more than a very small quantity of carbohydrates. It contains on the average about 4.8% of this principle;--slightly more than of either proteids or fats.</p>

<pb n="7" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=19"/>
calcium phosphate, and the common salt with which we flavor our food, illustrate this class.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">FUNCTIONS OF FOOD PRINCIPLES.</hd>
<p>To know in what proportion these food principles should be represented in our diet, we must inquire into the part played by each of them in the body. The first and the last principle may be dismissed briefly. The former, water, is the great medium which floats things through the body; the latter, salts, are combined in various ways with the solids and fluids of our foods, and we shall not easily suffer from lack of them.</p>
<p>The other three food principles (let us call them in the following pages the three great food principles), cannot be so summarily dealt with. We might say, briefly and dogmatically, that the proteids are "flesh foods," the fats are "heat foods," the carbohydrates "work foods." To be sure, experimenters are agreed on the main points, but the different schools are still at war on the final explanations and on many details, and it has become more and more evident that we cannot portion off the work of the body in this simple style. Though each of the three great food principles can be said to have a favorite part which it plays better than any other, yet we find that like an actor of varied talents, it has more than one role in its repertoire.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">FUNCTION OF PROTEIDS.</hd>
<p>That this class is indispensable we have the best of proofs. It must be given us in one or another of its
<pb n="8" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=20"/>
forms, for, even if we are not athletes, nearly one half of our body is made up of muscle which is one fifth proteid, and the nitrogen in this proteid can only be furnished by proteid again, since neither fats nor carbohydrates contain any of it; therefore in making up bills of fare, let us remember that growing and working proteid, yes, even idle proteid as Dr. Smith found, needs proteid, and that there is nothing in any of the other food principles that can entirely take its place.</p>
<p>Though we think of proteid mostly as a great body builder and restorer, it can also to some extent furnish fat when it stands in a certain relation to the fats and carbohydrates of our food, and we are assured by experimenters that it also furnishes heat and muscle energy under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In these last two activities, however, it is far excelled by fats and carbohydrates. We shall therefore think of it as the nitrogen-furnisher of our tissues, and also as the grand stimulant among foods, inciting the body, as it does, to burn up more of other kinds.</p>
<p>Scientists, at one time, held the opinion that our muscle energy comes chiefly from proteids. This view has been abandoned, but many a working man still believes that meat is the only kind of food that is of any account; he thinks of fats and starches as quite unimportant comparatively. Now it has been proved over and over again, that we can combine meat with fats and vegetable food in such a proportion that it shall play only its main r&#243;le, viz., that of building and restoring, while these latter furnish the heat and
<pb n="9" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=21"/>
muscle energy needed. Proteid food is such a costly article that it will not do to put it at work which cheaper material can do even better.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">FUNCTION OF FATS.</hd>
<p>The fats also have more than one office in the body. They can be stored as body fat, or they can be burned and give off heat, and they may also serve as a source of muscular energy, in an indirect manner at least.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">FUNCTION OF CARBOHYDRATES.</hd>
<p>The Carbohydrate principle furnishes fat to our tissues, and is a source of heat and muscle energy, indeed the chief source of muscle energy in all ordinary diets.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">FLAVORINGS.</hd>
<p>So far we have had chiefly in mind the real working constituents of food, if we may so speak. But many things cannot be studied or classified in the above way; they must be looked at from another point of view.</p>
<p>Thus, a pinch of pepper, a cup of coffee, a fine, juicy strawberry,--what of these? They may contain all five of the food principles, but who cares of the proteid action or carbohydrate effect of his cup of good coffee at breakfast, or what interest for us has the heating effect of the volatile oil to which the strawberry owes a part of its delicious taste?</p>
<p>Surely the economical housekeeper who would throw out of the list of necessaries all the things that tickle the palate, that rouse the sense of smell, that
<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=22"/>
please the eye and stimulate our tired nerves, just because these things contain but little food, would make a grave mistake. She may know just what cuts of meat to buy, what vegetables are most healthful and economical, but if she does not understand how to "make the mouth water," her labor is largely lost. Especially if she has but little money, should she pay great attention to this subject, for it is the only way to induce the body to take up plain food with relish.</p>
<p>The list of these spices, flavors, harmless drinks and the like, is a long one. Unfortunately, we have no comprehensive word that will include everything of the sort, from a sprig of parsley to a cup of coffee; the Germans calls them "Genuss-mittel"--"pleasure-giving things."</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">PROPORTIONS AND AMOUNTS OF FOOD PRINCIPLES.</hd>
<p>We have brought our discussion of the three great food principles to the point where we can enquire in what proportions and amounts these should be represented in our diet.</p>
<p>The standard daily dietary that is most frequently cited, and which, perhaps, best represents the food consumption of the average European workman in towns, is that proposed by Prof. Voit. This dietary was made upon the basis of a large number of observed cases. It demands for a man of average size, engaged in average manual labor,</p>

<p>Now it is the opinion of all competent judges, that 
<pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=23"/>
at least one third of this proteid should come from the animal kingdom, and this one third, if given in the form of fresh beef, would be represented by 230 grams of butcher's meat, calculated to consist of</p>

<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=24"/>
<p>We will give an instance of how much below these figures the amount consumed sometimes falls.</p>
<p>Prof. Boehm found that a poor North German family, consisting of a man, wife, and a child five years old, had in one week for their food:</p>
<table columns="3">
<row>
<cell>Potatoes,</cell>
<cell>.....</cell>

</row>

<cell></cell>
<cell></cell>
</row></table>
<p>Calculating the food principles contained in these amounts, we find that the three individuals daily consumed of:</p>
<table columns="3">
<row>
<cell align="center">Proteids,</cell>
<cell align="center">Fats,</cell>

</row>

<cell align="center">41 gms.</cell>
<cell align="center">1251 gms.</cell>
</row></table>
<p>It needs no comment to show how insufficient is this dietary in amount, and how incorrect in proportion.</p>
<p>We have selected Prof. Atwater's dietary for a man at moderate manual labor as the basis of our twelve bills of fare and have taken Voit's standard for women and children.</p>
<p>Our climate is more trying and our people work faster, and we shall do well to allow more fat and meat to our working-man than the foreign dietaries provide. If our man is to get daily one-third of his proteid in the form of animal food, this would be represented by 8 ozs. of butcher's meat (without bone), by from 5 to 5.8 ozs. cheese, or by 8 eggs.</p>
<pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=25"/>
<p>We believe that it is better to go a little high rather than too low with proteid food. As a rule, people who eat enough proteids, and especially enough animal food, are vigorous and have what we call "stamina," and doctors incline to the belief that such people resist disease better because their blood and tissue are less watery than in the case of people who draw their proteids almost entirely from such vegetables as potatoes. But many workingmen in America would be surprised to learn how well health and strength can be maintained on what is, after all, not such a very large amount of meat, provided the rest of the dietary contains enough vegetable proteid and fat.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.</hd>
<p>It now remains for us to see whether the economist can get practical help from the foregoing facts about the character of foods and the use that is made of them in the body.</p>
<p>We have seen that we cannot economize in the amount of our food beyond certain limits and yet remain healthy and strong; also that we must not greatly alter the relative proportions in which experience has shown that these foods are best combined. The true field of household economy has, then, certain prescribed limits.</p>
<p>Its scope lies, 1st. In furnishing a certain food principle in its cheap rather than its dear form; for example, the proteid of beef instead of that of chicken, fat of meat instead of butter. 2nd. Having bought foods wisely, in cooking them in such a manner as to bring out their full nutritive value; for
<pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=26"/>
instance, making a roast juicy and delicious instead of dry and tasteless. 3d. In learning how to use every scrap of food to advantage, as in soup making, and 4th, if we add to these the art of so flavoring and varying as to make simple materials relish, we have covered the whole field of the household economist, so far as the food question is concerned.</p>
<p>We hope she will find help in the following pages, for it will be part of our task in this essay to examine different articles of food as to their nutritive value, and to recommend such combinations and such methods of cooking as will make the utmost out of a certain sum of money. As to foods, we have in America a large range of choice; staple raw products cost less generally than they do in Europe and the laboring man here has somewhat more money to buy with. The anxious provider, who must feed many mouths on what seems an insufficient sum, may feel assured that he can, without doubt, learn to do better than he now does. In this line we must not disdain to learn lessons wherever we can.</p>
<p>There is an unfortunate prejudice among us against learning of foreign countries. The American workman says indignantly that he does not want to learn how to live on "starvation wages." But the facts, viewed coolly, are just these: the inhabitants of older countries have learned some lessons that we too must soon learn whether we will or no, and to profit by these lessons before we are really obliged to, will in no way lower wages, it will simply help us to get more comfort and pleasure out of our money.</p>
<p>Students of economy, political and domestic, find
<pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=27"/>
no better school than the experience of older countries, and constantly draw lessons from their greater thrift and economy in living. Mrs. Helen Campbell found, among the poor sewing women of New York, that none were skillful in cooking their scanty food excepting only the German and Swiss women. All observing travelers unanimously give this testimony,--"If our American workman knew how to make as much of his large wage as the foreigner does of his small one, he could live in luxury."</p>
<p>But you ask, what are the special lessons to be learned of the foreign housewife? We answer, chiefly self-denial and saving. Do not give up in despair because you have a small income and resign yourself to living meanly, in a hand to mouth fashion. Diligent study of the question and resolute abstention from luxuries will solve the problem, if it can be solved.</p>
<p>We indulge ourselves and our children too much in what tastes good, while all the time we know we have not money enough to buy necessaries. For instance, the consumption of sugar in America was in 1887, 56 lbs. per head, in Germany hardly more than one third that amount. This means a larger consumption of sweetmeats than we can afford and at the same time be well fed otherwise.</p>
<p>We seem, in general, to spend too much money in our country on food compared with what we use in other directions; one great trouble is that we do not know how to save every scrap of food and use it again in some form. For one thing, we have yet to learn the great art of soup making,--and it seems also, of soup eating.</p>
<pb n="16" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=28"/>
<p>The American housekeeper would say to me: "This is nothing new, for years we've been hearing about soups. We don't like soups!" I only ask, "have you tried them for a considerable length of time, so that you have become skilled in making them, and your family used to their taste?" One fact alone ought to insure for them a good trial; that at least three nations, the French, German and Italian, make daily use of them and have for generations. To take part of our food in this form is an absolute necessity if we are to do the best possible with a certain amount of money.</p>
</subdiv>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES.</hd>
<p>The practical difficulties in the way of improvement in household cookery are not small. As cook, we have the wife and mother, who has too little time for this very important branch of household work; she has had, perhaps, no good training in the art of cookery (for it is an art), and besides, her kitchen and kitchen utensils are not at all what they should be. Indeed, the qualifications for a given task could not well be further from the ideal.</p>
<p>In Europe families of small means have many helps unknown to us. In the first place, bread is never baked at home, the bakers' bread being both excellent and cheap. It would seem that among us, bakers' bread must shortly improve in quality and decrease in price; either the profits must be too large, or the business not well managed. For instance, in those parts of Germany where white bread is eaten as a staple, it costs a trifle over 3
<pb n="17" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=29"/>
cents a pound, while flour of average quality costs about the same. In contrast with this, compare the prices of bread and flour in our own country where in no large city is bread quoted at less than 7 cents, while flour costs 3 cents. That is, bread costs in Germany about the same as flour and in America more than twice as much; and yet the German baker is notably a prosperous person!</p>
<p>The foreign housekeeper has still further help from the baker. If she makes a cake or pie, she sends it out to be baked, and pays from one to two cents (the fuel would have cost more); joints of meat and mixed dishes are also sent to be baked for the same price; and before any bakeshop in a German city, at noon on Sunday, can be seen a line of servant girls, each in turn receiving a steaming dish as it is taken from the oven. The soup kitchens (<emph rend="italic">Volks K&#251;chen</emph>) of various grades are also a great help. The writer has repeatedly had brought from one of them an excellent meat broth (1 pt. for 2 cents), and good cooked vegetables are furnished for a price less than they could be cooked for at home, if one took any account of time and fire.</p>
<p>But such helps are not yet to any great extent available to the American woman; she must wrestle with her own problem at home and solve it as best she can.</p>

<hd align="center">THE KITCHEN.</hd>
<p>The kitchen of a woman of average means is not the ideal kitchen. It is perhaps too small or not light enough, or it may have still more serious defects, as a bad drain. We must take it as it is, however, requiring only that it contain what is necessary to the end we have in view,--plain cooking for a family of six.</p>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Size of Kitchen.</hd>
<p>In the cheaper city dwellings the kitchen is small, too small for good ventilation, and for the heavier kinds of work as washing; but for cooking, a very small kitchen can be so arranged as to answer every purpose.</p>
<p>Any one who has seen a ship's kitchen can understand this. The cook as he stands before his range is within reach of all his stores, for rows of drawers and shelves literally line the walls from floor to ceiling, little tables for pastry or cake making are drawn out of the wall and pushed in again when not wanted, and every inch of floor and wall space is used to the best advantage. This cook would tell you that he did not want a larger kitchen; he would only lose time running about in it.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Arrangement.</hd>
<p>Begin to utilize the wall space. If you have not yet as many shelves as the walls will accommodate, put up more, and especially
<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=31"/>
about and above the stove, so that as you stand at your cooking you can reach salt, pepper and every other flavor that can be used in a soup or stew; cooking spoons and forks and knives, potlids and holders--all these should be at your hand. Let a carpenter fasten into the mortared wall strips of wood that will hold nails and a few shelves, and if the stove is in a niche with wall on two or even three sides of it, all the better. On these nails should hang nearly every implement used in cooking, and on the shelves should be found all spices and flavors; farther back can be placed what is more seldom used. If there are no drawers, never mind, use close tin boxes for as many things as you can; if no closed cupboard for your dishes, hang a curtain before the open shelves.</p>
<p>The nearer your sink is to the stove the better, that is the path your feet must oftenest travel. There must be a table of some sort very near the stove; if it is a movable one, all the better, or it may be a broad shelf with a very strong and safe hinged support under it, letting down when not in use.</p>
<p>I take for granted that the main part of your work is to be done on this stove and table, and that a well stocked pantry, fitted out for the making of pastry and cake and elaborate dishes, is not within your reach any more than the time for making such.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Utensils.</hd>
<p>The utensils you need are few, but these few you must have. Consider the value of the food materials that you use; a few burns on an old sauce pan will quite buy a new one. We will speak only of the most important and absolutely necessary utensils.</p>
<pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=32"/>
<p>First, do not use tin; it is cheap, but coal is not, and you will waste a great deal of coal in trying to cook in tin. Brass and copper cooking vessels are to be avoided by one who must economize, as they are expensive and require too much care to keep them free from the poisonous verdigris.</p>
<p>Of chief importance among your utensils is a flat bottomed iron pot with close fitting <emph rend="italic">iron</emph> lid. Get the smoothest and best, even if it cost double. In this you will roast meat with little fire, cook vegetables, all but peas and beans, cook anything indeed that is not acid. Have two of these, if you can, of different sizes. Next, an iron frying pan, also of the smoothest wrought iron and light; this too should have a close fitting cover. Some people consider iron utensils heavy and old fashioned, but where economy is an object, no other ware is so good and satidfactory. The blue or grey enamelled ware is very nice but will not stand great heat and easily chips and cracks, but you should have one kettle of this ware as it is valuable for cooking fruit and anything acid. You must have a wire <implement>gridiron</implement> for toasting bread and broiling meat; this you should use for many things which you now cook in the frying pan. The tea-kettle is a matter of course, and a griddle. There is one other utensil not as common, but which deserves to be, viz., a <implement>steamer;</implement> a simple pot with perforated bottom which will fit tightly into the top of the iron pot, and have a very tightly fitting cover. Its use will be discussed later.</p>
<p>You can hardly do without a number of earthen jugs, glazed with lead-free enamel, especially for
<pb n="21" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=33"/>
cooking and holding milk. Get also a number of wooden spoons; they are cheap and clean, and of convenient shape for stirring. The old fashioned <implement>pudding stick</implement> of the Yankee kitchen is the earliest form among us, and many people know no other.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Stoves.</hd>
<p>A good stove is of first importance in a kitchen, but fortunately good stoves have become common. A graver question, however, is the cost of fuel to be burned in them. Of course coal must be the stand-by, and when the stove is heated up as on ironing and baking days, care can be taken to use the fire to its fullest capacity; in winter, dishes can be cooked ahead for several days.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Coal Oil.</hd>
<p>To cook a single dish or for boiling a tea-kettle a <implement>coal oil stove</implement> is a saving; it is also invaluable for keeping a pot at a simmering heat,--a thing very difficult to accomplish on a stove.</p>
</section>
<section class1="household">
<hd align="center">Charcoal.</hd>
<p>For the same purpose, and for any steady cooking, and aboveall for broiling meat, every housekeeper ought to have appliances for burning charcoal; it only needs a grating with a rim 2 or 3 inches high, to let down into the stove hole (a sort of deep <implement>spider</implement> with a grated bottom). For such purposes, a bushel of hard wood charcoal costing 15 or 20 cents would last a long time. Charcoal is almost the only fuel used in Paris for cooking; indeed, throughout France and in Western Germany it is in very common use.</p>

<hd align="center">PROTEID-CONTAINING FOODS<lb/>AND THEIR PREPARATION.</hd>
<p>We have already in the Introduction called attention to the importance of this food principle. It is well for us to bear in mind that there are three great classes of Proteids, Albumens proper, Caseins, and and Fibrins, and that in both plants and animals are found representatives of these three classes. Thus, in plant juices and in eggs we have things belonging to the Albumen class; in the curd of sour milk and in the legumine of the pod-covered plants we have examples of caseins; and in the gluten of grains and in the clot whipped out of blood we have examples of fibrins.</p>

<p>Our animal foods contain some other things that the housewife ranks with proteids and we have a few words to say about one of them, viz., gelatine, that nitrogenous substance boiled out of bones and cartilage.</p>
<subsection class1="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Gelatine, Hist. of</hd>
<p>In the history of foods this gelatine, like meat extract, has played a great part. Before the real functions of the food principles were understood it was thought that what could be extracted by water from a piece of meat comprised all in it that was of value to the body; and so it happened
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=35"/>
that for more than a hundred years after Papin had discovered the method of extracting all the gelatine out of bones (which he did by the aid of that contrivance still known in kitchens as the "Papin Soup Digester") gelatine was considered to be one of the most, if not the most nourishing constituent of meats. In the last decade of the 18th century, and in the early part of this the French made great use of gelatine under the impression that it was a proteid because it yielded nitrogen to the chemist. Improved methods of extracting it were invented, and so general did its use become, especially in the public institutions of Paris, that from 1829-38, two and three quarters million portions of bone-gelatine soup were dealt out to the inmates of a single hospital. But in spite of the opinions of eminent scientists that gelatine soups and gelatine tablets were a perfect subtitute for proteids, their consumption decreased; physicians again took hold of the subject, and by the middle of the century opinion had so changed that nearly all, if not all, food value was denied to them. Modern experimentation based on more rational methods has put gelatine in its right place. It is a food, just as much so as is fat, but like fat it cannot play r&#244;le of proteid although a certain amount taken with fats and carbohydrates will enable the body to get along with a little less proteid. It is even said by Prof. Voit to excel fat in its ability to do half duty for proteid material.</p>
<p>We have thought it well to speak of this because of a sort of superstitious regard in the kitchen for "stock," a survival, one would think of Papin's time.
<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=36"/>
A good German housewife was wont to discourse to the writer on the economical virtues of a certain "Frau Doctor" who "always boiled her bones three times" and dwellers in many a household have had their nostrils assailed by the smell of glue, during the sixth hour of bone boiling.</p>
<p>But if the importance of gelatine was and is still exaggerated, this is still more true of the other parts of meat that can be extracted by water.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="soups">
<hd align="center">Sol. Albumen and Extractives.</hd>
<p>We have seen that hot water coagulates proteid, and once coagulated, it will not dissolve in water, and for this reason the soup generally contains of this valuable principle only the soluble albumen which rose as scum. If the cook has skimmed this off, the soup which she calls strong is strong with flavors rather than with nutritive priciples.</p>
<p>To show how very little real food a good tasting meat soup may contain, we will give an analysis made by Prof. K&#246;nig.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="soups">
<hd align="center">Analysis of Soup.</hd>
<p>He took 1 lb. of beef and about 6 1/2 oz. of veal bones, and treated them, he says, as is usually done in the kitchen to get a pint of good strong soup or bouillon. This contained</p>

<p>But where are the albumens that were in the meat to begin with? Many of them are still there in that stringy, sodden mass, the "soup meat," which the cook tells us contains no further value. It consists of cooked connective tissue and albumen; now these
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=37"/>
are foods and they must be rescued from the garbage barrel, for with the help of the <implement>chopping knife</implement> and the herb bag we can make them still do proteid duty in our bodies.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="soups">
<hd align="center">Real importance of Soup.</hd>
<p>If we do not overvalue either the gelatine or the flavoring matters in our meat soups, nor throw away the meat out of which they are made, we shall begin to make soups on the right basis, that is an understanding of the real value of the materials we are working with, and we shall use meat for our soups less often than we now do perhaps, considering its high price and our greater need of it cooked in other ways. Soups should not be regarded as a luxury, neither as the last resort of poverty, but as a necessary part of a dinner, just as they are now used by all classes in Europe; but they need not be made of good cuts of meat, nor indeed, of meat at all.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Proteid as we buy it.</hd>
<p>We will now direct our attention to the proteid as we buy it.</p>
<p>We cannot here take up the chemical composition and exact nutritive value of every kind of meat to be bought at the butcher's stall, the fish market and the poultry stand. But we must note a few points of importance.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame" class2="marketing">
<hd align="center">Butchers' meat. Prof. K&#246;nig's Analyses of Meat.</hd>
<p>We know that butchers' meat contains from 50% to 78% of water, according to the quality of the piece and the kind of animal. Most people in buying meat think first of the red part; they may know that it is advantageous to buy meat that is streaked with fat, but they hardly realize how wise it is to do so. As a rule, fat takes the place of water. Let us consult tables of analyses for the
<pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=38"/>
amounts of water, proteids and nitrogenous extractives, fats and salts contained in lean pieces and in pieces streaked with fat. In Prof. K&#246;nig's valuable treatise on Foods we find such analyses, carefully collected and sifted out of a large amount of material; samples of neck, tenderloin, shoulder, hind-quarter and so on, just as bought at the butchers', were analyzed after being freed from adherent <emph rend="italic">lump</emph> fat, and the average composition of all the different cuts was as follows:--</p>

<p>These tables illustrate how wise it is to buy meat from a very fat animal. They show that a pound of meat from a fat ox may have more than 20% less water than a corresponding piece from a lean one; of course such a piece may contain from 3 to 4% less proteid, but to compensate for this, it will have 25% more fat.</p>
<p>Let us give another table which illustrates that pieces like tenderloin are not the richest in proteids and fats, though they do have the finest flavor. It may help to console those whose purses do not allow them to buy these expensive cuts.</p>

<p>In this case the difference between shoulder and tenderloin as to the amount of water contained in each is striking. In the case of <emph rend="italic">medium</emph> fat and lean animals, poor and good pieces approach each other more nearly in composition.</p>
<p>We regret that the scope of this essay will not allow us to give drawings and full illustrations of the different parts of an animal, with advice in detail as to what to buy. We are glad to mention in this connection a former prize essay--"Healthy Homes and Foods for the Working Classes"--which gives much information needed by the housekeeper as to the qualities and comparative value of the meat from different animals, of milk and milk products.</p>

<p>We see that while the water is nearly the same in both, the meat has the advantage in proteids and the eggs the advantage in fat, this fat, moreover, being of very fine quality.</p>
<p>Take eggs at their cheapest, as in April when they often sell at 15 cents a dozen, that would be 12 1/2 cents a pound, 10 eggs of average size weighing a pound. They could then be considered cheaper than the highest priced cuts of meat, but still much dearer than the cheaper parts, flank, neck and brisket, at 8 cents. So that even at this low price, they are somewhat of a luxury to the man who must get his proteid and fat in their cheapest form.</p>
<p>And when we consider that only for a short time in the year is the price so low,--eggs being on an average quoted at 25 to 30 cents, the showing for them as a proteid rival of meat is poor indeed. Except in the Spring the economically inclined must be sparing of their use even in dessert dishes. When housekeepers say, as I have heard them, that eggs at 25 cents a dozen are cheaper than meat, they must be speaking in comparison with very high priced meats.</p>

<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy" class2="marketing">
<hd align="center">Cheese (its food value.)</hd>
<p>In America, cheese is regarded more as a luxury than as a staple article of food, and yet 1 lb. of cheese is equal in food value to more than 2 lbs. of meat, it being very rich in both fat and proteids. Considering this, its price is very low and it ought to be a treasure to the poor man and do good service in replacing sometimes the more expensive meat.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<pb n="30" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=42"/>
<hd align="center">Uses of cheese abroad.</hd>
<p>Its food value is fully recognized abroad. For the Swiss peasant it is a staple second only to bread, while the use of it in Italy and in Germany is extensive. The writer once spent several weeks in the house of a large farmer on the slope of Mt. Pilatus in Switzerland, and observed daily the food given to the harvesters; the luncheon sent twice a day to the fields consisted of a quarter section of the grayish skim cheese, accompanied with bread. I was told that the poor people in the region ate scarcely any meat, using cheese in its stead.</p>
<p>The writer has also observed the use of cheese in Germany. Every locality has its special variety of the soft kind made of sour milk, and great amounts of the Swiss, both skim and full milk, cheese are consumed. It is generally eaten uncooked, but also as an addition to cooked food in a great variety of dishes.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<hd align="center">Digestibility of cheese.</hd>
<p>There is no doubt of the food value of cheese, but there does seem to be some question as to its digestibility. When we come to inquire into this point, we find that thorough experiments have been made by German scientists; Dr. R&#252;bner, a pupil of Voit, gives the result of experiments on himself. He found that he could not consume much of it alone, but with milk he took easily 200 grams, or nearly 1/2 lb., and only when he took as high as 517 grams or over a pound daily, was it less completely digested than meat. Prof. K&#246;nig says that in the amounts in which it is generally eaten, 125 to 250 grams daily (1/4 to 1/2 lb.), it is as well digested as meat or eggs. The extensive use of it abroad would seem to be some guarantee for the digestibility of the foreign varieties at least.</p>
<pb n="31" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=43"/>
<p>American cheeses have in general a sharper flavor than the foreign, still it is probable that well mixed with other food, enough could be taken many a time, to give a man his needed daily quantity of animal proteid,--between six and seven ounces,--and this is a matter of great importance from an economical point of view.</p>

<hd align="center">METHODS OF COOKING MEAT.</hd>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Why cook.</hd>
<p>And first--why do we cook it at all? In the animal as well as in the vegetable world some foods are all ready for our digestion, as milk. Raw eggs too, are perfectly digestible and are often given to invalids. We hear, of "Raw meat cures," and it has been found that tender and juicy raw meat, if chopped fine to break the connective tissue, is well disgested.</p>
<p>But raw meat does not taste good to most of us, while the delicious flavor and odor of a broiled steak make it very acceptable to the palate, and we must believe to the stomach also. We "bring out the flavor," as we say, by cooking; what else do we do?</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Structure of meat.</hd>
<p>Let us examine for a moment a piece of meat with reference to the effect heat has upon it. The red part is made up of, first, very tiny sausage-like bags, or muscle fibres as they are called, and in these is contained the precious proteid matter, flavors and salts all mixed together with water into a sort of jelly; second, these muscle fibres are bound together by strands of connective tissue, as that white stringy mass is called, in which the fat and blood vessels are lodged; this is also of food value, but inferior to the fibres. Third, dissolved in the juices floating between the fibres and strands,
<pb n="33" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=45"/>
there is also a proteid called soluble albumen. The little bags of proteid, when we can get at them, are as digestible in our stomachs as is the white of egg, though, like the egg again, their flavor is improved by slight cooking. But, as we have seen, they are imprisoned in the connective tissue, somewhat, we may say, as are the starch grains of the potato in the cellulose.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Softening connective tissue.</hd>
<p>This connective tissue we can soften by heat, thereby turning it into a sort of gelatine, but unfortunately, unless the meat is very tender, this requires a longer application of heat than is needed to cook the delicate albumen all full of flavors too easily lost. To soften the connective tissue without overcooking the albumen, is one of the problems of meat cookery.</p>
<p>The next question is, how do our methods of cooking meet these requirements?</p>
</section>
<section>
<hd align="center">COOKING MEAT IN WATER.</hd>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">1st Method.</hd>
<p>Put a piece of lean meat into cold water, heat it very slowly and watch the effect. The water becomes slightly red, then cloudy, and as the heat increases, yellowish in color, and finally it clears, sending a scum to the surface. If we examine this scum, we find that the water has soaked out much soluble albumen and a large proportion of the salts of the meat as well as other substantives called extractives; and now the odor of the boiling meat begins to fill the kitchen. The longer and slower the warming process, the more of all these things we shall extract, and the meat when taken out will be in just that proportion poor.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="soups" class2="meatfishgame">
<pb n="34" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=46"/>
<hd align="center">Soup making.</hd>
<p>This is the process known as soup making,--very simple, if we care nothing for the piece of meat but to soak out of it all the food and flavors possible. After some hours of cooking we find it shrunken, gray and tasteless. A dog if fed on that alone could not live many days. However, as we have before said, we are not to conclude, that it contains no more nutriment, but the stomach rejects it now that it is separated from all the flavoring matters.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<p>2nd Method.</p>
<p>Now put a piece of meat into boiling water and continue the boiling. The surface of the meat suddenly whitens and a little scum rises on the water, though very little compared with what we saw in the former method. We have coagulated the albumen contained in all the little cells in the surface of the meat, and the soluble albumen, flavoring matters and salts cannot get out; the sealing up is not quite perfect, enough escaping into the water to make it a weak soup, but it is a good method of cooking a large piece if properly completed from this point. But if we <emph rend="italic">go on</emph> boiling our meat, that is, keeping the temperature at 212&#176;, we shall overcook the albumen in the outer layers before that in the center is coagulated. By overcooking, we mean making it horny and flavorless, as we do the white of an egg if we cook it in the old-fashioned way, by dropping into boiling water and keeping it at that heat. Having seared the outside of the meat to keep the juices in, we must lower the temperature. The albumen coagulates at between 160&#176; and 170&#176;, but the water in the kettle may be a little above this, as
<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=47"/>
it must constantly transfer heat to the interior of the meat. The general rule is that it should "bubble" or "simmer" only, and if the cook can do no better she must follow these indications. That the true temperature for cooking meat is below the boiling point, many an intelligent housekeeper knows, but how is she to know when the water is at 170&#176;? Here we come upon the weakest point in household cookery; various degrees of heat have different effects on the foods we cook, but of only one temperature is the housekeeper certain--that of boiling water.</p>
<p>For the use of the thermometer and the heat saver see <ref target="prac055.gif">pages 43 and 44.</ref></p>
<p>But to return; is these no way of cooking that will keep in the meat all these flavors and salts and albumens, just as nature mixed them? Yes, there are three ways,--frying in fat, baking in an oven, and broiling over coals.</p>
</subsection>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Frying in fat.</hd>
<p>We will examine the first. If we plunge a thin piece of meat, as a cutlet coated with egg and breadcrumbs, into boiling fat, the albumen in the surface or rather in that of the egg surrounding it is coagulated as in boiling, but this time the outer rind preserves the juices still better because the fat will not mix with them as will water. Everyone knows how an oyster cooked in this way retains its juices.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Baking meat.</hd>
<p>When we bake a piece of meat in the oven, we start in the same way; we sear the outside in fat, turning the roast about in a small quantity of fat made hot in a kettle; we then transfer it, still in the kettle or pan, to a hot oven
<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=48"/>
where the process of cooking is completed, but at short intervals we moisten the surface with the fat in the pan. If we did not baste the roast, we would find a thick layer of grey, tasteless meat inside the outer brown crust, and indeed the whole piece would dry long before the center of our roast had reached the coagulating point; we baste, in order to keep in the juices which, as we know, will not mix with the fat, and also that only a mild degree of heat, not exceeding the coagulating point of proteids, may be transmitted to the interior. In the intervals of our basting, some water is driven out of the meat and evaporated into steam, and the high heat of the oven expends itself in evaporating this, in heating the basting fat, and perhaps (if it reach so high a temperature) in decomposing part of it, and in changing the chemical character of small quantities of extractives, thus making the meat "tasty," and so it happens that only a mild degree of heat is passed into the center of the piece. We would hardly believe that the inside of a roast, with its light pink color, registers only 160&#176; by the thermometer, yet this can be proved by anyone with a long chemist's thermometer.</p>
<p>Although some of the water of our meat has evaporated, the extractives and salts are retained to a larger extent than in boiling, as we shall see by the table given later.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Broiling.</hd>
<p>In broiling, the principle applied is exactly the same as in baking, the cooking being done by the medium of heated air. The dry heat of the coals affects the outer layer of
<pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=49"/>
the meat, as does the hot air of the oven. In both these methods, just as in boiling, we try to hold the temperature of our cooking medium just high enough to keep the heat traveling toward the interior of the meat.</p>
</section>
<p>We have now learned to cook the albumen enough and not too much and to keep the flavors of our meat; what about the connective tissue, and how has that fared with our different modes of cooking?</p>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Tender meat.</hd>
<p>If our meat is cut from the tenderer parts of an animal of the right age, well fed and fattened, and if it has been kept long enough after killing, the connective tissue will soften into eatable condition in the length of time required to cook the albumen by the methods described. Such meat, so cooked, will always be tender and full of flavor.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Tough Meat.</hd>
<p>But if the meat is cut from the tougher parts, or from an old or ill-fattened animal, or cooked too soon after killing, the connective tissue will not soften in that time; we must continue the application of heat till this tissue softens.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Methods compared: 1st, as to quality of meat.</hd>
<p>Therefore, what method of cooking we shall use, depends on the quality of the meat we have. Trimmings and tough portions we will make into soup, expecting to chop the tasteless meat next day and add other flavors to make it palatable. Somewhat better pieces, but still requiring long cooking to soften the connective tissue, may be made into a stew or ragout; or if the piece is large and compact, boiled in water; but meat
<pb n="38" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=50"/>
that is tender and juicy (and for improving tough meat see <ref target="prac057.gif">page 45</ref>) should be boiled, baked or broiled, choosing oftenest the last two methods, because of the more perfect retention of the juices and the fine flavor given to the outer layer.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">2d, as to economy.</hd>
<p>We are told that baking or broiling is a very wasteful way of cooking meat; that if we would be truly economical we would always boil or stew, using our meat or its juices to flavor vegetables. From this we must dissent for it would condemn us to such a monotony as would be unendurable even to the poor. Better sometimes a smaller piece of broiled or baked meat with its delicious and stimulating flavor, and make our soup of vegetables and season it with herbs. Besides, according to the scientists, baking and broiling are <emph rend="italic">not</emph> wasteful methods. I quote from a table of Prof. K&#246;nig's, wherein are given the results of analysis of beef raw, after boiling and after <emph rend="italic">"braten."</emph> Raw, it contained .86% extractives (nitrogenous bodies mostly; very important as giving the stimulating smell and taste) and 1.23% salts.</p>

<p>The advantage is seen to be in favor of <emph rend="italic">"braten"</emph>both in regard to extractives and salts. The loss of water was nearly the same in both cases. As for the fat lost in broiling a beef steak, that is indeed a loss, but one to be made up in some measure by the smaller quantity of fuel necessary to cook the meat. The
<pb n="39" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=51"/>
loss of this fat need not be made so much of, until we have learned to do better in many other still more important directions.</p>
<p>The philosophy of cooking meat according to the different methods has been treated, and we will not give a few additional directions as to carrying out these methods.</p>

<p>Keep a kettle, if possible, for this purpose alone, and add to it all bits of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and <ingredient>bones</ingredient> as they accumulate.

<p align="center">Skimming.</p>
<p>Do not remove the scum; it contains the albumen of the soup, and nothing objectionable if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> was well cleaned.</p>
<p>An hour before the soup is served add flavors; <ingredient>onions</ingredient> and <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> are the best, <ingredient>celery,</ingredient> <ingredient>summer savory,</ingredient> and <ingredient>parsley</ingredient> next. Use others, as <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> <ingredient>nutmeg,</ingredient> <ingredient>bay leaf,</ingredient> etc., only occasionally. Add <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> just before serving.</p>
<p>When done, strain and skim off all fat (better if

<p>[We prefer our soups with the fat removed, but the laboring people of Europe with their hardy stomachs find a soup much better if covered with "eyes."]</p>

But when fuel is expensive, or in the summer when a hot fire is a nuisance, the perfectly cooked <ingredient>meat</ingredient> can also be obtained by broiling; the management of the fire is the only trouble. We are told that a <ingredient>beefsteak</ingredient> for broiling should be cut 3/4 of an inch thick, and put over a hot fire of coal or charcoal; quite right, but when it has browned quickly, as it should, and been turned and browned on the other side, it yet remains raw in the middle and if left longer, the surface burns. This is the experience of the novice, who has yet to learn two things; first, that immediately after the first browning, the fire must decrease in heat, or the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> be brought further away, so that the <ingredient>steak</ingredient> may cook 10-12 minutes without burning--less time will not cook it nicely in the middle; and second, that like baked <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> the surface must be kept moist with <ingredient>hot

<p>Professional cooks always use charcoal for broiling, and its advantages are great.

<p>To cook meat at a temperature of between 150&#176; and 160&#176; F., is no easy matter with the usual kitchen appliances. Even over an easily regulated <implement>heater,</implement> as a gas or coal oil flame, how are we to know that temperature when it is reached? The writer, knowing of no thermometer arranged for use in a kitchen, constructed a simple one after the model of those used in laboratories. A thermometer tube registering 300&#176; Celsuis was simply fastened into a cork, the bulb projecting below and protected by a short cylinder of wood. This floated on the water and made it easy to cook at any given temperature. This thermometer was also hung in a light wire frame and used for testing the heat of an oven.</p>

<hd align="center">THE HEAT SAVER.</hd>
<p>It is a part of common information that the inhabitants of northern countries make extensive use of non-conducting substances, like wool, for preventing the escape of heat from a vessel in which cooking is going on. It is strange that we do not make more use of such appliances, for they have often been described and illustrated; it is probably because they are not found ready-made, and with a complete list of directions for use. The writer made and used a cooker of this sort, and after considerable modification and experiment it became a very useful thing in the kitchen. If you wish to cook meat at the proper temperature, this contrivance makes it possible to do so, and is also very saving of fuel.</p>
<formula class="household">

Take a <ingredient>packing box</ingredient> measuring, say, 2 feet each way and cover the bottom with a layer of <ingredient>packed wool</ingredient> 4 to 6 inches thick; set into the middle of this another box or a <ingredient>cylinder of sheet iron</ingredient> and fill the space between the two with a layer of wool, 4 to 6 inches thick and closely packed. Into the inner compartment put your kettle of meat or vegetables already brought to the boiling point and having a tightly fitting cover, and over this press a <ingredient>thick pillow</ingredient> or <ingredient>woolen blanket.</ingredient> Then fasten down tight over all, the lid of your box. As the heat in the water must finish the cooking already begun, its amount must be rightly proportioned to the amount of food to be cooked, <emph rend="italic">e. g.,</emph> two quarts of water to 1 1/2 lbs. beef rib, were used.

<hd align="center">TO MAKE MEAT TENDER.</hd>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">To make meat tender.</hd>
<p>It is well known that meat must be kept some time after killing to make it tender. In winter, a large piece of beef or mutton will keep for six weeks if hung in a dry, cool place. Indeed, this is the time allowed in England for the Christmas "shoulder of mutton," and every few days it is rubbed over with salt and vinegar. In summer, unless the butcher will keep the meat for you, you must resort to other means.</p>
<p>A tough piece of meat may be laid in not too strong vinegar for 3 or 4 days in summer and twice as long in winter, adding to the vinegar such spices as you may like. To soften a tough steak pour a few spoonfuls of vinegar on and let stand for twelve or twenty-four hours. This method has been long recommended and is to some extent used among us; the foreign cook employs sour milk for the same purpose and with even greater success, but this must be changed every day and at the end of the time well washed from the meat.</p>
<p>We cannot too strongly urge that the housekeeper, especially if she be straightened in means, should become used to these methods and practice them occasionally. She does not want to confine herself to soups and stews and she cannot buy "porter-house" steak at 20 or 25 cents a pound, but she can buy "round" at half that price, and after a little experiment can make it tender for boiling, roasting or broiling by one of these methods. In winter, she should buy a supply of meat ahead and keep it until it grows tender.</p>

<hd align="center">Mutton and Lamb.</hd>
<p>The quality of mutton is so varying that when cooked the dish is often a disappointment. The influence of long keeping or "hanging" upon it is even more beneficial than upon beef.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Mutton Fat.</hd>
<p><emph rend="italic">Fat of Mutton.</emph> Some cooks trim away every bit of fat from mutton. It is perfectly wholesome, but sometimes gets a taste from coming in contact with the hide or hair of the animal; hence the prejudice. Scrape the outside of the meat well, pulling off the dried skin and cutting away the dark ends.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Pieces to roast.</hd>
<p>Unlike beef, other pieces besides the rib are good for roasting; the loin and haunch are most economical, the shoulder next, the leg next. Roast like beef, see <ref target="prac047.gif">page 35.</ref></p>
<p>Unless the meat is first class, do not roast, but boil it. The leg is oftenest used for this purpose.</p>
</subsection>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">To boil mutton.</purpose>

Simmer about 12 minutes to the pound; that is the rule, but very frequently the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> when it comes on the table, will be tough, owing entirely to the difference in the quality of the meat. Such meat must be boiled twice as long, or is better cooked in a stew.</p>

<hd align="center">PORK.</hd>
<p>Pork does not need to be kept in order to be tender, that is one of its great recommendations to the housekeeper. It is also easily cooked and we may lay aside some of the precautions we use regarding beef: The lean of fresh pork however, is apt to dry in cooking.</p>
<subsection class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Roasting pieces.</hd>
<p>The leg, the loin and the chine are good roasting pieces as well as the rib. Pork is so rich in flavor that it seasons finely a bread crumb dressing, to which add a little sage and vinegar or chopped pickles. Bake separately, and lay around it when served. Or better, though more trouble, make holes in the roast and force the stuffing in.</p>
<p>Put directly into a hot oven in a pan containing some hot fat, and baste very frequently till done. Allow at least 20 minutes to the pound.</p>

<p>The importance of eggs is to be estimated from various points of view; their food value is great, their digestibility when fresh is almost perfect, and they can be cooked in so many ways and are a necessary ingredient of so many dishes, that the cook could ill spare them. Indeed, in all countries, their consumption seems to be limited only by their price.</p>

<p>After the first twenty-four hours an egg steadily deteriorates. Physicians say, "never give to an invalid an egg that is more than two or three days old."</p>
<p>There are methods in use for preserving eggs fresh, on the principle of excluding air by sealing up the pores of the shell, but none of them are without risk and they cannot be recommended to one who must economize closely. It is better to go without eggs as nearly as possible in winter.</p>

<hd align="center">MILK.</hd>
<p>Milk is sometimes called the one perfect food, containing all the constituents in their right proportions. This is true only for the requirements of a baby, but it remains for any age a valuable food when rightly supplemented.</p>
<p>Milk contains on the average 3.31% proteids, 3.66% fat, 4.9% carbohydrates, 87.41% water, and .70% salts.</p>
<p>The housewife, if she wishes to use milk with economy, will not in cooking use it <emph rend="italic">as such,</emph> but with due regard to the different values of the cream and the skim parts. In cities skim milk is sold for about one-half the price of full milk, and is well worth it if pure, but it is too often mixed with water.</p>
<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<hd align="center">Boiling Milk.</hd>
<p>As soon as milk comes into the house it should be boiled, as it is a notorious carrier of disease germs which only in this way can be killed. Use an earthenware pitcher and let the milk remain standing in the same after cooking. The next day remove the cream for the morning's coffee, and use the skim part during the day for cooking, with or without the addition of a little butter.</p>

<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<hd align="center">Keeping Milk.</hd>
<p>To keep milk sweet in warm weather is a serious question to the housekeeper who has no cellar or refrigerator. It is of first importance that the vessels used to contain it should be
<pb n="64" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=76"/>
scrupulously clean. Boiling, as above mentioned, and cooling it rapidly afterwards, will keep it sweet for 24 hours, unless the weather is very warm, and the time may be further extended by keeping the milk pitcher set in a dish of cold water. A quarter of a teaspoonful of baking soda to a quart of milk, added while it is still sweet, may be used in case of necessity but this is not to be commended for common use.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="eggscheesedairy">
<hd align="center">Canning Milk.</hd>
<p>A method that the writer has employed is this: simply canning the milk as one would can fruit.

<hd align="center">FATS AND OILS.</hd>
<p>The third food principle, Fats, stands between the two great nutrients, Proteids on the one hand and Carbohydrates on the other, and we find that we can indulge in considerable latitude as to its use. When we wish to get our food in a more condensed form, we can use fats freely in connection with proteids and lessen the amount of carbohydrates. In army dietaries the amount of fat is largely increased for marching, and for great exertion the quantity becomes three times that allowed in garrison life. For instance, the daily rations served out to the German soldiers in France during the month of August, 1870, contained</p>
<table columns="3">

<p>It was represented by 1 lb. 10 oz. of bread, about 1 1/8 lbs. of meat, and over 1/2 lb. of bacon besides an allowance of coffee, tobacco and wine or beer. Prof. Ranke has called this an admirable diet for fighting men. In garrison life these soldiers would have received only 56 grams of fat, and 120 grams of proteids while the carbohydrates would have been increased to 500 grams or more.</p>
<section class1="generalfood">
<hd align="center">Diet of Bavarian Woodchopper.</hd>
<p>On the other hand, fat when coupled with enough carbohydrate food can replace some of the proteid, and often does so in the food of hardy and economical 
<pb n="67" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=79"/>
people. The Bavarian woodchopper is enabled by his splendid digestion to arrange his diet in the following way: he takes little proteid from the animal kingdom, but in order to get enough of it from vegetable products, he must, as we know, take in an immense quantity of the starch associated with it, and to this he adds a great quantity of fat. Von Liebig says that such a man takes on the average</p>

<p>We see therefore that we can have a sliding scale for fat; that while we should not go below 2 oz. a day, we may, in case we lower one or both of the other two great constituents, go up to 8 or 9 oz.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame">
<hd align="center">Importance of Fat not realized.</hd>
<p>People belonging to the well-to-do classes, unless they have given special study to the subject, seldom realize the importance of fat in our economy. Fat means to them fat meat, suet, lard and the like, and the much eating of these is considered proof of a gross appetite; they do not consider how much fat they take in eggs, in milk, in grains like oatmeal and maize, in the seasoning of their varied dishes, and in their well-fattened meats, where, as in an average piece from a very fat mutton, they eat twice as much fat as proteid without knowing it.</p>
<p>Indeed, a well fed man of the upper classes may have more fat in his daily diet than has the freshly arrived Mechlenburg laborer who spreads a quarter inch layer of lard on his bread. The latter cannot take his fat in unsuspected forms; he craves this
<pb n="68" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=80"/>
principle with his plain vegetable diet, and must take it as he can get it.</p>
<p>Now let us understand that where economy is to be considered, this question of fat does not take care of itself as it does for the rich man. The economical housewife should always keep in mind that she must furnish her family enough fat, and furnish it cheaply.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Substitutes for Butter.</hd>
<p>Butter is a dear fat; count out the water in it and see what it costs you. We must economize in butter in as many ways as possible. We must eat more fat meat, first, that which is ingrained with the lean where it takes the place of water, as we have seen under "Proteids," costing us practically nothing; when we eat our vegetables seasoned with such a piece of meat, we find them sufficiently seasoned. We must also eat more of fat meat which we recognize as such, taking pains to cook it so that it will be palatable; the crisp, brown outside of a roast is always welcome, but the fat of boiled beef or mutton will also be relished if served very hot. An excellent selection in low-priced beef, is the fat middle rib; the lean part is very tender and juicy when cooked in water at a low temperature for two or three hours (or in Heat Saver, see <ref target="prac056.gif">page 44</ref>, for three or four hours) and the fat, if served hot, any but a pampered taste will relish. Too much cannot be said in praise of pork as furnishing a good tasting and cheap fat; it can be cooked in many ways and used to flavor vegetables, etc.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Digestibilty of Fat.</hd>
<p>It is consoling to the economist to know that little of this food principle will be wasted in the body. Fat is more completely
<pb n="69" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=81"/>
absorbed, according to the testimony of the experimenters, than any other kind of food, even meat.</p>
<p>We want to say a few words as to the character of different animal fats, and then we are done with this subject.</p>
<p>All the fats consumed by us, without exception, are composed of three bodies called neutral fats, mixed together in varying proportions. These three bodies are "olcin," "palmatin" (margarin), and "stearin," and the chief difference between them is that they melt at different temperatures; the more olein a fat has, the more easily it melts, and the less it has, the more it is like tallow. In vegetable oils, we find in addition to these, small quantities of what are called "fatty acids," and in butter we have beside the three common fats, a small per cent of four scarcer ones.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Fats compared.</hd>
<p>Practically therefore, all fats are alike, and when absorbed they do the same work in the body, their varying flavors and their colors having nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>However, their flavor, their appearance and the ease with which they melt in the mouth and in the digestive tract have much to do with our estimation of them as foods. Mutton fat will do our body the same service as butter, but because of the relatively small amount of olein it contains, we have difficulty in swallowing it.</p>
<p>As to the comparative digestibility of these fats, it is generally admitted that those which melt at a low temperature, like butter and vegetable oils, are most
<pb n="70" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=82"/>
readily taken up by the system; it is thought that we could digest beeswax if it would melt in the stomach. Still, although butter stands in common estimation as the most digestible, as it is the most palatable of the fats, the stomach finds no trouble in disposing of reasonable amounts of any fat used in the household.</p>
</section>
<section class1="meatfishgame" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Artificial Butter.</hd>
<p>The fact that all fats are so similar in composition, and that, if once digested, they will do the same service in the body, first led scientists to try to make out of the cheaper fats a substitute for butter. It was Napoleon III who se the chemist M&#232;ge-Mourier at work to discovera n artificial butter for use in the army. This chemist added butter color and flavors made in the laboratory, to olein and margarin extracted from beef suet, and mixed with this a little real butter, and so successful was the result, that the making of artificial butter has become a great industry. Now certainly no one objects to artificial butter on the ground that it is made of animal fats, for he eats these every day on his table; he objects because he has doubts as to the cleanliness or the healthfulness of its method of manufacture.</p>
<p>Therefore since the substitution, to some extent, of animal fats for butter is from an economic standpoint so desirable, if we cannot bring ourselves to use oleomargarine we must do the best we can in these kitchen laboratories of ours to make other fats than butter acceptable to the taste.</p>

<p>Beef suet has many uses. It should be bought perfectly fresh, that surrounding the kidneys being chosen as of the best quality. Chopped fine, it is used in suet puddings, and may be employed to enrich other puddings made of skim milk, as a rice pudding; it combines well with bread crumbs in any hot dish, in bread puddings, bread stuffing, bread omelet and soup balls. In all cases it must be chopped fine and cooked sufficiently to fully incorporate it with the other materials. Suet may also be used in many flour dishes instead of butter, if they are only cooked long enough and eaten warm, also in all cake where molasses and spices or any strong flavor is used.</p>

<hd align="center">CARBOHYDRATE-CONTAINING FOODS AND THEIR PREPARATION.</hd>
<p>We are now to furnish for the body the third great food principle, the carbohydrates. These we mean when we speak of the starches and sugars, and with unimportant exceptions, they are furnished by the vegetable world only.</p>
<section class1="breadsweets" class2="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Cellulose.</hd>
<p>As we have seen, that troublesome body, cellulose, plays here a large r&#244;le. It is the skeleton, so to speak, of plants, built by them out of sugar and starch; the chemist finds no difficulty in his laboratory in turning it back into dextrin and sugar, and our stomachs too can digest a large part of the cellulose of very young and tender plants,--from 47% to 62% it has been found, of young lettuce, celery, cabbage and carrots,--but in older plants, the cellulose proper becomes all intergrown and encrusted with substances of a woody and mineral nature, from which even the chemist separates it with the greatest difficulty, while our digestive juices are entirely unequal to the task. Therefore it is that the whole art of the cook is needed in treating this substance; she must soften it, she must break it up, and in many cases separate it as completely as possible from the sugars, starches and proteids which it hinders us from appropriating to our use.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets" class2="fruitvegbeans">
<pb n="76" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=88"/>
<hd align="center">Its use.</hd>
<p>In some cases, as in oatmeal and graham flour, we leave the cellulose because of its mechanical action on the bowels. To be sure, this is a wasteful process, for the cellulose carries with it when it leaves the body considerable undigested food, but better this waste than to give the muscles of our intestines so little work to do that they become unable to digest any but fine, condensed foods.</p>
<p>As a rule, however, we must think of cellulose not as a food at all, but as a tough, foreign body which we must reckon with before we can utilize the proteid and starch particles of many important vegetable foods.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets" class2="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Amount of Carbohydrate.</hd>
<p>The carbohydrates, especially the starches, are the cheapest of the food constituents and therefore most apt to be in excess, especially in the food of the poor. According to estimates already given, an adult at average hard work gets along nicely with 1 1/8 lbs. of carbohydrate material (meaning, of course, the dry amount of this one principle), though fortunately, as mentioned under "Fats," it is found that some of this large amount can be exchanged for fat, if the body, for any reason can better use the latter. Brainworkers and the richer classes the world over take less of carbohydrates, at least in their starch form, and more proteids and fats.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as we get these carbohydrates from the vegetable kingdom, and because the housewife must furnish them combined with other principles as in bread and other things made of flour, and in various dishes in which vegetables are combined with meat,
<pb n="77" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=89"/>
milk, eggs, etc., we will cease speaking of carbohydrates as such, and will give a few hints as to how to prepare vegetable foods so that we can get the most out of them, bearing in mind, however, what has been said about not following out this principle to the extent of weakening the bowels.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets" class2="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">To what extent digested.</hd>
<p>This leads us, first, to examine the general digestibility of the whole class of vegetable foods; meaning by this, not the rapidity nor the ease, but the <emph rend="italic">extent</emph> to which the nutritive principle is yielded up to us. It has been found that, as usually prepared, vegetable foods give up to us from 1/4 to 1/2 less of their nutrients than do animal foods, and especially is this true of those that are rich in proteids. To illustrate: a workman eats as part of his dinner a dish of boiled beans, but though he rightly considers that he has been eating a nourishing dish, he has really absorbed only 60% of the nitrogenous substances contained in it, the other 40% passing from him unused because of its intimate connection with the cellulose; at least this was the case with Prof. Str&#252;mpell who records the result of personal experiments on the digestibility of beans cooked whole. Now this workman digested of the meat part of his dinner 97 1/2%, and this comparison shows how the tougher kinds of cellulose interfere with the absorption of the food matters which they enclose.</p>
<p>The starch part of vegetable food we seem to get out much better than the proteid part, even with our ordinary methods of cooking; thus out of cooked rice we get almost 99% of the starch, but only 80% of what proteid it contains; flour in the form of noodles
<pb n="78" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=90"/>
and macaroni yields up 98 1/2% of its starch and 80% of its albumen,--in the form of bread a little less of each. The potato will give us only 75% of what little proteid it contains, but as high as 92.5% of its starch.</p>
</section>
<section class1="breadsweets" class2="fruitvegbeans">
<hd>Effect of too much starch in the diet.</hd>
<p>Although the starch-containing foods are cheap and although they yield up a good per cent of this nutritive principle, they must not be used to excess for the following reason. Starch must first be turned into sugar by our digestive juices before it can be taken up into the blood,and if the stomach is given more at a time than it can master, certain fermentations may take place, and digestion be influenced. The best authorities say that without doubt the continued and severe diarrheas of small children are due to the fermentation of starch foods for which their digestive organs are not yet ready.</p>
<p>These fermentations, the irritating action on the bowels of too much cellulose, and the loss of a good deal of proteid substance connected with it form the shady side of a vegetable diet. Even the ox with his many stomachs gets out of grass and unchopped hay only 60% of the proteid and 50% of the fat contained in it.</p>

<p>Even in our part of the world two thirds of the proteid food of most people is taken from the vegetable kingdom, and in order to choose our food profitably, we must know where to look for vegetable proteids, and how to fit them for eating. Here the cereals and the legumes are our friends, the former furnishing from 7 to 14% in their dried state, the latter
<pb n="79" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=91"/>
giving the astonishing figure of 20 to 24%; or as much as meat.</p>

<section class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">GRAINS.</hd>
<p>The cereals or grains, though containing much less proteid than the legumes, are more valuable to us because of their excellent taste, their availability to the cook and the readiness with which when ground they yield us their nutrients.</p>
<p>Since the grains are such important foods, a table is appended showing the average richness in food principles of those in common use among us. We find that different analyses of the same grain differ greatly from one other, barley for instance, ranging from 8 to 18% in its proteid, and this may account for a certain grain being popular in one country and not in another.</p>
<subsection class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">Wheat and Indian Corn. Oats. Rice.</hd>
<p>In our country we are especially fortunate in the cheapness and excellence of at least two of the grains, Wheat and Indian Corn. The first has of course much higher food value, but the latter is so cheap and can be so easily cooked that it is a blessing to the poor. The large per cent of both proteids and fat in oats is to be noted, justifyig as it does, the high esteem in which they are now held among us. At the other extreme is rice, the poorest of the grains in both these principles, but its almost perfect digestibility renders it very useful.</p>

<hd align="center">SUGARS.</hd>
<p>Most people would class sugar among the luxuries, and indeed we are best acquainted with it in those combinations with fruit, eggs, butter, and various flavoring matters, which, as puddings, pies, cakes, custards, etc., make up our dessert list.</p>
<subsection class1="breadsweets" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Food Value.</hd>
<p>Our first concern, however, is with its food value. It gives us the high figure of 99% of the third food principle,--Carbohydrates. That is, it must be put in the list with bread and it can be used to a certain extent instead of bread and other starch foods. Moreover, it is especially fitted for a food in cases where nourishment is needed immediately, as it is digested or absorbed into the system almost as quickly as water and without taxing the digestive organs, and perhaps on this account is its consumption so great in our country; we live fast, and we want our nutriment in a condensed form.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="breadsweets" class2="accompaniments">
<hd align="center">Its chief value.</hd>
<p>But on account of its cost and because we are able
<pb n="81" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=93"/>
to take only a moderate amount at a time, sugar cannot, to any great extent, take the place of the starches; we are to value it chiefly for the relish it gives to other foods. As a flavor, it is one of the greatest value, but if we prize variety we are certainly accustomed to the taste of sugar in too many dishes, as in rice, custards, and various egg and bread dishes, which the foreigner would sometimes salt instead of sweeten, and eat with his meat instead of at the end of the meal.</p>
<p>We would suggest that when we do use sugar, as in a pudding, for instance, that we use less of it than we are accustomed to do, for in that case we could eat enough of a dish so flavored to make it furnish more of the real substance of a meal.</p>

<hd align="center">BEANS, PEAS AND LENTILS.</hd>
<subsection class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Per cent of Proteids.</hd>
<p>Look again at the remarkable per cent of proteid given by this class of vegetables. Beans and peas, 23%, Lentils, 25%, while beef gives on the average only from 17 to 21%. By people who from choice or necessity live principally on vegetables, the legumes have always been largely used; their consumption is extensive in India, China, and in all of Europe.</p>
<p>To be sure, the <emph rend="italic">quality</emph> of the proteid is not the same as in meat,--it is less stimulating and palatable, and perhaps in other ways inferior, but the proteid needs of the body can be answered by it, and that is a very important item when the question is one of economy.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Digestibility. Cellulose. Bean Flour.</hd>
<p>The impression that dried beans and peas are "hearty" food, fitted for outdoor
<pb n="82" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=94"/>
door workers rather than for less vigorous people or those of sedentary habits, seems justified by the fact that these vegetables contain an unusually large per cent of cellulose of the tougher sort which requires a long continued application of heat to free it from the proteid and starch of the vegetable; indeed, unless it is broken fine or ground into flour, cooking, however long continued, will be insufficient. We have seen that Prof. Str&#252;pell digested only 40% of the proteid of beans cooked in the ordinary way, but when they were ground to flour and baked he digested 91.8%. The fact is, we could cook and eat our wheat whole much more easily than we can our beans, and yet bean flour is not in the market, if we except the "prepared" sort in small, expensive packages. It seems that the best we can do is to cook beans well and sieve them; in that way we free them from the skins at least.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Split Pea.</hd>
<p>The dried and split pea, though as valuable as the bean and already freed from the skin, is not as much used among us; it should be more employed in soups and as a vegetable.</p>
<p>Lentils a few years ago were to be found only in large cities; now they are more easily attainable. Their food value, as we have seen, is still greater than that of beans and peas, but the taste is not as agreeable until one becomes accustomed to it. An economist cannot afford to neglect the legume family.</p>

<p>We in our country need not feel as bitter against
<pb n="83" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=95"/>
the potato as do the scientists of Europe, for we are not obliged to use it to excess, and considering its cheapness and availability it is for us a good vegetable and on these accounts, though it makes a poor enough showing as to food value, we must rank it next to the bean in importance. It has only 2% of proteids, no fat and only 20.7% carbohydrates, and yet since it can be prepared in so many ways and we never tire of its mild flavor, it will doubtless continue to come upon our tables more frequently than any other vegetable. But every day or twice a day, in large amounts, is far too often; indeed those who use it to this extent must be ignorant of its relatively low food value. The quality of the potato is of great importance and none but the best should be used. It should be a mealy variety and perfectly ripe.</p>
</section>
<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">GARDEN VEGETABLES.</hd>
<p>Green vegetables, excepting the pea and bean, are not to be valued chiefly for what we can reckon up in them of proteids, fats and carbohydrates, for the amount is very small. Except in the height of the season they must be looked on as luxuries, but we will buy them as often as we can afford them. In quantities sufficient to flavor soups and stews they can always be afforded, and in this way should be freely used, carrots, celery, parsnips, and tomatoes, for example.</p>

<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">FRUITS.</hd>
<p>Our markets offer us a great variety of fine fruits, and many of them are cheap in their season; apples in the fall are within the reach of the very poorest.</p>
<pb n="84" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=96"/>
<p>Fresh fruits have a large per cent of water, as high as 89% in the orange, and few fruits have less than 80%. Their food value is mainly in the form of sugar, apples giving us on an average 7.7%, grapes, 14.3%; of proteids, the amount does not, with the single exception of the strawberry, reach 1%; but fruits are very useful to us on account of their flavor, due to various aromatic bodies, fruit acids and sugar. The apple is especially valuable on account of its cheapness and fine keeping qualitites, and is used in a variety of ways by the cook to give a relish to plain materials. Although, our largest use of them is in sweet dishes, they are perhaps quite as valuable used without sugar; they may be fried in slices and eaten with fat meat, as bacon or sausage, or they may be used to stuff a fowl.</p>
<p>Fruit is not for all people easy of digestion if eaten in considerable quantities, and this is partly on account of its relatively large per cent of woody fibre, and also, especially when not quite ripe, because of the acids and pectose contained in them. Huckleberries have 12% woody fibre, apples only 2% including the seeds and skin.</p>
<p>The importance of dried fruits as food is not well enough understood. Fruit loses in drying a large protion of its water, leaving its nutritive parts in more condensed form for our use; dried apples are very near to bread in the per cent of nutrients they offer, and the dried pear may be called the date of Germany, so general is its use. With us this fruit is too expensive, but in parts of Germany the writer has seen dried pears commonly exposed for sale by the
<pb n="85" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=97"/>
barrel like beans; they are eaten in great quantities by the common people, who seem to digest them and dried apples without any trouble, accustomed as their stomachs are to a rye bread and vegetable diet. These dried fruits are made into a variety of dishes with meats, with potatoes and with beans and also with noodles and macaroni.</p>

Indian corn. Perhaps on account of its larger per cent of fat and because little of its albumen is in the form of gluten, it does not form into a sticky paste as does wheat flour, but can be mixed with water only and then boiled or baked into digestible and good tasting food, and this is one thing that makes corn so valuable a grain to people like the negroes of the southern states, whose cooking apparatus is of the most primitive sort.

rolled and spread with some fat, as lard, until the paste is in paper-thick layers with the fat between. When baked, the air expands and separates the flour particles, a true lightness being the result.</p>
<p>So much fat must be employed to produce this result, however, that the use of this method will of course be limited to the construction of dessert dishes, of which not much is eaten at once.</p>

<p>The next most simple method of cooking fine flour, is to introduce between its particles the air adherent to beaten egg, and by the immediate application of heat to expand the air and stiffen the mass thus aerated. By this method none of the food principle is wasted as when yeast is used, nor is a chemical salt left in the dough as in the action of soda, but the method is expensive and is limited in its use to what may be called fancy breads and cakes.</p>

in the flour, but still more at the expense of that which it manufactures out of the starch, or as some say, out of the gluten. The chemist ascertains this loss of nutritive matter to be as high as 1%, and Liebig, who was strongly opposed to this method of bread raising, estimated that 40,000 people might be fed on the flour that was wasted in this way in Germany alone. But notwithstanding this waste, the method, on account of its convenience and the good taste it gives to bread, still holds its ground.</p>
<p>The time cannot be far distant when the baker will furnish us better and cheaper bread than we can make in our own kitchens. This has long been the case on the continent of Europe, but for some reason we have not yet reached that point in civilization and the housekeeper must still learn this art and practice it, for good bread is a necessity.</p>

<p>The best flour is, even for the poor, the cheapest, as it makes more and better bread to the pound. There should always be two kinds kept on hand; the yellowish, high-priced gluten flour for bread making, and the whiter, cheaper sort for pastry, cake and thickenings.</p>
<p>No recipe for making yeast will be given, as the compressed yeast is so much better than the house-wife can make, and is now obtainable even in small towns.</p>

<p>Put the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> into your bread pan and make a hole in the middle, then pour in gradually the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> has been dissolved, mixing as you pour with your hand or with a spoon. As soon as the mass will hold together, take it out on a <implement>moulding board</implement> and with floured hands work it gradually into a tender dough, using as little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as possible, for the dough must remain as soft as can be handled. This first moulding should take from 15 to 20 minutes. Then let the bread rise in a warm place; the yeast plant can live in a temperature ranging from 30&#176; to 170&#176; F. but thrives best at about 72&#176;. Cover with a cloth and in winter keep by a warm stove. If made with <ingredient>compressed yeast,</ingredient> the dough will rise the first time in an hour. Take it at its first lightness, before it begins to sink back (it should be like a honeycomb all through, and double or treble its original bulk), put it on your <implement>moulding board,</implement> or 1/2 of it at a time, and mould it well until it is fine and tender again. Add no flour this time but keep the hands moist with warm water or milk or with lard. Divide into loaves--small ones--which should only half fill the greased tins, and set again to rise, keeping it at the same temperature and letting it get very light again. Flour that is rich in gluten requires longer to rise than that containing more starch.</p>

<hd align="center">Additional facts.</hd>
<p>If more convenient, a bread sponge may be made at first with the water, yeast, and part of the flour, and when light, the rest of the flour added. It hastens the process a little.</p>

<p>On the interaction of bicarbonate of soda and different acids, by which carbonic acid gas is liberated is based a common method of raising doughs. It wastes none of the flour, as does yeast, but it has its own disadvantages. The product of these chemicals acting on each other is a salt which is left in the bread; hydrochloric acid acted on by soda gives common salt, to which there could be no objection, but this method is not easily used in the household, and the salts left by other acids, as the lactic acid of milk when acted on by bicarbonate of soda, we get enough of in other dishes. Whether reliable experiments have been made as to the comparative.

digestibility of breads raised with soda and those raised with yeast the writer does not know, but there is a wide-spread impression that the former should be eaten only occasionally, and it is certain that we tire of them sooner than of yeast breads.

<p>The secret of success in making soda raised breads consists in (1) the perfect mixing of the soda and cream of tartar or the baking powder, with the flour, cooks who are particular sieving these ingredients five times.

<hd align="center">To Dry Bread.</hd>
<p>These are so numerous that the housekeeper need never fear the accumulation of stale bread, if she will only take care of it in time. Every day the bits left from meals and the dry ends of the loaf must be dried hard in the oven and then put away in paper bags. If time allows, pare off the crusts, cut into cubes and dry separately to add to soups.</p>
<p>This dried bread will keep for weeks or months--it must simply be kept clean and dry. In any recipe where bread-crumbs are called for, as bread pudding or bread omelet, use this dried bread, laying it first in <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water till it is soft, then pressing it dry in a towel and crumbling it lightly with the hand.</p>

<hd align="center">SIMPLE SWEET DISHES.</hd>
<p>This department does not pretend to be complete, it simply aims to classify as many of the cheaper kinds as the ordinary family needs. These will generally be used as desserts but there is no reason why the main dish of the meal should not have some sugar in it. I remember that in a simple <emph rend="italic">pension</emph> in Thuringia, Germany, I once ate of a dinner consisting of a soup, a salad and one other dish, which we would call a bread pudding. I was helped bountifully to this main dish of the meal, I ate and was satisfied, for the materials were good and it was well made and delicately baked. The recipe will be found on <ref target="prac122.gif">page 110.</ref></p>

<hd align="center">FRITTERS.</hd>
<p>These are various doughs and batters fried in boiling fat, and eaten warm with sugar or a sweet sauce. The hot fat gives a puffy lightness and a delicious crisp crust.</p>
<p>Lard is most generally used, but cooking oil (see <ref target="prac053.gif">page 41</ref>) is better, and even beef fat prepared as (see same page) is good. The fat must be smoking hot to prevent its soaking into the dough. For the same reason batters so cooked must contain more egg than if they were to be baked.</p>
<subsection class1="breadsweets">

<p>The fritter may be rolled out and cut in shapes, or dropped in spoonfuls or run through a funnel, being, of course, mixed of different consistency for each method.

<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">The Legumes.</hd>
<p>As we have seen, the food value of the dried bean, pea and lentil, is great, but as usually cooked a large per cent of it is lost to us.</p>
<p>In the process of cooking, the cellulose part must be broken up, softened, and as much as possible entirely removed. These vegetables, if they cannot be obtained ground, must be soaked in cold water some time before cooking, cooked till very soft and then mashed and sieved. No form of cooking that does not include sieving can be recommended except for very hardy stomachs. See pages <ref target="prac067.gif">55</ref> and <ref target="prac129.gif">117.</ref></p>
</section>
<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center">Potato.</hd>
<p>This vegetable must also be treated with care. The starch grains of which it is so largely composed swell in the process of cooking, and burst the cellulose walls confining them, but when this stage is reached the potato is too often spoiled by being allowed to absorb steam and become sodden. As soon as tender, boiled potatoes should be drained, dried out for a few moments, then sprinkled with salt, and the kettle covered close with a towel, until they are served. They should then be put into a napkin and sent to the table.</p>
</section>
<section class1="fruitvegbeans">
<hd align="center" placement="heading">Other vegetables.</hd>

longer,--the length of time varying for any given vegetable according to the freshness, size, and degree of maturity. When done or nearly so, they should be seasoned and served as soon as possible.</p>
</section>
<section class1="fruitvegbeans">

<hd align="center">FLAVORS OR SEASONINGS.</hd>
<p>Without doubt "hunger is the best sauce," but it is not true, as many think, that a craving for variety is the sign of a pampered and unnatural appetite; even animals, whom we cannot accuse of having "notions," have been known to starve in the experimenter's hand rather than eat a perfectly nutritious food of whose flavor they had wearied, and prisoners become so tired of a too oft repeated dish that they vomit at the sight and smell of it.</p>
<p>What we call flavors may or may not be associated with a real food. Meats are rich in flavors and each fruit has its peculiar taste; then, there are the spices and aromatic herbs which are not parts of a real food, and it is most important that the cook should understand the art of adding these as seasonings to mild tasting foods, so as to make new dishes which shall be both nutritious and appetizing. The bulk of our nourishment must be made up of the flesh of a few animals, a half-dozen grains and as many garden vegetables, but the skillful cook can make of them, with the help of the other flavors, an endless variety of dishes.</p>
<p>An American traveling on the continent of Europe becomes acquainted with many new dishes and tastes, and although not all of them are to his liking, he must conclude that our cookery, compared for instance,
<pb n="131" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=143"/>
with that of the French, is very monotonous. To be sure, we have the advantage of the European in that our markets offer us a greater variety of natural foods, especially fruits, each having a flavor of its own, and this fact makes us somewhat more independent of the art of the cook; but still we have need for every lesson of this sort, and especially is this the case with the poor, who must keep to the cheapest food materials, which are not in themselves rich in flavor.</p>
<p>Spices and other flavors, when not used to excess, stimulate our digestive organs to appropriate more easily the food to which they are added; their agreeable odor starts the digestive juices, both in the mouth and in the stomach, and their flavor acting on the palate has the same effect.</p>
<p>The more common spices and flavors, as the housewife uses these terms, are salt, pepper, mustard, cinnamon and mace, nutmegs, cloves, ginger, caraway and coriander seeds, vanilla, and many volatile oils, such as those contained in the rind of lemons and oranges; and to this list we must add certain vegetables, as the horseradish and various members of the onion family, the caper and nasturtium seeds, and the aromatic herbs.</p>
<p>All these have their use and their abuse. Salt is hardly thought of in this list, so necessary do we consider it, and its use is well enough governed by our palate, though no doubt we over, rather than under salt our foods. Pepper is also in nearly every household used to excess, being added to too many dishes. The pungent mustard should be still more carefully
<pb n="132" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=144"/>
used; but a little of it adds relish to a salad or a meat sauce, and goes especially well with certain vegetables, as beans. Cinnamon, mace and nutmeg, we use principally with sweet dishes, but nutmeg makes a nice variety in certain meat stews and in croquettes; foreign cooks use it far too much to suit our taste. Almost our only use of the caraway and coriander seeds is in cookies; try the former in a potato soup for variety. Ginger seems to go well woth Indian meal in a pudding or porridge, and with molasses, wherever used.</p>
<p>To give the uses for onions and for the aromatic herbs would be too long a task. The latter can all be bought in a dried state very cheaply, and they retain their flavor well; one of the most useful, however, parsley, is much better fresh; by all means keep a little box of it growing in a window. Perhaps, after onion, celery is most useful as a flavor for soups and stews, root, stem, leaves, and seeds all being valuable.</p>
<p>In the flavoring of soups and stews, it is well to use a number of flavors, letting no one of them be prominent above the others; on the other hand, it is well to have certain favorite dishes seasoned always in the same way; as fresh pork with sage; summer savory in a bread dressing, etc.</p>

<hd align="center">DRINKS AT MEALS.</hd>
<p>A warm drink at meals is better than a cold one, especially in winter or at any time when we are tired; and the drinking of ice water cannot be too strongly condemned, lowering as it does the temperature of the stomach and so delaying digestion. To furnish warm drinks for each meal, acceptable to the palate, cheap and harmless, is no easy question. Soups or broth once adopted as a part of two meals in the day, as is so frequently seen in Europe, and the problem is half solved; indeed some of the drinks here given are really thin vegetable soups or porridges to which the flavor of salt or of sugar may be given according to taste.</p>
<recipe class1="beverages">
<p><purpose align="center" placement="heading">Coffee.</purpose>

It may be concluded, after comparing authors on the subject, that although <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> somewhat retards digestion and acts as a stimulant to the nervous system, still one or even two cups of moderately strong <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> a day will not harm a healthy person. We may say, therefore, that its use to this extent is a question of expense only.</p>
<p><ingredient>Java and Mocha coffee</ingredient> in equal parts are considered the best mixture. <ingredient>Rio</ingredient> is much cheaper, and of strong, pure flavor. The amount to be used for moderately strong <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is 1 tablespoon (ground) to a cup.</p>
<p><ingredient>Chicory</ingredient> is considered here only as an adulterant, whereas in Europe a very little of it, say 1/2 teaspoon of
<pb n="134" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=146"/>
the <ingredient>prepared chicory</ingredient> to a cup of ground <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> is used to improve the flavor.</p>
<p>Next to the quality of the <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> it is of importance that it should be freshly ground and browned. If you buy it browned, reheat it first before grinding. The easiest and most economical way of making is to grind it very fine and put into a bag made of woven stuff, a white stocking top will do; leave room to swell. Heat this in your <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> pot as hot as you can without burning. Pour on <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and keep it hot and close-covered for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Boiling coffee increases its strength, but does not improve its flavor.</p>

<p>The <ingredient>water</ingredient> used should be between hard and soft, extracting the aroma but not the astringency; in China <ingredient>river water</ingredient> is used. If hard water must be used, remember that boiling increases its hardness and that it should be used as soon as it reaches the boiling point.</p>
<p>Take 1 teaspoonful of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> to a cup, put it in the teapot and heat in an oven till hot, pour on 1 cup of <ingredient>water</ingredient> that has just come to a boil, and cover with the <implement>tea cozy.</implement> Let it stand 5 minutes, then fill up with the requisite quanitity of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and serve immediately.</p>

<hd align="center">COOKERY FOR THE SICK.</hd>
<p>It is comparatively easy for your family to live on a small income while all its members are in good health, but you will find your resources all too slender when you must cater for the appetite of an invalid.</p>
<p>At best, sickness is always a severe drain in the limited income, but here, as in every other department of your work, you will find that good sense and ingenuity will often stand you in stead for money.</p>
<p>During a severe illness the food as much as the medicine is under the care of the physician, but when the danger is over and he has left you with only general directions, you will be more than likely in your bewilderment to take the advice of the first neighbor that drops in, although you may know that neither her judgment nor experience is as good as your own.</p>
<p>Now consider first, what did the doctor mean by saying that the patient must be "built up," and how is the wasted frame to get back the fat and muscle that were burned away in the sickness? Chiefly, as you know, by the digestion of food, the proteids and fats and carbohydrates that we have been talking about, and still another, a real food although so often forgotten, the oxygen of the air.</p>
<p>We have said that we need not concern ourselves about this food, that it would take care of itself; and so it will when we are in a state of health and living
<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=150"/>
as human beings should, for as we walk or work we are fed by the air without knowing it. But the case is quite different with a poor invalid shut up in a sick room, we must bring the fresh air to him with as much care and regularity as we do his jellies and broths.</p>
<p>When we are considering what we shall feed our invalid, we cannot do better than keep to our old classification of Proteids, Fats, and Carbohydrates. He must have all these principals but in the most digestable form, for the stomach is feeble like the rest of the body. For this reason the proteids must be furnished mainly from the animal kingdom, butter and cream must supply the fat, and the carbohydrates must bring with them as little as possible of the tough cellulose, and they must be so cooked as to be easily digested.</p>
<p>First, as to the Proteids.</p>
<p>Hot milk, given often in small quantities, is much used in the early stages of recovery and is generally better liked if accompanied by a bit of toasted bread or made into a thin gruel.</p>
<recipe class1="soups" class2="medhealth">
<p>In the first rank, also, comes <purpose><alt synonym1="beef soup for invalids">soup made of lean beef</alt></purpose>

scraped fine, covered with <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> and allowed to stand for an hour, then brought slowly to scalding heat and kept there for a short time; it is then strained through a coarse sieve, the small brown flakes being allowed to pass. Season only with <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> <variation>Or, boil a thick, tender <ingredient>steak,</ingredient> cut it in pieces, and then with a <implement>lemon squeezer</implement> press out every particle of juice, it may then be diluted and seasoned.</variation></p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="soups" class2="medhealth">
<p><purpose>Mutton broth</purpose>

is made like beef soup but should be cooked a longer time. <variation><purpose>Chicken broth</purpose>

also requires more cooking.</variation></p>
</recipe>
<pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=151"/>
<p>Any of these soups may have a little rice or tapioca cooked with them.</p>
<p>Eggs are an important item in the diet of an invalid, being very nutritious and, if fresh, easily digested; do not use them at all if uncertain of their age.</p>
<p>Eggs may be given raw (see <ref target="prac070.gif">page 58</ref>) or soft-boiled (see <ref target="prac071.gif">page 59</ref>) or poached in hot water. An egg may be served in many ways and makes always a pretty and attractive dish. In cooking, it should never be submitted to a high temperature, as that makes the white part horny and indigestible.</p>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy" class2="medhealth">
<p>A <purpose><alt synonym1="custard for invalids">custard</alt></purpose>

made from an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> and a cup of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and a half table spoon of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> may be given early in a convalescence. <variation>Or use <ingredient>beef soup</ingredient> or <ingredient>chicken broth</ingredient> instead of the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and flavor with a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient></variation> These custards should be made in a pail set in a kettle of boiling water, the custard being stirred till it begins to thicken.</p>
</recipe>
<p>Next in order, comes cooked meat. Beef is best of all, but let it be juicy and tender and broil or roast it, serving it rare. Probably a broiled mutton chop ranks next, although chicken, because of its delicate flavor will often receive the first choice. An invalid should not touch pork, and should be given veal or lamb only in the form of soup.</p>
<p>As to fats, the system needs them of course, but fat meat should not be given, only butter or better still, cream. The butter must never be melted and soaked into the food, nor made into a sauce.</p>
<p>As to the vegetable part of the diet, much care must be used. In the form of gruel or porridge, it is generally very welcome and gives the fluid part of
<pb n="140" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=152"/>
the meal in a good form. For Indian meal and oatmeal porridge see <ref target="prac134.gif">page 122.</ref> Milk may take the place of the water.</p>
<p>Toast is with good reason considered invalid's food, for the process of toasting turns part of the starch of the bread into dextrine which is digested with great ease. Grains may be also browned or roasted. Roast rice as you would coffee, cook as usual and eat with a little cream. Remember that bread for toast must be cut thin and first dried out at a little distance from the fire, then brought nearer and browned. You may then serve it as dry toast lightly buttered, or in addition to the butter and a little salt, pour hot water or milk on it just before serving.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" class2="medhealth">
<p><purpose>Panada</purpose>

of <ingredient>toasted brown bread,</ingredient> <ingredient>white bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> is made by piling the pieces in a bowl, having sprinkled either <ingredient>salt</ingredient> or <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> over, and then pouring over enough <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to sak them well. It should be kept hot for an hour or more, the pieces then lifted out carefully on a hot saucer and served with a little cream and perhaps more salt or sugar. <ingredient>Nutmeg</ingredient> may be added.</p>
</recipe>
<p>Rice is also a very valuable food for use in sickness, as it does not tax the most delicate digestion.</p>
<recipe class1="breadsweets" class2="medhealth">
<p><purpose>Macaroni</purpose>

is easily digested and of high food value. It should be boiled in <ingredient>salted hot water</ingredient> till tender and served with a little butter or cream. <variation>Or it may be added to a custard and lightly baked.</variation></p>
</recipe>
<p>Barley, thoroughly cooked, is good food for an invalid. Oatmeal must be used with caution until the digestion becomes stronger.</p>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans" class2="medhealth">
<p>As to vegetables proper, a mealy <purpose>baked potatoe</purpose>

is<pb n="141" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=153"/>
perhaps the first to be introduced into the bill of fare; remove the inside, mash fine and season with a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> Beware of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> cooked in any other way.</p>
</recipe>
<p>The juice of fruits may be used early as a flavor in drinks, but the pulp must be discarded. A baked apple is safest to begin with, when the time comes to introduce fruit as such into the diet.</p>
<p>As to the serving, use the best china, silver and linen that you have in the house and let exquisite neatness never fail.</p>
<p>Remember that surprises are delightful to a sick person; never let the bill of fare be known before hand, and if you can disguise a well known dish, so much the better. Beaten white of egg is a good fairy and serves you cheaply. Snowy white or made golden brown in the oven, it may top many a dish, concealing at one time a custard, at another a mold of chicken jelly or even a cup of delicate apple sauce.</p>
<p>The processes of cooking, if simple, an invalid loves to watch and the sight is often a whet to the appetite. Bring his gruel to him in the form of mush and thin it before his eyes with milk or cream, coddle his egg in a <implement>stone ware bowl</implement> while he eats another course, and by all means make his tea at the bed-side.</p>

<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=155"/>
proteids enough exceeds that required by the dietary adopted so that we can afford this loss. Flour is of medium quality, eggs are reckoned without shell, and milk as weighing 34.4 oz. per qt.</p>
<p>As to prices, they are mainly those of Baltimore markets, corrected in some cases by those of New York. Eggs are reckoned as costing in the spring 18 cts., in Fall and Winter 25 cts., canned fruit is put down at the price paid for the fruit in Summer. The cost of raw material is given in all cases, bread being reckoned at the cost of the flour contained in it.</p>
<p>In three different seasons, four days in succession are selected, these days being the ones considered most trying to the housekeeper--Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and this gives an opportunity to show how the food should be planned and cooked ahead. It is intended that on Saturday the food for Sunday should be cooked as nearly as possible, as the Sunday dinner should be a good one but requiring a minimum of labor on that day; the dinner on Monday should be such as can be cooked on the back of the stove and in the oven.</p>
<p>The recipes will have to be varied a little according to advice given in appropriate places as to economy, <emph rend="italic">e.g.,</emph> substituting beef fat for butter, or adding it when skim milk is used instead of whole milk.</p>
<p>It is intended that each day there shall be a small surplus of money for purchasing seasonings and flavors.</p>

<hd align="center">INTRODUCTION TO BILLS OF FARE, CLASS I.<lb/><emph rend="italic">(To the Mother of the Family.)</emph></hd>
<p>In the general introduction the writer has stated a 
<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=156"/>
few principles that should guide us in choosing our food. We have learned that to keep us in good health and working order we ought to have a certain amount of what is best furnished by meat, eggs, milk and other animal products, and that we must also have fats as well as what is given us in grains and vegetables.</p>
<p>But now our work has only just begun for we are to furnish these food principles in the shape of cooked dishes to be put on the family table three times a day, and the dishes must not only be nourishing but they must taste good, and there must be plenty of variety from day to day; and last--and this is the hardest point of all--we are to try to do this for the sum of <emph rend="italic">13 cents per person daily.</emph></p>
<p>I am going to consider myself as talking to the mother of a family who has six mouths to feed, and no more money than this to do it with. Perhaps this woman has never kept accurate accounts and does not know whether she spends more or less than this sum. She very likely has her "flush" days and her "poor" days according to the varying amounts of the family earnings, and it may be a comfort to her to know that if she could average these days and plan a little better, she can feed her family nicely on this sum.</p>
<p>A few facts as to what the writer knows to have been done in this line will not be amiss. I knew a family of 6 belonging to one of the professional classes, half, grown people, and half, children, that lived for a year on an average of 11 cents per person daily, and no one would have said that they did not live well enough; they had meat about four days out of the seven, there was always cake on their supper table, and they used plenty of fruit.</p>
<pb n="145" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=157"/>
<p>Here is an average bill of fare. Breakfast--milk toast, fried potatoes, coffee; dinner--soup made of shank of beef, fried liver, rice and potatoes; supper--bread and butter fried mush, stewed pears and cake. Next day there was pressed beef made from the soup meat chopped and flavored, and the next day there was cheap fish nicely fried. The head of this household was a skillful economist, absolutely no mistakes were made in cooking, and not a scrap was wasted, she had a long list of simple dishes at her command and she especially studied variety. "I abandon even a favorite dish for weeks," she said, "if any one tires of it." I give this as a sample of what I know to have been done by a highly respectable family in a city of small size in one of our eastern states.</p>
<p>It must be mentioned that the price on which this family lived in comfort could not have been as low as it was but for one great help; they had a small garden that furnished green vegetables and a little fruit. But then almost every family has some special advantage that would lower the rate somewhat; one buys butter or fruit advantageously of friends in the country, another can buy at wholesale when certain staples are cheapest, still another may be able to keep a few fowls, and so on. Numerous instances could be brought to prove that the food for a family can be purchased in a raw condition for the sum per head for which we have undertaken to buy it, and that by skill in cooking, flavoring and giving right variety, a healthful and very acceptable diet can be furnished, though it cannot, of course, contain luxuries.</p>
<pb n="146" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=158"/>
<p>Another thing, when I speak of a woman who is to buy the food of a family for 13 cents apiece daily, I have in mind the wife of a man who earns this sum himself, the wife having her time to attend to the housework and children. If a woman helps earn, as in a factory, doing most of her housework after she comes home at night, she must certainly have more money than in the first case in order to accomplish the same result, for she must buy her bread already baked and can only cook those dishes that take the least time.</p>
<p>I shall take for granted that you have the kitchen utensils described on page 20; if not, buy them, because, you cannot afford to do without them. Food is very expensive compared with pots and pans; you must not spoil food for lack of the right things to cook it in.</p>
<p>I only ask you in advance to try the recipes I shall give and to try to lay aside your prejudices against dishes to which you are not accustomed, as soups and cheese dishes for instance. You cannot afford to reject anything that will vary your diet, for many good tasting things you cannot buy.</p>
<p>I know it is hard for a busy woman to give to her cooking a bit more time than will "just do," but if you make it a rule to determine the night beforehand just what you will cook on the following day, no matter how simple the food may be, you will gain this result; with the materials at your disposal you will put before your family much better food, and they will call you a good cook and think that no family need live better than they; and this impression will be
<pb n="147" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=159"/>
made principally from you having the right variety. Let us understand, to begin with, that it is your business in life just now to conquer this food question as it affects your family. Just as the business man must watch the market and take advantage of a half cent a pound on an article, that he may successfully compete with his neighbor, so you must be on the alert to use every possible advantage. It is a struggle in which energy and calculation will tell for a great deal, and you will have solid enjoyment in every point that you gain.</p>
<p>In buying meat your saving cannot be so much in quantity as in quality. Try to learn the different parts of an animal, and to distinguish between meat from a fat ox and that from a lean one, for, as we have explained, the former has less water in it, and why should you pay good money for that which nature gives you free? In winter, try to buy meat ahead so that you can make it tender by keeping it, and you will notice, too, that the larger the piece you buy the smaller is the per cent of bone you get with it. The per cent of bone in the whole animal, as in the case of an ox, is not more than 10 or 11 per cent, but the buyer of a small piece of meat often gets twice that proportion. As we have said again and again in these pages, the low-priced or tougher parts have as much nutriment for you as the rib roast which is beyond your purse. Choose often the fat middle rib and cook it long and slowly; buy the neck and scrag of mutton, and make a stew with vegetables; buy half a calf's head, and see what a fine soup you can make of it. Have beef's liver now and then, and tripe, rather than put
<pb n="148" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=160"/>
your money into sausage of doubtful quality. By all means buy fish when it is cheap, catfish, for instance, which are excellent fried. Keep suet always on hand and use instead of butter, as has been directed.</p>
<p>No one need tell you how valuable salt pork and bacon are for you,--the only danger is that you will use too much of them.</p>
<p>In buying eggs, you must be governed by the price; in winter use as few as possible, and even in the spring when they are cheapest, remember that they are not as cheap as the lowest priced cuts of meat from fat animals. But when they cost only 15 cents a dozen you can well disregard any small comparison of nutritive values, in consideration of their high worth in furnishing variety; you can afford to use them now and then in the place of meat and in making the various egg dishes.</p>
<p>Of the value of cheese as a regular dish to take the place of meat, you can read in another part of this essay. Buy it once a week at least, the skim variety, if you cannot afford the others, and grate or cook it according to the recipes given.</p>
<p>Try to find a reliable milkman and buy skim milk at half the price of full, and use it for all cooking purposes, keeping full milk, and, if possible, a little of the cream, for coffee.</p>
<subsection class1="breadsweets">
<hd align="center">Grains.</hd>
<p>Now let us take the vegetable part of your diet. You must keep on hand every kind of flour and grain that is not too expensive; be thankful that wheat flour is so good and so cheap, it will be your best friend. If you are not already skillful in using it in bread and other doughs,
<pb n="149" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=161"/>
you will waste your materials and make mistakes at first, but there is nothing for you but to become mistress of this department of cookery. Use bread freely in all the bread dishes, learn how to make every one. You will use buckwheat for cakes, rice for puddings, barley in soups, oatmeal and cornmeal for mushes, and you must learn to use them all in as many ways as possible. The grains are cheaper foods for us than vegetables, although dried peas, beans and lentils follow hard upon them. Even the potato, which may be called our favorite vegetable, is more expensive than wheat flour, if we are talking only of food values.</p>
</subsection>
<p>Except in the height of their season, have nothing to do with green vegetables, at least not under the impression that they are cheap; if you buy them, know that you are paying for flavors and variety, rather than for food. But even in the early spring, buy plenty of such vegetables as onions, carrots, parsley and other green herbs for your soups and stews. When you go for a walk in the country, be sure to bring home mint and sorrel in your pocket; the former will make you a nice meat sauce, the latter a delightful flavor in soup. It will be perfectly easy for you to grow in a window box that delicious herb, parsley, and have it always fresh.</p>
<p>For a low purse, there is no help so great as a knowledge of flavorings. When we remember that we can live on bread, beans, peas and a little cheap meat and fat the year round if we can only make it "go down," we shall realize the importance of such additions as rouse the appetite; there is room here for all your skill and all your invention. Always make a
<pb n="150" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=162"/>
cheap but nutritious dish inviting in appearance; especially does this influence the appetites of children who are delighted with a very plain cake if only a few raisins or some sugar appear on the top.</p>
<p>The Bills of Fare on pages 146 to 158, where 78 cents covers the cost of food for a family of 6 per day, and where the amount of food is carefully weighed and estimated, is meant only to suggest to you how in a few cases your food problem can be solved. You can, no doubt, spend the money in ways that will better suit the tastes of your family, but I beg you to examine anew your favorite dishes to see if they are as nutritious as they should be for their price. Remember that the Proteid column is the one that you must look to most carefully because it is furnished at the most expense, and it is very important that it should not fall below the figures I have given. If, for instance, you should economize in meat in order to buy cake and pastry, this column would suffer at the expense of the other two and your family would be under nourished.</p>

<hd align="center">BILLS OF FARE, CLASS II.</hd>
<p>For family of six. Average price $1.26 per day, or 18 cts per person.</p>
<p>The bills of fare in this class will not be given in detail. Taking those given for Class I as a basis, it is expected that certain luxuries will be added and a better quality of food used; the quantities of Proteid, Fat and Carbohydrate will then not be belowered, which is the point of greatest importance.</p>

<hd align="center">TWELVE COLD DINNERS.</hd>
<p>If a man is to eat a cold dinner for months or even weeks, it is quite worth while to make that dinner as good as it can be, and to pack it nicely for carrying Every one knows how it can take the edge off even a keen appetite to find his sandwich smeared with apple pie, or his cake soaked with vinegar from the pickles. That a box or basket of given dimensions should hold as much as possible, and keep the different kinds of food separate, it must be divided into compartments.</p>
<p>Simplest--an oblong basket,--divided into two compartments by a piece of pasteboard cut so that it slips in rather tightly, then line the two compartments with nice wrapping paper put in fresh every day. It may be divided into four parts in the same way. A close fitting tin spice box is nice for holding cheese. A tiny "salve" box should contain salt and pepper mixed. Sew leather straps on the cover of the basket inside, for holding knife, fork and spoon.</p>
<p>Put a strap around the basket that you may hang from it a little pail containing cold soups recommended for drinks in summer.</p>
<p>Cold puddings should be wrapped in strong writing paper, then in wrapping paper and pinned close.</p>

<hd align="center">THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION,</hd>
<p>Organized in 1872 by a few eminent sanitarians, has grown in fourteen years to be the strongest and ablest association of its kind in America, if not in the world, and contains in its list of members, physicians, lawyers, clergymen, teachers, engineers, architects, and representatives of other trades and professions. Its influence has been felt in the legislative halls of the nation, as well as in every state and territory, for the amelioration of sickness and suffering, and the prolongation of human life.</p>
<p>The fourteen large and elegant volumes it has published are in themselves a monument to American hygiene, while their precepts and teachings have been felt through all ranks and grades of society, from the workshop to the mansion of the millionaire. No library is complete in its literature of sanitation without these works.</p>
<p>Each member of the Association recieves a copy of the annual volume free of expense. This work alone is worth more to any individual than the cost of membership.</p>
<subdiv>
<hd align="center">EXTRACT FROM CONSTITUTION, ART III.</hd>
<p>The members of this Association shall be known as Active and Associate. The Executive Committee shall determine for which class a candidate shall be proposed. The <emph rend="italic">Active</emph> member shall constitute the permanent body of the Association, subject to the provisions of the Constitution as to continuance in membership. They shall be selected with special reference to their acknowledged interest in or devotion to sanitary studies and allied sciences, and to the practical application of the same. The <emph rend="italic">Associate</emph> members shall be elected with special reference to their general interest only in sanitary science, and shall have all the privileges and publications of the Association,
<pb n="184" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=196"/>
but shall not be entitled to vote. All members shall be elected as follows:</p>
<p>Each candidate for admission shall first be proposed to the Executive Committee in writing (which may be done at any time), with a statement of the business or profession, and special qualifications, of the persons so proposed. On recommendation of a majority of the committee, and on receiving a vote of two thirds of the members present at a regular meeting, the candidate shall be declared duly elected a member of the Association. The annual fee of membership in either class shall be five dollars.</p>

<hd align="center">PUBLICATIONS OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION.</hd>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH: REPORTS AND PAPERS OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION. Volumes 1 to 14 inclusive and one volume to be issued annually. These volumes contain the papers presented at the annual meetings of the Association, with the discussions upon each, and constitute large and very handsome works. Each member of the Association is entitled to the annual volume. A small edition is also placed in the hands of the treasurer for sale. At the present time there are but few complete sets on hand, and these are being rapidly taken by libraries.</p>
<p>DISINFECTION AND DISINFECTANTS: THEIR APPLICATION AND USE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASE, AND IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SANITATION, by the Committee on Disinfectants, appointed by the American Public health Association.</p>
<p>The following is a list of authors of this work: GEORGE M. STERNBERG, M. D., Surgeon U. S. Army, and Fellow by Courtesy in the Johns Hopkins University; JOSEPH H. RAYMOND, M. D., Professor of Physiology and Sanitary Science in Long Island College Hospital; VICTOR C. VAUGHAN, M. D., Ph. D., Professor of Physiological Chemistry in the University of Michigan, and Member of the Michigan State Board of
<pb n="185" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=prac&#38;PageNum=197"/>
Health; CHARLES SMART M. D., Surgeon U. S. Army, and member of the National Board of Health; GEORGE H. ROH&#200;, M. D., Professor of Hygiene in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Baltimore; JOSEPH HOLT, M. D., President of the Louisiana State Board of Health; SAMUEL H. DURGIN, M. D., health officer of Boston; and J. R. DUGGAN, M. D.</p>
<p>The original experimental ivestigations made by these specialists are of great importance and value, and render this work the most complete and practical volume upon disinfection and disinfectants yet published. A large amount of original work is devoted to the various micro-organisms, and in determining the value of many of the so-called disinfectants and germicides. The biological work was conducted mostly at the Johns Hopkins University under the Supervision of Dr. Sternberg, and at the University of Michigan under Dr. Vaughan. Various apparatus used for disinfecting purposes, as well as the admirable quarantine system at New Orleans, are fully described and illustrated. The chapter on PTOMAINES, by Dr. Vaughan, is of great value.</p>
<p>The labors and investigations of these gentlemen extended over a period of three years, and involved no inconsiderable expense.</p>
<p>The work consists of two hundred and sixty-five pages, with sixty-eight illustrations, printed upon very heavy paper made especially for this volume, and is elegantly bound in handsome English cloth. The price has been placed at the low figure of two dollars per volume. Sent postpaid on receipt of price.</p>
