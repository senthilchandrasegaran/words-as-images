<div type="preface"><pb n="preface" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=13"/><hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">PREFACE</hd><p>AN active teacher and a constant student must in twenty years collect and accumulate a vast amount of knowledge; in fact, too much to be embodied in a single book.</p><p>I have no apology to offer for the appearance of a new book on Domestic Science, especially this one. It represents on paper The School at its period of highest development, and the results of hard work of the best years of my life. Please read carefully each chapter of instructions preceding the recipes, for herein lies the great value of the work. I have not compiled a recipe book, but have made a complete new book telling the things one needs to know about cooking, living, health, and the easiest and best way of housekeeping. It is a book of general household knowledge.</p><p>A great change in the methods of living has taken place in America during the last few years. There was a time in the memory of teachers yet quite young when schools of cookery were places where persons were taught to make all sorts of fancy, odd and occasionally used dishes. In fact, to succeed with these elaborate dyspeptic-producing concoctions was the highest ambition. All this has now changed: the teacher or cook book<pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=14"/> (an ever present teacher) that does not teach health, body building, and economy in time and money, is short lived. There are still a few women who do elaborate cooking to please the palate and appetite, and the general habits of people. They are still in the palate stage of existence. Strive to reach a higher plane of thought--eat to live. Why should any woman be asked to stand for hours over a hot fire mixing compounds to make people ill? Is this cookery? Is the headache that follows a food debauchery more pleasant or pardonable or less injurious than that which follows drink? Results of intemperance are identical. Simple living and high thinking have the approval of learned men and women, but, like all temperance questions, depend so much upon habit, education and palate that progress must be slow; but there is no better stimulant to the enthusiastic worker than slow progression&#173;&#173;the constant but regular improvement.</p><p>It has been fifteen years since I published my first book; during this time I have seen the art progress from "fancy cookery" to the highest type of Domestic Science. It has found a permanent place in the curriculum of our public schools, where it has been most valuable as a means of mental and moral training as well as useful for the individual in home keeping or obtaining a livelihood, all of which tend to and aid in the development<pb n="5" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=15"/> of industries. To fit students for living should be the main object of public education.</p><p>I believe that every woman should know how to housekeep. Giving up entirely the moral influence of a good meal, I believe that all women should learn to cook as an aid to higher education. Cookery puts into practice chemistry, biology, physiology, arithmetic, and establishes an artistic taste. And if our motto is, "Let us live well, simply, economically, healthfully and artistically," we have embraced all the arts and sciences.</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd rend="bold" align="center">CHEMISTRY OF FOOD</hd><p>Of all the changes brought about during the Nineteenth Century, few have had a greater influence for good than the progress made in scientific cookery. A proper understanding of the conditions under which we live is of vital importance and assistance to the housewife and mother. Domestic science, including chemistry of food, is now taught in nearly all the public schools of our large cities. The young child is able to tell not only the chemistry of common foods, but the effect of heat upon them. These girls when they reach womanhood will be able to select and cook foods necessary to sustain and build the body-?they will know the elements of food, the general plan of body building.</p><p>Let us compare the living machine, the human body, to the railroad engine or locomotive. For both it is necessary to begin by selecting materials for the general structure. When these materials have been worked and fitted together, fuel must be constantly supplied and an abundance of air to make it burn; and in the third place water is required. As a result of this combination, motion, heat and waste are produced.</p><p>Pure air is of vast importance in body building. The oxygen uniting with the combustible part of the materials produces energy. The approximate principles of the body are resolved into about sixteen elements, each of which must be constantly sustained and nourished. A "perfect" or "complete" food contains all the elements necessary for the building of body. There are in the body five gases: Oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine and fluorine. The four solids are carbon, sulphur, phosphorus and silica. Seven minerals: Cal-cium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, manganesium and a trace of iron and copper. Oxygen, hydrogen and carbon are found in nearly all the tissues and fluids of the body. Seventy-five per<pb n="10" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=20"/> cent of the adult human body is water; the proportion is greater in infants and less in the aged. It is one of the essentials in carrying on the vital processes. It dissolves substances necessary for the nutrition of the body, and carries from it the waste products. It is the medium in which chemical reaction takes place, and which carries the nutrient materials from one place to another. A considerable increase of water in the body, however, is looked upon as unfortunate, while a deficiency, if prolonged, causes a retention and accumulation of waste in the body, resulting in imperfect nutrition, and is one of the chief causes of constipation.</p><p>Potassium chloride is found in the cells of tissues and in the muscle juices and nerve tissues. Green plants contain more potassium than sodium salts. This is also true of the potato; hence, succulent green vegetables supply to the system one of the necessary elements. We are told that green vegetables have no food value, and, according to the common acceptance of the meaning of these words, we can readily understand that they lack tissue-building elements; but they contain salts, which play a very important part in body building. Magnesium is found with lime in the tissues. No one has ever discovered its particular use, but there it is, a constant ingredient in the muscles and brain. To have a perfect diet, one must select from all the food products, not live on a too concentrated or restricted diet.</p><p>Nutrition may be said to take place under five conditions: Digestion, absorption, assimilation, destructive metabolism and elimination or excretion. The first begins in the mouth and continues throughout the alimentary canal; it is the process by which food is converted into assimilable compounds. All foods are not immediately assimilated or used; some are stored for future use. For instance, starch is digested and stored in the liver as 
<emph rend="italic">glycogen</emph>. The carbo&#173;hydrates are burned for heat and energy, and the excess stored as fat in the connective tissues. Destructive metabolism is a process that is continually going on in the tissues; a sort of tearing out of the dead cells during the activity of building the new. For example, the waste products cast out of the lungs are products <pb n="11" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=21"/> of destructive metabolism. They are no longer required by the system, are, in fact, in the way, and must be thrown aside for new materials.</p><p>The relations between food, exercise and habits of the individual must be in proper proportion to the food ingested. The works of the body are of two kinds, muscular and nervous, and the internal as well as the external work is done by the stored energy produced by the burning or oxidization of the foods. Persons frequently forget that every time the  heart  beats, blood is consumed to produce the muscular action. In the energy of living, we use blood produced from the food we eat.</p><p>Alimentary principles may be divided into three classes: The albuminoids, nitrogenous foods or proteids; three words meaning the same, and comprising  lean meats,   fish,  mollusks ( oysters  and  clams ), the crustaceae ( lobsters,   crabs,  shrimps),  cheese,  casein in  milk,  legumin found in the leguminous  seeds,  as old  peas,   beans and lentils,  nitrogenous matter in  nuts  and the gluten of grains. The second division, non-nitrogenous or carbonaceous foods, consists of fats and the carbo-hydrates, the  sugars,  starches and mucilage, inulin and pectose, found in sea weeds and certain vegetables. The third group consists of inorganic foods,  water  and mineral salts.</p><p> Eggs  and  milk  are typical or perfect foods; that is, they contain within themselves all the elements necessary for the development of the young of their especial kind. The  egg  is a perfect food for the development of the chick, and  milk  for the young mammal; neither of these are, however, perfect foods for the human adult. When added to our daily bills of fare they are placed in the nitrogenous or albuminous group, and served with such foods as  white bread  and  butter.   Cows '  milk,  a typical food for the  calf,  is by no means a typical food for the human being. Nor would human  milk  supply the requirements of the  calf.  The  calf  gets its growth in from four to five years; from infancy to manhood is three times that long. One can see at a glance that such food would quite upset the delicate digestive apparatus of an infant. When we go contrary to the laws of nature, sickness and suffering are the results.  Cows '<pb n="12" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=22"/>  milk  does not agree with the average infant; it was never meant to agree and has no right to agree. In vegetable foods the carbo-hydrates predominate and must therefore be mixed with nitrogenous substances, in order to form a perfect diet. Many vegetables are rich in nitrogen, others in  starch.  In arranging our daily bills of fare these must be blended.</p><p><emph rend="italic">A perfect diet</emph> consists of common food materials blended to suit the age, sex, occupation and climate in which the individual lives. They must not only be well proportioned, but well selected and taken in proper quantities, or they are worse than waste, as their presence clogs the delicate digestive organs, throwing them out of order. There is more danger from over-eating than from under-eating. When persons reach middle life or a little beyond there is less vigor, hence, less necessity for a large quantity of food. People who disobey this rule either accumulate  fat  and become unwieldy, or wear out the secretory organs, and have such diseases as gout, rheumatism, Bright's disease, and many kindred complaints. Rich and highly-seasoned dishes please the palate and induce the thoughtless to take greater quantities of food than can be assimilated; too much  meat,  too many starchy foods and sweets with too few green vegetables and  fruits  produce torpid or over-worked  livers.  Men as a class eat too much  meat,  and are prone to  kidney  and  liver  troubles; women eat too much  starch  mixed with  sugar  and cooked  butter,  as in cakes,  preserves  and puddings, and are prone to corpulency and constipation.</p><p>The total amount of food required each twenty-four hours varies, of course, with the occupation and condition of the individual. The average adult in exercise requires as a day's ration about six pounds; of this amount about three and a half pounds will be  water,  much of which is found in the common foods and taken in beverages. Of the remaining part, one-fourth will be nitrogenous matter; three-fourths carbonaceous, with about two hundred grains of mineral matter. This is not the amount consumed by the average American, but the amount he 
<emph rend="italic">should</emph> consume.</p><p>Animal foods, being richer in albuminoids or nitrogenous <pb n="13" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=23"/> constituents, must be taken in small quantities. By mixing a small amount of  lean beef  with  bread  or  potato we get a food palatable, attractive and containing the necessary requirements. A mixture of  beans and  potatoes will contain rather more of the tissue-building elements. It would require two pounds of ordinary  bread  to supply the nitrogen in twelve ounces of  meat.  Three meals a day might be arranged from a table of ingredients containing the proper proportions of all the elements:</p><list><item align="center"> Bread. ......................................... 12 oz.</item><item align="center"> Butter. ......................................... 3 "</item><item align="center"> Milk. ........................................... 4 "</item><item align="center"> Potato. ......................................... 6 "</item><item align="center"> Rice. ........................................... 4 "</item><item align="center"> Cabbage. ........................................ 6 "</item><item align="center">Cheese.......................................... 4 "</item><item align="center"> Sugar. .......................................... 1 "</item><item align="center"> Water  alone, including that in  tea  and coffee.. 55 "</item></list><p>A second illustration will give another example of the same idea:</p><list><item align="center"> Beef,  weighed raw.............................. 12 oz.</item><item align="center">Whole  wheat bread. ............................. 23 "</item><item align="center"> Butter. ......................................... 3 "</item><item align="center"> Potato. ........................................ 10 "</item><item align="center"> Water. ......................................... 55 "</item></list><p>Each one of these articles may be replaced by another of the same class. For instance, old  beans are nitrogenous or muscle-making foods and may be substituted for  beef;   cheese,  the casein of  milk,  may be substituted for either  beef  or  beans;  rice,   macaroni,   white bread,  boiled  chestnuts,   white  or  sweet potato es,  are each interchangeable one with the other, at different meals.  Olive oil,   cream,  oleaginous  nuts  and  butter  are also interchangeable. When green or succulent vegetables or  fruits  are used, less  water  is required. It is wise to serve  fruits  with cereals or breads, vegetables with  meats,   cream  with starchy puddings,  olive oil  with green vegetables. Digestion is more easily performed with correct combinations.</p><pb n="14" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=24"/><p> Starch  does not occur in animal foods, but nitrogen is found abundantly in many vegetables. Nitrogenous foods are, as a rule, more easily digested uncooked. All starchy foods must be well and thoroughly cooked.</p><p>In old  peas,   beans and lentils  the  starch  is so incorporated with legumin, the nitrogenous principle, that the cooking must be long and slowly done in order to soften the envelope or wall of the  starch  granules, otherwise fermentation or flatulency will result.</p><p>The first object of cooking is to assist digestion. Careful, simple cooking only can do this; for instance, baked or boiled  potatoes are easily digested; when fried the  starch  granules are covered with a coating of  fat  which prevents digestive secretions from acting on them; frying renders them difficult of digestion. A large quantity of fried foods may be eaten without nourishing the body; and of one thing we are quite sure, they always tax the digestive organs. Many foods are chemically changed in the process of digestion.  Starch  is not found in the blood as  starch,  but is changed by 
<emph rend="italic">enzymes</emph> (unorganized ferments) in the digestive secretions, into  sugar.  The 
<emph rend="italic">ptyalin</emph> of the saliva, the 
<emph rend="italic">pepsin</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">rennin</emph> of the stomach, the 
<emph rend="italic">trypsin, amylopsin,</emph> and 
<emph rend="italic">steapsin</emph> of the intestinal secretions are 
<emph rend="italic">enzymes.</emph></p><p>The 
<emph rend="italic">enzyme ptyalin</emph> in the saliva (an alkaline medium) acts upon the  starch  precisely the same as 
<emph rend="italic">diastase,</emph> which is found in the common malt extracts. If our foods are well cooked and thoroughly masticated we assist in the digestion of the starches and save the cost of "aids to digestion." Digestion is natural; indigestion, the artificial digestion, unnatural.</p><p>The secretions of the stomach are slightly acid and have no effect upon starches. The starches are separated in the stomach from other substances and passed on into the second stomach, the 
<emph rend="italic">duodenum,</emph> the upper part of the small intestine, where again, in the presence of alkaline secretions, they meet the 
<emph rend="italic">enzyme amylopsin,</emph> which continues and completes the digestion begun in the mouth.</p><p>The nitrogenous foods are torn apart by mastication; they enter the stomach (an acid medium), and in the presence of <pb n="15" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=25"/> the enzyme pepsin are partly or wholly digested, as the conditions may be; if the digestion is not finished, they pass into the duodenum where in the presence of an alkaline medium, digestion is continued by the enzyme trypsin. The oils are emulsionized in the small intestine in an alkaline medium, by enzyme steapsin and the bile.</p><p>Defective teeth and hasty mastication are frequently the primary causes of indigestion. Soft foods are to be especially condemned; mushes, for instance, should be masticated, other-wise they pass into the small intestine in an unprepared condition. Starches are burned in the body to produce heat and energy; they also produce  fat.  If taken in excess of that needed for immediate use, are stored as  fat  in the connective tissue. Fats and oils are burned in the body to produce heat and energy. Too much  starch  and  sugar  increase the weight of the body and crowd the  liver.  The albuminoids build the muscular lean flesh and tissues. Mineral matter aids in the formation of the teeth and  bones.  The cereals are rich in these salts, hence, are admirable foods for the young, not infants, but for children sufficiently old to have teeth for mastication, and for nursing mothers.</p><emph rend="bold">DIET TABLE</emph><p>This table shows the quantity of nitrogenous and carbona-ceous elements in one hundred parts of some of our common foods and will assist in arranging a well balanced dietary.</p>

<chapter class1="generalnonfood"><hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">KITCHEN CALENDAR</hd><p>The inexperienced housewife finds more or less difficulty in determining the exact time required for cooking the various vegetables and meats so that they may all be done for the same meal at the same time. Thermometers for ovens have not, until recently, been in general use. Now one can have the so-called &#34;thermometer,&#34; really an indicator, put into the oven door of any modern range, either gas, coal or wood, and at a very small cost; thus relieving the cook from the necessity of standing and watching and making unsatisfactory attempts to ascertain the true heat of the oven. One cannot always tell what is meant by a moderate, moderately cool or quick oven, unless one has had long experience, and even then there is a lack of exactness and an unusual amount of worry. In this calendar, we refer only to Fahrenheit.</p><p>A potato will bake in three-quarters of an hour at a temperature of 300&#176; Fahr.; it will harden on the outside and almost burn at a temperature of 400&#176; in twenty minutes, and if the oven is only 220&#176; it will take one hour and a quarter to a half.</p><p>In boiling meats always use boiling water and after the first five minutes of rapid boiling reduce the temperature to 180&#176;, and cook twenty minutes to each pound. The meat must always be covered with water.</p><p>In making stews where the meat is cut into small pieces, it is better to heat it at first in a little fat, then make the sauce and allow the meat to cook for two hours at a temperature of 180&#176;.</p><p>An eight pound turkey with stuffing should go into an oven at 400&#176; for a half hour to seal the outside, and then bake at 280&#176; for two hours longer. Without stuffing, the oven must be 400&#176; for a half hour and then dropped to 280&#176; for an hour and a half.</p><p>A four pound chicken with stuffing will bake at 400&#176; for a <pb n="18" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=28"/> half hour; and then one and a half hours at 280&#176;; the same sized chicken not stuffed, a half hour at 400&#176;, then one hour at 280&#176;.</p><p>A tame duck stuffed with potatoes placed in an oven at 360&#176; requires one hour to brown and one hour at 230 to finish.</p><p>A goose must be cooked according to its age, and it is very difficult to select a young goose unless one is experienced. See directions for selecting geese. If they are stuffed with potatoes, cook in an oven at 400&#176; for thirty minutes; then for two hours at 230&#176;, basting frequently.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">SCHEDULE FOR FISH AND GAME</hd><p>Fish take on their weight in length rather than bulk, which gives a specific time independent of weight. Brown quickly for a half hour, then cook at 300&#176; for a second half hour. Planked fish under the gas or before a wood fire will require thirty minutes, and in a coal, wood or oil oven forty-five minutes.</p><p>Oysters are done when the gills are thoroughly curled.</p><p>Game such as woodcock, snipe and pheasants, must be roasted or baked continuously for thirty minutes at 400&#176;.</p><p>Partridge, split down the back, thirty minutes at 400&#176;.</p><p>Prairie chicken forty-five minutes at 400&#176;.</p> 
<p>A haunch of venison will cook in a quick oven at 400&#176; about thirty minutes, then bake slowly for two hours at 300&#176;, basting frequently.</p><p>To test run a skewer in the fleshy part and if the blood follows upon drawing the skewer out and the meat at the same time is tender and rare, it is done.</p><p>All red meats should be served rare; all white meats well done.</p><p>All meats should be easily done before being seasoned with salt, as the salt draws out the juices and toughens the fibre, making even good meat dry and unpalatable.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">GENERAL BAKING IN COAL OR WOOD STOVE</hd><p>All meats must go into a very hot oven (400&#176;). After they have been thoroughly seared on the outside cool down the oven<pb n="19" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=29"/> to 260&#176;, when the fat will begin to melt. Baste with this fat every fifteen minutes. Do not use water.</p><p>Bread in small French loaves will be baked continuously at 360&#176; for 30 minutes; square loaves at 300&#176; for ten minutes and for fifty minutes at 260&#176;.</p><p>Pastry, such as patties and tarts, for twenty minutes at 360&#176;.</p><p>Muffins, gems, sally lunns and other light breads twenty minutes at 360&#176;.</p><p>Corn bread in shallow pans forty-five minutes at 360&#176;.</p><p>Pies with upper crust thirty minutes at 360&#176;; with under crust thirty minutes at 340&#176;.</p><p>Apples, cored, in a slow oven at 260&#176;, so that they may become soft without hardening the skin.</p><p>Cakes without butter require a hot oven 300&#176; to 360&#176;.</p><p>Four-egg sponge cake, twenty minutes; six-egg sponge cake thirty minutes; ten-egg sponge cake, forty-five minutes.</p><p>Angel food and sunshine cake, baked in pans made for the purpose, require a cool oven, 230&#176;, which is gradually increased during the first half hour to 260&#176;, baking in all three-quarters of an hour. If the cake is not brown at the end of this time increase the heat for just a moment until it assumes the proper color.</p><p>Cakes containing butter, such as pound cake, cup cake and fruit cake, must be baked in a very slow oven.</p><p>Fruit cake may be steamed for three hours and finished in an oven at a temperature of 240&#176;, or it may be put into an oven at 220&#176; for three hours and finished at 260&#176; for one hour.</p><p>For gas baking allow twenty degrees less than the above.</p><pb n="20" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=30"/><p>The time required for cooking green vegetables:</p><list size="smaller"><item>Green peas, young and fresh.......................... 15 minutes </item> <item>Green peas, old and not fresh........................ 30 "</item> <item>String beans......................................... 45 "</item> <item>Beans, shelled (green)............................... 45 "</item><item>Lima beans, young, fresh............................. 30 "</item><item>Lima beans, dried (soaked)........................... 45 "</item><item>Cabbage, whole head, simmer.......................... 2 hours</item><item>Cabbage, half head................................... 1 hour</item> <item>Cabbage, quarter head................................ 30 minutes</item> <item>Cabbage, chopped..................................... 20 minutes</item><item>Cauliflower and Broccoli............................. 30 "</item><item>Cucumbers, cut into quarters......................... 30 "</item><item>Squash, pared and cut into blocks.................... 20 "</item><item>Pumpkin, in squares for pies......................... 30 "</item><item>Tomatoes, peeled and stewed.......................... 30 "</item><item>Tomatoes, baked, whole, slow oven.................... 1 hour</item><item>Tomatoes, stuffed and baked.......................... 1 "</item><item>Green peppers, stuffed............................... 1 "</item><item>Green peppers, stewed................................ 30 minutes</item><item>Onions, new.......................................... 45 "</item><item>Spanish onions, whole................................ 2 hours</item><item>Spanish onions, cut into slices...................... 1 hour</item><item>Okra................................................. 1 "</item><item>Celery, stewed....................................... 30 minutes</item><item>Spinach.............................................. 10 "</item><item>Brussels sprouts, fresh.............................. 30 "</item><item>Kale................................................. 45 "</item> <item>Bananas, baked (240&#176;)............................ 30 "</item><item>Apples, sweet, baked (slow).......................... 30 "</item><item>Apples, sour, baked (slow)........................... 20 "</item></list><p>All underground vegetables are as a rule rich in woody fibre; use boiling, unsalted water to start, adding salt when they are partly cooked.</p>

<p>Preserve all fruits when at their height; they are then in season. This rule will apply also to canning or jelly making. In the South, of course, the time will be earlier than in the far North. It is a well-known fact that green fruits contain a goodly amount of pectose, which by the action of natural ferments in the fruit is changed to pectin. This pectin exists in a ready formed condition in Irish moss, and is found in fruits just ripe. In a day this is again changed, hence over-ripe fruits will not make firm jelly. See jelly making.</p><p>Tomatoes should be canned during August; after that time they lose their solidity and become watery, also their sweetness of flavor and become more acid.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">MEATS</hd><p>Beef and mutton are used the year round, but are really in best condition and in season during the winter months.</p><p>Veal and lamb are in season during the spring months, from the first of April to the first of June.

Our country being large, the climate so very different in different parts, vegetables, like fruit, are in season the whole year. Celery in New York, Philadelphia and Boston is truly in season during the winter; from the South, as early as July 1st. Lettuce can be had all the year round; in the winter it is grown in hot houses, or comes from the far South; while in summer we have a home production, which is less desirable than that grown in winter.</p><p>Mushrooms are grown in cellars or fields, and can be purchased at any season. We have a number of vegetables that can be grown in any garden during the summer and put aside to keep for winter use. It is well to remember that appetites are destroyed by too much sameness. Use vegetables in season in the locality in which you live. Such vegetables as carrots, turnips, parsnips, beets, cabbage, onions, celery, salsity, leeks, endive and potatoes are easily kept for winter use. This relieves you of the necessity of canning vegetables. Tarragon, parsley and herbs may be dried just before the flowering-season. Green peppers and okra are also easily dried. The winter vegetables are greater in number than the summer ones, hence it not necessary to can and preserve such foods, unless one lives on a narrow diet.</p> 
<p>Winter vegetables are sweet and white potatoes, artichokes,<pb n="32" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=42"/> celery, endive, cabbage,onions, leeks, chicory, yellow and white turnips, kale, winter squash, pumpkins, mushrooms, old peas, beans, lentils, old beets, salsify, carrots and parsnips.</p><p>Spring.-All the above with spinach, scullions, dandelions, asparagus, poke, corn, salad and early lettuce added.</p><p>Summer-Peas, string-beans, summer squash, cucumbers, tomatoes, sweet corn, new potatoes, lima beans, new beets, lettuce, fresh sweet peppers, mushrooms, summer cabbage, egg plant, okra, Brussels sprouts and onions.</p><p>Autumn or Fall.?Potatoes, sweet and white; celery, cabbage, tomatoes, peppers, lima beans, corn, Brussels sprouts, kidney beans, onions, cos or Romaine, new white turnips and new carrots.</p>

Heat does not always, alter the chemical constituents of food, but when properly applied, practically aids digestion. Such changes may not be detected by chemical analysis, and yet be perceptible to the digestive apparatus.</p><p>Heat coagulates and hardens albumin. Thus we say meats are rendered less digestible by cooking. Cooking is necessary, however, to remove the danger of poisonous germs. The woody fibre of vegetables is softened by moist, slow cooking, the starch cells are ruptured, and the whole is made more easy of digestion. A slow, moist heat softens the fibre of meat; an intense heat hardens and toughens it. Meat slowly cooked at a temperature of 180&#176; Fahr. becomes tender, juicy and easily digested; when boiled at a gallop the 
<emph rend="italic">connective</emph> dissolves, the meat falls from the bones and into strings, but the fibre is not tender. Such boiled meat is leathery and difficult of digestion.</p><p>The cooking of meat also enables it to be more readily masticated. In the raw state it is rather tough and can be torn apart only with great difficulty. One can easily observe this by the method in which the lion pulls the flesh from the bones while he is eating.</p><p>Albumin exists in the juices of meat as well as in the blood, and unless the outside of each piece is coagulated ("sealed") at once, much nourishment is lost, but a continued high temperature is a disadvantage.</p><p>The results of cooking depend much more upon the skill of the cook than the amount of money spent for material.</p><p>A piece of so-called inferior meat in the hands of an educated cook will he sent to the table palatable, sightly and nutritious.<pb n="34" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=44"/> But the finest roasts our markets afford are dry, tasteless and valueless when badly cooked.</p><p>The most experienced chemist with all his modern apparatus cannot demonstrate the causes and sources of flavors. Practical taste and experience alone create and detect flavors--the cook holds the secret.</p> 
<p>The pleasure of eating, digestion and health depend upon the knowledge of the cook. Good, wholesome and nutritious food is always attractive, palatable and pleasure giving.</p><p>Heat is applied to animal and all vegetable foods, either by boiling steaming and braising-?moist heats; broiling or grilling and roasting-?dry heat in an abundance of air; baking?-dry heat, as in an oven; frying?-immersing in hot fat; and saut&#233;ing?-cooking in a little fat.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">THE STOVES AND FUEL WITH WHICH WE COOK</hd><p>Combustion or burning means the rapid union of a substance with oxygen. The temperature at which the burning takes place is called the kindling point. The article burned is burned or oxidized. This burning is also called oxidization. Oxygen exists free (this means that it is not combined with other materials) in the air, and forms about one-fifth of its volume. Wood, oil and coal are composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen, and are all incapable of supporting combustion or burning without the assistance of oxygen. Hence, all our household structures or stoves for the burning of wood or coal have a draft at the bottom of the fire-box.</p><p>In gas and oil stoves oxygen is supplied through perforations at the base of the burners. In a gas stove we call them mixers, or Bunsen burners. In an oil stove a perforated tube encircles the wick, allowing the air to enter equally at all points. This mixture of air with gas produced by the burning wick gives the blue flame, the same as the burner on the gas stove. Where a balance is kept up there are no free particles of carbon to deposit themselves upon the utensils in the form of soot. Too much air hinders combustion; the direct pipe or chimney damper should be closes as soon as the fire is kindled. This<pb n="35" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=45"/> will save the fuel and keep up an intense and even heat throughout the stove. All properly arranged stove drafts are adapted to the size of the fire-box and constructed to admit the least possible quantity of air beyond that necessary for active combustion. The cook who opens wide the lower door has not vet learned how to make or keep a good cooking fire. When the fire does not burn she gives it an occasional "poke," which still further deadens it.</p><p>Gas is the cheapest and most easily managed of all fuels providing care is given to its use. A good gas stove well managed will, counting in the time for care and lack of dust, cost one-third less than coal. A good blue-flame oil stove is quite its equal as far as cooking is concerned, but requires more care, as it must be filled and have the wicks adjusted each day. In the hands of a careful cook neither gas nor oil stoves give off unpleasant odors. For all cooking purposes, a blue flame is desirable. For illumination, a red flame. Coal and charcoal are mostly carbon in rather an impure state. Hard or anthracite coal being dense, almost pure carbon, must be heated throughout before combustion will take place. For this reason, on kindling a coal fire some lighter material which will, while burning, heat the coal, must be used. When once heated to the point of combustion the coal readily takes fire, and other coal placed on top of the hot coal will, in turn, burn. Wood on top of coal deadens and smothers the fire.</p><p>Boxes or stoves used for heating or cooking purposes are not complete unless they are attached to a chimney or flue. Flames tend upward; heated air expands, becomes lighter and is pressed upward by the heavier air with which it is surrounded. The fire is kindled at the bottom of the stove where the cold air enters the fire-box, and this is also at the bottom of the chimney. Thus, as the air is heated, it is pressed upward in the chimney, causing a "draft." The cold air coming in at the bottom in its turn is heated, and so keeps on this continuous pushing upward The chimney also serves to carry off the poisonous products of combustion. Any interference with the upward tendency of hot air causes the chimney to smoke. There are several causes for smoky chimneys. The rate of motion of the current varies<pb n="36" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=46"/> with the size, height or length and temperature of the chimney. A cold chimney, one that has been standing idle all summer, or a new chimney will smoke. The fresh brick and mortar are good conductors of heat, and absorb it so rapidly that the rising current becomes cold, condenses and obstructs the ascent. The smoke crowded underneath fills the chimney and is forced down and into the room. To avoid this, start a fresh fire with an abundance of light material, such as shavings or excelsior, until the chimney is heated and the smoke begins to ascend easily; then add hard wood or coal.</p><p>It must be remembered that with this smoke come also the poisonous products of combustion, which make a perfect flue a necessity. The higher the chimney, the greater the draft. A brick chimney, however, may be so high that it will cool the air current below the top or outlet. For this reason, pipes of galvanized iron are used as extension shafts. High buildings and tall trees overshadowing a chimney frequently disturb the draft, which is another cause for smoking chimneys. The wind passes down the chimney with sufficient rapidity to cool the ascending air, which is forced back and down into the room.</p><p>In wood fires we frequently notice volumes of flame coming out through the openings of the stove. Such conditions can be regulated only by extensions to the chimney. An ordinary cook stove with such a draft would, on a quiet day, bake beautifully, but never when the wind is blowing. To condemn a stove thus placed would be folly. In this country there are very few ill-constructed cooking-stoves; the defects are usually in the chimneys. Chimneys built on the south or east side of a house give less trouble than those on the west or north side. The cold air is apt to chill them.</p><p>When there are two fireplaces in the house, or a fireplace below and a stove entering the chimney above, the fire in one or the other will not burn well unless the one not used is closed. For example, if a fire is lighted on the first floor and the stove or pipe hole is open on the second, the current is interrupted and the room will fill with smoke and gas. This difficulty will be remedied by keeping the stove closed on the second floor while the fire is burning on the first floor, or closing the <pb n="37" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=47"/> chimney place below, or lighting a fire in it when there is a fire on the second floor. Air entering a flue or stovepipe horizontally will also interrupt the draft. For this reason a damper in the stovepipe is used to cool off or check the fire.</p><p>Anthracite coal being nearly solid carbon may be arranged to "keep." To accomplish this, lift the lid on the top of the stove, or open a little damper at the top of the fire-box; this will allow cold air to enter, pass over the upper surface of the coal, chill it, and prevent rapid burning. As this is imperfect combustion, great care must be taken to have the chimney flue open, that the products of combustion may not come out into the room. Carbon-monoxide, the product of imperfect combustion, is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas. Being an accumulative poison it is still more dangerous. As hard coal contains a little sulphur, the odor of the sulphur is noticed, when the drafts are imperfect, which is like the sounding of an alarm-bell, for carbon-monoxide is found in its company.</p><p>Gas stoves used continually for cooking purposes must, like coal stoves, be attached to a chimney to carry off the poisonous products of combustion. There is less danger in summer, when all doors and windows are open.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">GAS COOKERY</hd><p>The application of heat is just the same, no matter what fuel is used. Oil, gas, wood or coal gives about the same result, when managed by a trained housewife. Gas cooking is the ideal cooking. It is economical and cleanly, two very important points. Roasting and broiling in a gas stove are done underneath the gas jets, in other words in the lower oven, by some called the broiling oven or broiling chamber. The oven must be heated for five or eight minutes before using.</p><p>Where economy of space must be observed a small flat top gas stove with three burners with a steam cooker and a portable oven, will easily serve a family of six to eight. The baking is done precisely the same as in any other stove. Heat all ovens thoroughly before putting in the articles. Some cakes require<pb n="38" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=48"/> a cool oven, but even then jets must be lighted a few minutes before using the oven. For meats and all articles requiring a very hot oven, light the gas five minutes before using the oven, from three to four if a cool oven is called for.</p><p>To use gas economically, one must always keep in mind the capacity of a single burner. The gas must be lighted when you are ready to use it, and turned out the moment you have finished. Under such circumstances, taking also into consideration that it does not require time for replenishing, as an oil, coal or wood stove, and there is no dust or ashes to remove, gas is the cheapest of all fuels. In preparing a dinner on a gas stove, select vegetables that may be cooked in the oven, and meat cooked in the underneath oven or broiling chamber, or materials that may be cooked in a steam cooker on top of the stove on a single burner. By paying attention to details of this kind a gas range may be used, the necessary water heated for scullery and laundry purposes, at a cost of not over $10 per quarter; much cheaper than coal for the
same amount of work.</p><p>A sample dinner prepared at a minimum cost:<list><item>Cream of Pea Soup</item><item>Broiled Steak</item><item>Baked Potatoes</item><item>Scalloped Tomatoes</item><item>Salad</item><item>Mock Charlotte</item></list></p><p>First prepare the charlotte. In so doing, use one burner on the top of the. stove, allowing five minutes for its use. An hour before dinner time, light the oven burners; when the indicator registers 9, wash the potatoes, put them in a baking pan and in the oven on the grate. Prepare the scalloped tomatoes, stand them aside as they require but twenty minutes cooking. Trim and wipe the steak ready for broiling. It will require fifteen minutes, and the broiling chamber is already heated. Light a top burner for the pea soup, which will be made while you are broiling the steak, if canned peas are used; if fresh, allow fifteen minutes for the first boiling of the peas press them through a colander, and finish while the steak is broiling.</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=49"/>

In five minutes put the steak underneath. Now finish up the soup. Turn out the burner, the water in the under boiler will keep it sufficiently hot. The potatoes are done Take each one carefully in a napkin; press it until it is perfectly soft within the skin, being careful not to break the skin, and dish them on a folded napkin. Dish and season the steak. Turn out the oven burners at once. Place everything in the oven to keep warm while the soup is being served. The cooking of all this dinner, if carefully managed, will cost not more than five cents.</p><p>Let us observe for a moment the reverse of this meal. We will have boiled or mashed potatoes; these will require an extra burner. Select stewed tomatoes instead of baked. These will take another burner. The soup will take the third, and the oven will be lighted for twenty or twenty-five minutes for heating and broiling the steak. It can be seen at a glance that seven or eight cents will be required against the five cents in the first case. Large gas bills are not, as a rule, caused by the stove or the meter, but the lack of thought or knowledge of the cook.</p><p>Where long, slow cooking becomes necessary, as in the making of stock and the cooking of cereals, use the simmering burner, after the articles have first been brought to boiling point. On baking days where six or eight loaves of bread must be baked at one time, put four on the underneath grate and four on the upper grate. After the bread has been baking fifteen minutes change the upper for the under row; turn down the burners to the minimum and bake slowly after the loaves have all been nicely browned. When using the oven for baking purposes, it is wise to select a small roast or a steak , for the dinner, as these can be roasted or broiled underneath thus again making double use of the oven burners. When baking cakes or cinnamon bun, that require a sow fire, chicken or fricandeau may be cooked underneath. A slow fire is much the better roasting fire. In baking, light the oven burners least five minutes before putting the articles in the oven. Meats or poultry require a very quick oven Heat until the indicator points to 12; continue at full heat until the<pb n="40" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=52"/> meat is seared on the outside, then turn down the gas until the hand runs back to 8 and cook slowly fifteen minutes to each pound. For pastry the indicator should point to 10; bake at baking. Bread in square loaves does not require extreme heat. The indicator should register 8 during the entire baking. For large loaves, gradually increase to 9, at which point the baking will be finished. For angel food, sunshine and sponge cake, start at 6; increase the heat slowly for 20 minutes until it registers 8; finish cooking at this point. Three-quarters of an hour is the time allowed for the baking. For cakes containing butter, heat to 6 before putting in the cakes; after twenty minutes increase the heat to 8, and finish. Bake a cup, or pound cake at slow heat, register at 7, for two hours.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">TO BROIL STEAK</hd><p>Light the oven burners at least five minutes before the time for broiling. Allow twelve to fifteen minutes for a steak an inch and a half thick. When the rack and pan are hot, place the steak on the rack, and put it as near the flames as possible without having it touch. As soon as it is seared and brown on one side, turn, sear and brown on the other. Now turn again. Remove the rack three or four slides down, but do not reduce the heat. Cook for five minutes; turn the steak and broil for five minutes longer and it is ready to season and serve.</p><p>A steak properly broiled will be "done" throughout, rare and juicy, not raw or purple in the middle, as is usually the case over a coal fire. Broil chops the same as steak. For broiling or planking fish, heat the oven five minutes, and place the fish flesh side up; when nicely browned, turn clown the burners and cook slowly for a half hour. Fish cooked under the gas is most delicious.</p> 
<p>In these days good cooks no longer guess at oven temperatures. They have positive results; gas, as well as wear and tear on one's nerves, are saved. One knows when the oven is ready, how much to reduce the heat, and how to regulate until the<pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=53"/> baking is done. There is no opening or closing of the doors allowing the escape of the heat during baking. The temperatures given above are exclusively for gas cooking.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">BOILING</hd><p>It may seem presumptuous to suggest that few people know how to boil water, but such is the case. During my experience as a teacher, which extends over a period of twenty years, I can safely say that not more than fifty ladies applying for admission to my school have been able to tell what is meant by the "boiling of water," or the different temperatures at which it boils, and why, and what chemical changes take place during and after the boiling. We boil water in the kitchen for two purposes: for the cooking of the water itself frequently to remove dangerous germs, and for the purpose of cooking other materials. The average housewife?-I am speaking now of the masses?-has few conveniences for experimental examinations, hence she must take a great deal for granted. The boiling point, under ordinary atmospheric pressure (sea level), is 212&#176; Fahr.; this point changes according to the altitude. When bubbles form on the bottom of the kettle, come clear to the surface and rupture quietly without making an ebullition, the water is simmering. At this point the thermometer should register 180&#176; Fahr., and it is at this temperature that we cook meats and make soups. When the bubbles begin to form on the sides and bottom of the vessel and come toward the top of the water, there is a motion in the water, but it is not really boiling hot; it is simply giving back the atmospheric gases which have been absorbed within. It is only when the thermometer reaches 212&#176; Fahr. and the water is in rapid motion that it can be called boiling water, and the atmospheric gases still continue to be given off with the steam for a considerable time after the water has commenced to boil rapidly; in fact, it is difficult to determine when the last traces have been expelled. It is safe oppose, however, that ten minutes' boiling will free the water from its gases, make it tasteless and render it unfit for the making of tea, coffee or other light infusions of delicate materials. By filtering boiled water, allowing it to drop from<pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=54"/> an upper into a lower vessel, it will be aerated and assume its original flavor. Boiled water is flat. The mineral matter in this water, which is calcareous, is precipitated. Our tea-kettle, if not cleaned daily, becomes encrusted with these materials.</p><p>We speak of boiling meats, boiling eggs, boiling vegetables, but we know that these materials are much better when cooked in water below the boiling point. But it is very difficult to get ride of the terms "boiled." Boiled meat is not boiled at all, but is cooked far below the boiling point that the fibre may be softened and the meat made tender. The meat itself does not boil, even if the water surrounding it is boiling. Boil a piece of meat at full gallop for thirty minutes, after the meat has been thoroughly heated, plunge a thermometer into the centre of the meat, and to your surprise it will not register over 170&#176; Fahr. Meats baked in very hot ovens register about the same.</p><p>Boiling is one of the simplest and best methods of cooking the so-called inferior pieces of meat, and consists in plunging the whole piece into a large kettle of boiling water. The meat must be entirely covered, boiling rapidly for five minutes, the temperature of the water then lowered to 160&#176; or 180&#176; Fahr., and the cooking continued at this temperature. Some cooks lower the water to 130&#176;, especially for mutton.</p><p>Meat loses greater weight in the boiling than by any other process. The better pieces of meat, such as the round and shoulder, lose about twenty-five per cent., and such a piece as the brisket, being rich in fat, loses forty per cent. Four pounds of beef will lose one pound. Four pounds of mutton will lose fourteen ounces.</p><p>Salt meats that have already parted with a large portion of their juices must be thoroughly washed in cold water and put on to boil in cold water; the water in which they were boiled may be saved for other purposes. All water in which meats are boded should be saved for stock and sauces. For soups, start always with cold water.</p><p>All vegetables go over the fire in boiling water; there is no exception to this rule. Such as turnips, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts, after the first boil, must be cooked slowly in an uncovered kettle.</p><pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=55"/><p>Rice and macaroni boil rapidly, not that rapidly boiling water gives a greater degree of heat, but the motion washes apart or separates the particles or grains. Rice cooked slowly in a small quantity of water is heavy and unsightly.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">STEAMING</hd><p>Steaming is an admirable method of cooking tough meats or hams, fruit cakes, puddings and things requiring a long, moist heat. Modern housewives use for this purpose a "cooker" or sterilizer. The old-fashioned perforated steamer over a kettle of boiling water will, however, answer every purpose. Steaming requires a little longer time than boiling. Potatoes, rice, peas, beans, corn, squash, cucumbers and pumpkins may be steamed.</p><p>Materials never boil in a double boiler, nor are they steamed. Things cooked in a double boiler are cooked below boiling point. For making custards, scalding milk or cooking cereals, it is most advantageous, as it removes all danger of burning.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">ROASTING</hd><p>By this method the nutritive juices and the flavor extractives, are more thoroughly retained than by any other method of cooking. Roasting and broiling are practically the same, and mean to expose one side of the meat to the fire, while the other is exposed to the fresh air. The method is almost obsolete in this country, as conveniences for such cooking have gone out of date. In our hurried life such methods are too slow, except where the gauze door oven is used. Baking has almost entirely substituted the roasting of beef. Roasting most thoroughly and quickly seals the juices on the outside, forming a crust which acts as a barrier, preventing further escape of the juices. The meat loses less weight than by boiling, is richer and finer in flavor. Beef, mutton, game, turkeys or chickens in fact a meats with the exception of pork and veal have the best and highest flavor when cooked in this fashion. The loss of weight in roasting is due to the loss of water and fat, which amount about twenty per cent.</p><pb n="44" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=56"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">BAKING</hd><p>This is a method of cooking in the oven of a stove. It is by no means an inferior way of cooking meat, providing the basting is carefully done. We bake our bread, cake, potatoes and tomatoes, meats, poultry and game. Four pounds of beef will lose in baking one pound three ounces; four pounds of mutton will lose in baking one pound four ounces.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">STEWING OR FRICASSEEING</hd><p>This is really "boiling," in a sauce. After the meat has been browned either by throwing it into a hot pan or into a little hot fat, it is cooked in a brown sauce at a temperature of 180&#176; Fahr. If the mixture is allowed to boil hard during the cooking it will become tough and shriveled. When properly stewed the texture is soft and loose and readily breaks down under mastication. This is why we are told that stewed meats are easy of digestion. Stewing is the most economical method of cooking meats. There is practically no loss. The loss in weight is not 15 per cent., and what is lost to the meat is held in the sauce, so that really one gets a full return for each dollar spent.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">BRAISING</hd><p>Braising is a cross between boiling and baking, a method largely employed in France; hence we take for granted that it must be an economical way of cooking meats. It is best adapted to inferior pieces, those requiring long, slow cooking. A covered pan is employed for the purpose, and in this country is called a "roasting pan;" but we cannot "roast" in a covered pan. The meat is placed in the pan, the pan partly filled with stock or water, then closely covered and placed in a well heated oven. The meat browns even while the water in the pan is evaporating; tough or dense flesh, such as that found in old poultry or cattle illy fed, when cooked in this manner, is tender and palatable, hence more easy of digestion. It is also a choice method of cooking veal and pork. Flavor insipid meat, such<pb n="45" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=57"/> as veal, with bay leaf, carrots, onions and various herbs placed in the pan during the braising. The loss to the meat in cooking is held in the water or stock which is used for the
sauce.</p> 
<hd align="center" rend="bold">BROILING OR GRILLING</hd> 
<p>This is the same as roasting, applied to a smaller portion of meat. We broil or grill our steaks, chops, spring chicken and fish.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">FRYING</hd><p>By frying we mean cooking by immersion in hot fat at a temperature of 350&#176; to 380&#176; Fahr. There must be sufficient fat in the pan to wholly cover each article. We fry such things as croquettes, egg plant and oysters. This method is less injurious than sauteing. When fats are heated to a high temperature, fatty acids are developed, which greatly irritate the digestive organs. Fried meats are always to be avoided even by persons with strong digestion. They will in time produce disorders of the digestive tract.</p><p>The art of frying is little understood in the average household. The products of the frying pan are usually indigestible, greasy, unsightly and unpalatable. Fats over-heated, before the articles are fried, are most injurious. If too cool, foods are greasy and under-done. An article well fried will come from the fat as free from grease as though it had been cooked in water.</p><p>A croquette that will soil the fingers as it is taken from the fat is not fit for food. Fried oysters leaving their marks on the serving plate are certaintly not palatable or dainty. Oil is the best material for frying. "Ko-nut" or "Nut-ko," made from cocoanut, a cocoanut butter, is also excellent. The compounds sold under various names as cottosuet, cottolene and vegetole are mixtures of suet and cotton-seed oil, are wholesome and give better results than lard. Lard is last to be chosen, it absorbs easily, consequently is expensive. Foods fried in pure lard are greasy and rather offensive. All warmed-over foods, as croquettes and cecils, must be dipped in egg and rolled in<pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=58"/> bread crumbs before frying. The egg rich in albumin coagulates, forming a thin grease proof covering over the outside, as soon as they are put into the hot fat. Thus articles are cooked fat without taking up the fat. This fat, when cool, must be strained and put aside to use over and over again, as long as it lasts. Ten pounds of fat will last the entire winter and you may fry four or five times a week, if the digestion of the family will allow.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">SAUT&#233;ING</hd><p>This is cooking in a small quantity of fat. An omelet, lyon naise potatoes, hash brown potatoes are saut&#233;d, not fried. Butter is usually employed for this purpose, but is the poorest of all frying materials, as it decomposes at a very low temperature. Oil is more wholesome.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">LARDING</hd><p>By this we mean stitching a piece of meat with strips of fat salt pork. These strips are called "lardoons," and are usually two inches in length and an eighth of an inch in width. The "needle" used for the purpose is called a larding needle; instead of having an eye at the end, it has four slits which fold together as it is pulled through the meat.</p><p>Place the strip of fat pork down into the needle, take a stick as shown in the cut, pull the needle through the meat leaving a portion of the lardoon at each end. We lard sweet breads, game, poultry, veal and fillet of beef. It is not, however, at all necessary or obligatory that any of these shall be larded, but it is the ordinary method. People not using- pork simply omit that part of the recipe.</p><pb n="46" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=59"/>

The juices of meat are acid; hence it is undesirable to use either tin or iron; even after a thorough cleaning, they will impart an unpleasant odor, and spoil the flavor of the soup for the person with a delicate palate.</p> 
<p>An ordinary granite kettle with a closely fitting lid will answer every purpose. If you can afford a little more at first cost, the one with an outside copper bottom will last twice as long, and is really more desirable. The bottom being double prevents the rapid boiling which is always objectionable for clear soups. Have the kettle sufficiently large to hold the bones, the meat and the water, and leave a space, of at least four inches, from the top. This will allow of easy skimming. As the ordinary clear soup is made from bone and meat, rapid boiling clouds the soup, making a clear soup impossible, without clarification; hence the necessity for great care in making.</p><hd align="center">STRAINING</hd><p>An ordinary colander may be used for the first straining, and after this a pur&#233;e sieve.</p><p>For a perfectly clear or brilliant soup, a double cheesecloth is preferable to a flannel bag. The objection to flannel is that it holds the flavor or odor of the soup, and is rarely thoroughly cleansed; then at the next straining, it gives to the soup a stale. unpleasant flavor. Cheesecloth is easily cleansed; the fibre of cotton is more yielding than that of flannel.</p><p>Use always 
<emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water in making soups.</p><p>As all the nourishment of meat cannot be drawn out into the water, the meat from soups should be saved and used for such dishes as pressed meats, sandwiches and curries, where <pb n="48" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=62"/> added flavorings are pronounced. The water draws out the albumin, which coagulates and is removed from the top by skimming. It is the coagulation of all the albumin throughout the hot liquid, as it gradually comes to the surface, that clarifies the stock. This nourishment is lost both to the soup and meat, but the fibre remains undissolved. The salts or mineral matter have been dissolved in the water, taking the flavor and odor from the meat; hence made dishes with decided flavor only are palatable.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">SOUP</hd><p>Soups may be divided into four classes : Those containing considerable nourishment, as thick milk soups; the clear soups containing vegetables, moderately nourishing; the thin clear soups containing the stimulating elements of the beef, without nourishment, as stock, consomm&#233;, bouillon; and the cold fruit soups. Those of the last class are used only in the summer at the beginning of a luncheon, are rather heavy, and cannot be considered hygienic. Perfectly clear soups and those containing bits of vegetables are dinner soups; while the milk or so-called "cream" soups may be used for luncheon or supper where they form a part of the nourishment of the meal. In most well-to-do families, soup begins the dinner. As the dishes following are rich in food value, the soup need not necessarily be nutritious. Under such circumstances, a perfectly clear soup is desirable, the object being to draw into the stomach the digestive fluids before the entrance of solid food. But where a soup is to form the entire dinner, as it frequently does among the middle or laboring classes, it must contain sufficient meat and vegetable material to give the necessary nourishment. In France, among the country folk, the ordinary 
<emph rend="italic">pot-au-feu</emph> always palatable, nutritious and economical, and no one complains of being hungry immediately after, as is usually the case in this country, where "things" are strained out and too often thrown away.</p> 
<p>To repeat, water cannot dissolve the fibre of beef, which holds a large part of the nourishment. Clear soups are only <pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=63"/>

<p>While the fashion of having a dinner soup is confined to the few, the masses would follow, I am sure, if they knew the hygiene of the fashion.</p> 
<p>For clear soup, select either a plain stock, bouillon or consomm&#233;. The first may be made from fresh meat, or the bones from cooked meats. The latter method is recommended to those who wish to live well and economically.</p><p>Bouillon is a light clear soup served in cups at the beginning of a luncheon.</p><p>Consomm&#233; is the most expensive and the most tasty of all clear soups; it is always used as a dinner soup.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">STOCK</hd><p>Stock is the foundation of all the clear soups, and the very life and essence of all meat sauces.</p><p>To make a perfectly clear stock use a shin of beef, meat and bone in proportion of one pound of meat to a half pound of tone. Wipe it carefully with a damp cloth; cut the meat from the bone; and then into small blocks or pieces. Put into the stock kettle two tablespoonfuls of sugar and one sliced onion; stir over a hot fire until the onion and sugar brown and burn.

<emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water cover the kettle, bring slowly to boiling point and skim. Push the kettle now over a moderate fire where it will just bubble, not boil, for three hours. At the end of this time add one onion into which you have stuck twelve cloves, a bay leaf, a carrot, a few green tops of celery or a half teapoonful of celery seed, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover and simmer gently for another hour. These vegetables may be saved and used pur&#233;e. A wire vegetable ball is a convenience. Now strain the stock and stand it aside to cool. When cold remove every<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=66"/> particle of fat from the surface, and it is ready for use. If carefully made this will be clear, brown, transparent, and when cold a thick jelly. The meat that is strained from the stock must not be thrown away, but put aside for the making of pressed meats or curries.</p>

A half pint of cold roasted chicken with the carcass of the chicken will make sufficient gumbo for six persons. Crack the bones of the carcass; put them into the soup kettle with two quarts of cold water; bring to boiling point, skim, and push the kettle back where it will simmer for about two hours.

</table><p align="center" size="smaller">For table of fish in season see page 27</p><p>Fish belongs to the nitrogenous group of foods.</p><p>Builds and repairs muscular flesh and tissues.</p><p>Is digested principally in the stomach, proper.</p><p>The chemical analysis of fish has not been sufficiently accurate to make a table of composition at all reliable. The albuminoid matter in white fish, as cod, haddock and halibut, is in about the same proportion as in beef and mutton. The ratio of water in fish, flesh and fowl is also quite uniform; fish contain, however, more phosphorus, the active  fish, as trout and pickerel, containing the greater percentage. The amount of carbon depends largely upon the amount of fat the fish contain. White fleshed fish are, therefore, deficient in carbon. The fat is secreted and held in the liver. If you should ask an intelligent cook what vegetables to serve with boiled white fish, she would answer, potatoes and cucumbers or lettuce with French dressing, as they supply the wanting carbohydrates and fat. Pink fleshed fish, as salmon, catfish and sturgeon, have the fat dispersed throughout the body, and are in consequence more difficult of digestion, although alone they have a greater food value. From this we learn that the white fleshed fish are better for the delicate stomach, and that the dark or pink fish make a much better diet for the active man; and the more active fish will contain a greater amount of muscle-making food than their more indolent relations. Fish, on account of its density of fibre,<pb n="96" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=114"/> would not be recommended as a frequent diet for brain workers.</p><p>In foreign countries fish are caught in nets, kept alive in tanks of fresh water, weighed after they are purchased, and then killed. Under such circumstances fish are much more wholesome. Stale fish should be avoided, those kept in cold storage, as well as those frozen in blocks of ice. Better, by far, accept the fish that are in season during the different months of the year than to use one special sort, the year around.</p><hd align="center">TO PURCHASE FISH</hd><p>Examine the flesh, which should be firm, the scales closely adhering and of brilliant color, the eyes and gills bright and the flesh free from any unpleasant odor. Fish are poisonous if stale.</p><hd align="center">WHITE FLESHED FISH</hd><p>Heading this list stands cod, which being widely distributed along the northern coast, is easily accessible, hence its cheapness. The tongues, and sounds, the swimming bladders, are frequently used as a special dish.</p><p>Isinglass is a gelatin or glue made from these swimming or air bladders. Cod liver oil is expressed from the cod's liver.</p><p>Cod is an admirable boiling fish, and may be fried in slices or fillets, but is never used for baking.</p><p>Haddock, closely allied to the cod, is less desirable on account of the enormous weight of the head, which is waste; and while it sells at a low price, is not always cheap. Both cod and haddock are to be had throughout the year, but are truly in season from October to June.</p><p>Halibut is the largest fish coming to our market. Young halibut weighing from ten to fifteen pounds are sold whole under the name of "chicken halibut;" the larger halibut are cut into slices and sold at twenty-five cents per pound; being solid flesh, without waste, is economical.</p><p>Flounders, admirable boiling fish, are flat, a little larger than the English sole, and are frequently served for the same. They have, however, coarser flesh, and are not so fine in flavor. These may be also made into fillets and fried or served 
<emph rend="italic">au gratin.</emph></p><pb n="97" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=115"/><p>Perhaps next in order comes the white fish of the great lakes, one of our very best fish when used fresh from the water and when planked are much better and much more delicate than shad. They are also an exceedingly good boiling, baking or broiling fish.</p><p>Along the coasts we have endless varieties of good fish blue fish, sheep's-head, weak fish, sea bass, porgies. All these may be planked, broiled, or boiled. Blue fish are exceedingly good when baked.</p><p>As we go South on the coast, we find the red snapper, and along the Gulf, the pompano. This, without exception, is the king of all fish. When properly boiled it is free from the general odor and flavor of fish, tastes more like the most delicious young chicken. Red snapper is also a fine boiling fish, but too large for a small family.</p><p>Spanish mackerel are best broiled. They are found also in the Southern waters, and command a much higher price than the ordinary blue, smooth skinned mackerel; the latter are usually salted.</p><p>Mackerel are in season during the summer months, the best usually coming in from about the first to the middle of June. They keep in good condition until the first of September.</p><p>Shad come from the sea up into the fresh water rivers for spawning early in the spring. Our first shad come from the southern waters in February or March; next from up the Susquehanna and Delaware. They are in season from the first of February until the middle of June. They are best planked; are very good, however, broiled, but should never be fried, as they already contain too much fat. Frying makes them more difficult of digestion.</p><p>Bony fish, as herring and porgies, are usually rolled in egg and bread crumbs and fried. They are cheap, but very full of bones. Boneless salted herring makes an exceedingly nice relish for the beginning of a lunch.</p><p>Eels and catfish, fish without scales, must be taken from exceedingly clean water to be wholesome. They are skinned, dipped in egg and bread crumbs and fried.</p><p>Salmon, the most prized of all, is one of the pink fleshed<pb n="98" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=116"/> fish, of fine flavor. It may be sliced and broiled, or planked; boiled whole or in slices, and served with sauce Hollandaise, is the most elegant of dinner fish.</p><p>Cod's head and shoulders boiled is also a fine dinner dish. Next to this comes the rock or rock bass. Salmon, of course, is fine; but the white fleshed fish are preferable where heavy meats follow.</p>

They are to be had from July to Sep-tember. When a <ingredient>crab</ingredient> or <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> outgrows its shell, it has the power of splitting down the back, drawing its hands, as it were, out of the "sleeves'' or claw shells, retiring until the new shell becomes hardand protective. It is under these conditions that we have soft shell <ingredient>crabs;</ingredient> not the most hygienic food that one can possibly take, as all animals during this period of "moult-ing" are more or less in a state of disease. However, we have trained our artificial palates to like the flavor; hence they are in demand and at a large price. The new shell becomes hardin about three days, which accounts for the always short supply. These must be cooked actually alive. While we throw <ingredient>lobsters</ingredient> into <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> to kill them, we pull apart the soft shell <ingredient>crab</ingredient> in a live condition, and put it into the frying pan while it is dying. And still we are civilized.</p><p>To prepare, lift the shell and remove the spongy fingers or gills from both sides. Then put your thumb nail under the point of the "apron," and pull it off. The apron is the small loose shell running to a point or round in the middle of the under shell.

<chapter class1="meatfishgame"><pb n="135" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=157"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">MEATS</hd><p>Scientists in general agree that animal proteids yield more easily to the digestive apparatus of man than vegetable pro-teids. We might correctly call flesh a partly digested food, the animal having converted the vegetable tissues into animal tissues, which are exceedingly well adapted to the growth and maintenance of the organic structure of the human body. And, in our rapid method of living, it seems to suit better than the same amount of vegetable food.</p><p>We in this generation find it difficult to digest the legumin-ous vegetables (peas, beans and lentils) which contain the pro-teid materials useful in the building of muscles and tissues; hence the increased demand for meat. Primitive man found no difficulty whatever in building muscle, brain and nerve from these coarse vegetable foods; but it must be borne in mind that his mental activity was far less than ours. Perhaps his bodily vigor was more intense; but even this is doubtful if we sum up the hours of modern labor from the beginning to the end of life. The intense excitement and energy needed for the chase was of short duration compared to the working hours of the laborer of the twentieth century. Meats, in proper proportion then, are necessary to rapid development. I must contend, however, that a well selected vegetable diet will give health, bodily vigor and mental strength to those who live rationally. Opinions to the contrary are given by those experimenters who have for years lived on a mixed diet, largely meat, and quickly changed, for the sake of experimental purposes, to four or six weeks' vegetable diet, from which they make their report. A radical change of this kind must necessarily provoke irregulari-ties. Such experiments are of little value; they really prove nothing. Observe carefully those who have always lived largely on meat, those on a mixed diet of proper proportions, and the vegetarian, all occupying the same positions in the<pb n="136" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=158"/> world, simply choosing different foods for the same purpose. Such observations are of value. The vegetarian is quite equal in strength to either of the others and most likely freer from disease. The amount of proteid matter in plants is far less than in animals, except in the leguminous seeds. This proves at once that in a vegetable diet the right sort of vegetables must be used. For instance, it would be folly to substitute potatoes for meat, or any succulent vegetable for meat; peas, beans and lentils, the pulse tribe, alone will give the necessary amount of nitrogenous (muscle-making or tissue-building) foods. We have followed the practice?perhaps without knowing exactly why?of serving pork, which is a heat-producing food, with our beans, muscle-making food. Then, on the other hand, we serve potatoes with beef. Such combinations are wise. It would be foolish, indeed, to serve pork and potatoes. The vegetarian selects beans and potatoes, and thereby gets a greater amount of nitrogen, a larger proportion of muscle-making food, than from beef and potatoes. The out-door laborer, with an abund-ance of pure air, would in all wisdom select beans rather than beef. To the indoor laborer, however, beef would be prefer-able. It would suit his sluggish digestive apparatus much better; he could, without doubt, get a far greater amount of nitrogen with less expenditure of energy, from the beef. The proteid matter of animals and vegetables does not differ essen-tially in chemical composition. The remaining constituents, however, show the widest diversity. There is an entire absence of starch in animal food. In flesh we find muscular fibre with the blood vessels, nerves and connective tissues, and a variable proportion of water and fatty matter, the latter according to the method of keeping and feeding the animals. With one exception, the animals we use as foods are granivorous, and according to my opinion the hog?the exception?if he be used at all as food, should be fed upon vegetable substances.</p><p>The ratio of water in fish, flesh and fowl is about the same. If a piece of lean beef be dried in the sunshine or by artificial methods, it will shrink, diminishing in bulk, losing its natural water. Four pounds of this flesh will leave but one pound of dried flesh, losing, as you see, 75 per cent, of water. It is said<pb n="137" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=159"/> by many experimenters that the connective tissue of beef is more difficult of digestion than the ordinary fibre; hence tough meat, caused by the development of these, must be cooked with moist heat to soften them, or ground thoroughly in a meat grinder, to tear them apart, before cooking. The fibre of meat, if washed free from other material, can easily be seen under a microscope. Take a small piece of lean beef, wash it carefully through several cold waters, and you will have left a mass of muscular or fibrous tissue, insoluble in alcohol, and only slightly softened when cooked in water. Beef is looked upon as being more nutritious than mutton, while mutton is the more easily digested. We must take into consideration, however, that mutton contains more fat. To some, this would be objectionable, as cooked fat is rather difficult of emulsifi-cation. Fats are wholesome foods, but must be taken at the temperature of the body; hence the fats of meat, which must necessarily be cooked to be free from danger, are not desirable foods. About one-fourth of the dry substance of ordinary butchers' meat is fat; and this, you will remember, represents heat food, taking the place of starch in our vegetable foods, although it produces in the body a greater amount of heat and less fat. Moleschott says that "fat is the first material in the body to be burned for the production of animal heat." People of the arctic region live largely upon blubber, which produces the great bodily heat necessary in those cold climates, while in the southern warm climates, little fat is required. Starches and sugars have hydrogen and oxygen in the same proportions as they exist in water, burn more slowly, producing less heat. It is said that explorers in temperate or cold climates who have been obliged to live on wild animals and game (these, you will remember, are quite free from fat) are obliged to take with them oil, or now and then use some form of animal fat, as bacon, to keep up the balance of their dietary. Fowls contain less fat, as a rule, than beef or mutton, unless they are fed to excess, or "spayed," or castrated, as in the case of the "capon," or where they are simply crammed as are the geese of Strassburg, to make the fattened livers. The latter method, however, produces diseased<pb n="138" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=160"/> flesh. Young animals, as veal, lamb and young chickens, contain less fat than those fully grown. Fish vary to a great extent as to the amount of fat present in the flesh. The whitings, tur-bot, sole, white fish, pike, flounder, halibut, haddock, contain less fat than salmon, mackerel, sturgeon, eels or shad. The herring is a fish almost by itself; it contains much more fat "in season" than when it is "out of season." Sturgeon contains the greatest amount of fat; salmon perhaps ranks second.</p><p>Dried meats are those that have parted with most of their natural water. In this condition they are said to be "preserved," and, if protected from the air, will keep a long time. They consist principally of nitrogenous materials known as myosin, fibrin, albumin, gelatin and fat, the proportion of which is variable. All albuminous or nitrogenous foods are more easily digested uncooked; but cooking becomes necessary to remove the danger of disease germs; hence it is desirable that meat shall be thoroughly heated. The American fashion of serving meat "rare" or in a rather purple condition, is certainly objectionable. A rule to be remembered is that all white meats must be thoroughly cooked. Red meats may be served a little underdone. This does not mean that the blood must run from them as they are carved, but that they must be pink, juicy and tender. Veal, lamb and young chicken require a greater time for digestion than mature animals of the same kind. Of these, lamb and young chicken are perhaps least objectionable.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">TABLE OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSES</hd><p>In summing up, consider the comparative analyses of meats in common use. It will be noticed that the water decreases as the fat in the meat increases; and that in some cases, in the same animal, it affects also the mineral matter or salts. For instance, in lean mutton, the mineral matter is 4.8; in fat mutton, 3.5.</p><p>When meat is recommended as an article of diet, it must form only one-fifth, at most one-fourth, of a well-balanced dietary. We have simply recommended it as a better form of nitrogenous food for persons of sedentary habits than a purely vegetable diet. These analyses have been taken from various books of reference, Yeo, Pavy, Church and Letherby.</p><pb n="139" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=161"/>

Avoid beefwith yellow fat; it usually denotes an old and ill-fed animal. The lean flesh of such meat is tough, rich in water, and is rarely palatable even when carefully cooked. A "spayed" heifer from four to six years of age gives the very finest of beef. Second comes the steer or bullock which has been allowed to remain in our western fields until four or five years old, then quickly fattened and killed while in a perfectly healthy condition. The working ox, cow and bull do not give us choice meat. In the first, the muscles have been hardened by work, making a coarse grained flesh, ligaments and muscle, weighing less than good beef according to the amount of bones. A cow, as a rule, is not sold for beef until she is too old to milk; hence the flesh is shriveled, tough and unpalatable. The flesh of a bull is usually dark in color, tough and stringy, while the fat is strong in flavor and golden in color.</p><p>Animals whose flesh is to be used as food for man should be carefully fed and properly killed; the flesh put at once into cold storage and "hung" until the rigor mortis has passed. It is a well known fact that immediately after death the muscles become rigid and tense, a condition due to the spontaneous coagulation of the myosin of the muscular fibrin. Its duration varies greatly in different animals and under different conditions; do not eat the flesh of animals until this has passed away. "Hang" all animals and birds. Use fish as soon as they come from the water.</p><p>It was supposed, in the earlier days, that mutton required a longer "hanging" time than beef, game still longer and that poultry might with impunity be used the same day on which it was killed. After experimenting carefully, we find that barn yard fowls require hanging from twenty-four to thirty hours. If an animal is cooked before rigor mortis has "set in," it may possibly be tender, but certainly has a very unpleasant flavor. In very warm countries, however, where meat cannot be kept<pb n="141" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=163"/>

Roasting, grilling or broiling means to expose one side of the meat to a hot fire while the other is toward the fresh, cold air. Our forefathers roasted and broiled meat before an open fire. The beef of old England is still roasted, but in this country we almost invariably bake rather than "roast." It requires less attention and is more convenient. No matter in what way the meat is cooked, the object is the same?to thoroughly cook and at the same time retain the juices, and make the meat tender and well flavored. By exposing the meat to an intense heat, the juices on the outside are coagulated, forming a covering or crust which prevents the further escape of the juice, and retains the flavor of the meat. If properly cooked, a piece of beef may be well done and still juicy. Dry meatis always the result of poor cooking.</p><p>Different pieces of meat require different methods of cooking to bring about the best results. For instance, parts of the animal toughened by use or motion, as the round and shoulder, require moist heat to soften the fibre and connective tissue. It would be very unwise and extravagant to purchase the same sort of meat for roasting that one would use for stewing.</p><p>The diagram has been marked by one of the leading butchers in Philadelphia. The division will not, of course, correspond to the cutting in all cities of the United States, but will give the housewife a very good idea of the general division of beef. In the west, the animal is divided into halves at the first rib, one long standing rib being taken off with the hind quarter. This is well for the butcher, but bad for the housewife. In Boston, the division is just a little different from that in New York and Philadelphia. By a careful study of the whole animal (for the animals that go to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and the west have the same number of ribs), one -will get a closer idea of the different conditions of meat in the various parts of the animal.</p><pb n="142" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=166"/><p>For moist cookery such as stews, en casserole, or in any fashion where water is used, select the round (19), either upper or under. For boiling, bolar (I2) or round (I9) or the veiny piece of the rump (I8). The flank steak (I6) for rolled steak, mock fillet, steak a la Flamande or beefsteak pie. For the cheap stews, I3 and I8. For beef a la mode in a large family, a thick slice of the round (I9) is usually selected. In a smaller family the bolar piece (I2) is more desirable. In markets where the upper and under round are sold divided, the under round is chosen for a small family, although the upper is more tender, but a good slice would be too heavy. For soups or stock the shin and leg are best. The shin being smaller, requires but five quarts of cold water, while the leg requires seven, so the difference in price is due to the difference in size, one being as good as the other. The sticking piece (2) naturally contains more nourishment than almost any other part of the animal, as at this place the animal is bled; hence this piece is best for beef tea, beef extract, mince meat and beef loaf. The ox cheek (I) is not used to any great extent in this country; but in England it gives to the laboring man many a good dinner. It is cheap and nutritious, good boiled and served with vegetables. The neck (3) may also be used for stewing or braising with vegetables, but as one must take a large amount of bone with little lean beef it is extravagant for a small family, and is only good where long, slow cooking is employed, as in soups or stews. The second and third chucks (4) are used for roasting or baking. This, however, would be economical only in an exceedingly large family, as one must take a tremendous weight to get the thickness necessary for a good roast. This is also true of 5. The standing ribs are 6, 7 and 8. These differ from the chuck ribs in that they have more compact flesh. You will notice in 5 a little piece of cartilage coming near the edge of the meat, separating a thin outside layer from the main portion of the meat. As you go on into 4, this cartilage is hardened into bone and forms a portion of the shoulder blade. For this reason thechuck ribs are cheaper than standing ribs, although the meat is desirable and perhaps just as tender. Standing ribs carve to greater advantage.

For a small family 8; the meat is more compact and weight less for the size; two ribs make an exceedingly nice roast weighing from five to six pounds. If the butcher tops after weighing it, have him send the "top" home to use for deviled ribs or a braise, two of the nicest of the cheap dishes. Fifteen represents the loin, the choice, tender part of the animal. It must be borne in mind that an animal weighing eight hundred to a thousand pounds when dressed, will yield only about fifty pounds of loin, rarely ever more than sixty, hence this portion is very high in price. On the under side is the fillet or tenderloin, tender because it is shielded by the backbone on top, the mass of kidney fat underneath. The meat is without exercise, the muscles are soft, hence we have "tenderloin.' The outside nearest the skin gives us the "sirloin" steak served at the average first-class hotel, and to which we frequently refer as the 'back" of the loin. From the loin we get our "porterhouse" or "sirloin" steaks. In Philadelphia I7 is the rump, in New York the sirloin; it contains desirable steaks for broiling. The aitch or pin bone (22) is a desirable Toast in a large family, the proportion of bone to meat being always the same, makes it an extravagant "small" roast. The plate (9) and the brisket (IO) are best for corning, as here we get the "streak of fat" and a "streak of lean," always desirable in boiled corn beef. The butt end of the shoulder and the butt end of the brisket or clod (II and I3) are not desirable pieces, but may be used for stews and soups.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">TO ROAST</hd><p>To roast meat place the joint on a hook in a tin kitchen in front of an open fire. In Philadelphia and other cities where bricked-in ranges are used, the large front door is dropped. The fire must be clear and red. Or it may be hung in front of a wood fire, or in front of a charcoalfire, or better still in the underneath, or broiling chamber of a gas stove. Beef cannot be roasted in the oven of a coal stove unless it has a gauze door. We bake in an "oven." The fire must be clear and hot at first to sear the outside quickly; then lower the temperature to 3000<pb n="144" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=170"/> Fahr.; cook for fifteen minutes to each pound. The time varies where the roast is small. A five-pound roast will be put before the fire at a temperature of about 4000 Fahr., turned until the outside is quickly seared, the temperature then reduced to 3000 Fahr. Roast for one hour. It takes longer accordingly for a large roast, as it is more difficult for the heat to penetrate to the very centre. Add salt when the meat is nearly done; never add it at first; as it draws out the juices and toughens the meat. This you may prove by experiment. Put a piece of meat on a plate and sprinkle it thickly with salt. Put an unsalted piece on another plate and stand them both in a dry place for an hour. It will be noticed that the plate holding the salted meat is filled with the juices of the meat, while the other plate is comparatively dry. Sear the outside of meat previous to the salting. As the fat begins to melt and drip, catch it in a dripping pan and baste it frequently over the meat. This also helps to close the pores on the outside and makes the meat juicy and tender. Do not baste with water, as it softens the outside, allowing the juices to escape.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">TO ROAST IN A GAS STOVE</hd><p>Light the oven burners five minutes before putting in the meat. Place the broiling rack with its pan underneath as near the floor of the stove as possible. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, draw out the pan, place the meat flesh side up. As soon as this is brown and is nicely seared, turn, sear on the other side, and continue until the whole outside has been thoroughly seared. Now turn down the lights to the minimum and roast fifteen minutes to each pound, turning and basting every ten minutes. If you have a gauze door at the bottom of your gas stove close it, otherwise leave the door partly open or the oven may become too hot; there is danger of the fat catching fire. When partly done dust the fleshy portion with salt and pepper, and baste immediately. If the oven seems too hot as the roasting goes on, turn out the back burner; you will have sufficient heat to finish.</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=171"/>

Put a pan underneath to catch the dripping. Sear quickly at 4000 Fahr., and then cook slowly at 240 ? Fahr., basting frequently. Dust with salt and pepper when partly done. If you have an oven without the rack, proceed precisely the same as when baking in an ordinary oven. The meat will, however, be roasted, as the gauze door will allow a current of fresh air to pass through without chilling ? the oven.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">TO BAKE BEEF</hd><p>Under all circumstances, no matter whether with gas, wood, coal, or oil, the oven must be heated to at least 4000 Fahr. before putting in the meat. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, place it in a shallow baking pan, bone side down; dust it lightly with pepper. Put a teaspoonful of salt in one corner of the pan, and sufficient water to just cover the bottom. This will prevent the scorching of the pan while the meat is searing, and will evaporate in a few minutes. As soon as the meatis thoroughly crusted, close the drafts of the stove, cooling off the oven to 2400 Fahr. Baste the meat at once, and every ten minutes during the baking, which will be fifteen minutes to each pound. In about a half hour the bottom of the pan will be covered with melted fat; use this for basting; do not add more water. If the meat is lean and without fat, it is better to baste it with two or three tablespoonfuls of extra fat or dripping which you have saved. When the meat is done, dish it on a hot platter; pour from the pan all the fat, with the exception of four tablespoonfuls, keeping the brown sediment in the pan. To this add two rounding tablespoonfuls of flour;mix until smooth and add hastily a pint of stock or water. Put the pan over the fire, and stir constantly until the mixture boils; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet and a half saltspoonfnl of pepper. Strain into the gravy boat, and send at once to the table. This sauce will be a rich, dark brown, perfectly free from floating fat. The method of baking is precisely the same, no matter what sort of stove is used.</p><p>A gas oven should be lighted from eight to ten minutes 10<pb n="146" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=174"/> before placing the meat; the oil stove oven, equally long. Place the meat on the rack at least four inches from the bottom of the oven in the two latter stoves. Take notice that you are to baste the meat with the fat that melts and drips to the bottom of the pan, which is usually called dripping. Do not add water to the pan from time to time, as it softens the outside, allowing the juices to escape. The best piece of meat from a selected animal, put into a pan with water, covered and put into a moderately heated oven, will be tasteless, dry and stringy. Do not bake or roast tough or inferior pieces; use them for braising, where water can be used. Pork and veal must be baked much longer than beef, mutton or poultry.</p><p>I observe that country people depend largely upon pork for their meat, and really prefer it, as it has more flavor. This is true according to the common methods of cooking. Pork will stand long cooking in a slow heat, while beef, to be good, must be quickly seared and cooked without water. Slow cooking intensifies the flavor of pork and entirely destroys the flavor of beef.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">BOILED BEEF</hd><p>For this use a brisket, the bolar piece or round. Put the trimmings and suet of the meat> into a large kettle; when the fat has tried out, throw in the meat and turn it quickly until the outside is thoroughly seared. Remove the crackling from the fat, and cover the meat with boiling water, bring quickly to boiling point and boil rapidly for five minutes. Push it on the back part of the stove where it cannot again possibly boil, but will simmer at 1600 Fahr.?fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. One hour before the meat is done, add a tablespoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. When done, dish, garnish with cress or carefully boiled cabbage, and send at once to the table. The liquor in which the  meat was boiled may be saved for stock, or a portion of it made into brown sauce to serve with the meat</p><p>Cold, boiled beef may be served plain, cut into thin slices, or made into boudins, croquettes, cecils or meat and potato roll.</p><pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=175"/>

</recipe><hd rend="bold" align="center">MUTTON</hd><p>Mutton, like beef, is divided first into halves; then each half into hind and fore quarters. The hind quarter is sub-divided into a leg and loin, and the fore quarter into head, neck, shoulder, rack and breast. The saddle of mutton comprises the two loins cut from the dividing line between 4 and 6 back to the rump. It embraces the whole upper back portion of the sheep and is considered the most elegant of roasts. Mutton is much better if "hung" at least ten days. In the winter this can be done in any cool, dry place; in the summer it must be in "cold storage" or a refrigerator. The flesh of good mutton should be bright red in color, with fat firm and white; and the fatter the mutton the more tender the leaner parts. Good Southdown mutton is considered the best. For baking or roasting select the saddle, or the rack, 4, or loin, 6, or shoulder, 3, or the leg, 8. The best cooks, however, agree that the leg and shoulder are spoiled when not boiled. The neck-makes the best and the cheapest piece for stewing, pillau and broths of all kinds. The head may be used the same as a calf's head for soups and stews and is always one of the ingredients in haggis.</p><p>French chops are taken from rack, 4.</p><p>Loin chops come from 6. Both of these are broiled.</p><p>For plain boiling, the leg is first choice, the shoulder the second. Many epicures, however, prefer the shoulder to the leg.</p><pb n="164" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=198"/><p>The feet or legs of the sheep from the upper part of the hoof to the knee joints are known as the "sheep's trotters," and are used for jellies and pickling, "soused."</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">LAMB</hd><p>Lamb is the young of mutton. Spring lamb being much smaller than mutton is divided into halves and quarters only, and is sold and cooked in these quantities. The "fore" quarter is considered the better. The very early lamb is called "house lamb." The "lamb chops" sold in our markets are chops from young sheep, sometimes from small thin mutton, not spring lamb. Serve with lamb, mint sauce, peas, asparagus and new potatoes with cream sauce.</p>

Young veal is not only unwholesome, but frequently dangerous; is always known by the small tender or flexible bones,the flesh has a bluish tinge and is soft and flabby. The loin, shoulder, fillet and breast are best for roasting, or baking. The knuckle, the lower part of the leg, the neck, and bony pieces are used for stocks, stews and pies. The feet  for jelly; the head for soup and entrees. Any method requiring long, slow, moist cooking is to be preferred. Plain baked or roasted veal is more difficult of digestion than veal boiled.

</recipe><hd rend="bold" align="center">PORK</hd><p>While this animal must be classed with meats, the fat and lean flesh are very different from the fat and lean flesh of other animals. The texture of the lean pork corresponds more nearly to veal, while that of the fat is loose and more easily digested than the fat of other animals. Do not misunderstand. Cooked fats are universally to be condemned and the fat of pork, while it is easily digested in the raw state and more easily digested in the cooked state than other fats, is not to be recommended as a desirable food.</p><p>When it becomes necessary to add fat in greater quantities to our daily food, it is by far better to select a variety of fats that may be used uncooked, as butter,cream,olive oil and the fatty nuts. While butter and cream are liable to animal contamination, they are much more easily digested than cooked fats.</p><p>To repeat, the cooking of fats, which is necessary with the fat of animals to remove the danger of diseased germs, decomposes the fats, producing fatty irritant acids that irritate the mucous lining of the digestive tract.</p><p>The lean flesh of pork requires, even when carefully cooked, five hours for perfect digestion. If a man of sedentary habits uses nitrogenous foods of this kind, his stomach is rarely ever at rest, hence, it would give out at an early period of life; in fact,<pb n="182" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=222"/> it would have finished its power of digestion or it would have lived its life at an early age. It is not the number of years that complete one's life; one person may accomplish more in forty than another in eighty years, so the period of life must be rated according to the amount of energy expended and not the number of years actually lived.</p><p>Palatability of pork induces many unthinking people to eat it frequently and in large quantities. Pork eating people are, as a rule, inclined to indigestion. Breakfast bacon is more digestible than any other form of fatty meat; this is due to its preparation, but even breakfast bacon must be eaten with care, once in a while and in small quantities.</p><p>Pork containing more fat than the flesh of other animals is frequently placed with the carbonaceous, heat and energy foods, rather than with the muscle and tissue building foods. For this reason with beans (muscle making) we use pork, (heat producing); we do not serve beef with beans, both are muscle builders; but beef and potatoes, pork and beans.</p><p>According to my way of thinking, the hog, no matter how well fed, has little place on the well regulated table of thinking people. Granting that the fat is more easily digested than the fat of other animals, the lean flesh is dense, difficult of digestion and must be overcooked to be at all safe. Life is too short to spend it in digesting pork. Better by far take nitrogen in a more easily digested form and fats less liable to contamination.</p>

<chapter class1="meatfishgame"><hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">POULTRY AND GAME</hd><hd rend="bold" align="center">POULTRY</hd><p>Under this heading we shall consider the ordinary barnyard fowls?turkeys, chickens, ducks, geese and guinea fowls, also tame pigeons. These may be said to be in season during the greater part of the year, and next to the mammals are the most important of the meat diet. They belong to the nitrogenous or muscle-making foods, lacking, however, the stimulating quality of the red meats. The ratio of water is about the same as in beef and mutton. The fat is not stored throughout the lean flesh, as in the larger domestic animals, but in parts of the body. In overfed chickens it accumulates over and through the intestines, while in turkeys we find an additional layer underneath the skin of the breast.</p><p>Guinea fowls, chickens, and pigeons are best adapted to the delicate stomach.</p><p>Turkeys are, as a rule, well fed, carefully cleaned and come to the markets dry picked, with their heads and feet on, an exceedingly good way of marketing all kinds of poultry. When poultry is unduly fattened and there is a layer of fat underneath the skin, the meat, its depth not being great, becomes during cooking saturated with overheated fat, which is apt to disagree with delicate stomachs. For this reason ducks and geese are not so desirable as fowl. The greater the amount of fat, the less lean me and the more expensive our nitrogen, hence, overfattened fowls are less nutritious, less easy of digestion and more expensive.</p><p>Guinea fowl is a sort of cross between a wild bird and a domestic fowl, is lean, nutritious and easy of digestion; the meat is dark and rich in flavor.</p><p>Osmozone, that constituent which gives odor, flavor and color to meats, is found in smaller quantities in fowls than in red meats, For this reason Beaumont says that "white meat is <pb n="187" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=227"/> more difficult of digestion and less attractive than red meat; it is, however, less stimulating."</p><p>Spring chickens contain less nourishment than full grown fowls. They are used for broiling and panning, and are served as a delicate, appetizing morsel rather than a true food.</p><p>Barnyard fowls should be cooped for at least six days before killing. This does not mean to huddle ten or fifteen chickens in a small coop and feed anything near at hand. They must have a clean, good space, and be well fed on corn for at least five days, then for twenty-four hours before killing, on skimmed milk or soft boiled rice. The night before, give them plenty of water, no food. In this way the "crop" will be entirely empty, the intestines clean, the dark almost as light as the white flesh, and both will have a clean, sweet and delicious flavor.</p><p>Too often our common fowl has the meat so impregnated with unsuitable and offensive food, that the educated palate must reject it. The flesh of all animals is more or less flavored by food; for instance, a "celery fed" duck commands a higher price than one fed on corn; the canvas-back and the red-head ducks swim side by side down the water, the first eating the roots of the so-called "wild celery," which are rich in flavor, the latter taking the tops left floating on the water; as a result the canvas-back ducks are so impregnated with this desirable flavor that they retail at from two to three dollars a pair, while their close companions, the red-heads, are sold at a dollar. Rhode Island turkeys bring twice as much as the ordinary turkeys, simply because they are fed on a special food which imparts to the flesh a desired flavor.</p><p>All fowls raised for food purposes should have clean food and plenty of cold water.</p><hd align="center">HOW TO KILL A FOWL.</hd><p>To kill, stick them with a sharp knife through the jugular vein; this is best done by opening the mouth and cutting it on the inside of the neck. Hang them at once, by the feet, that they may bleed freely. Pick while they are warm, taking care not to tear the skin. Do not make any gashes in the flesh; do not cut off the head or feet.</p><pb n="188" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=228"/><p>It is always objectionable to scald poultry for picking purposes; it is a lazy way of getting off the feathers. Scalded chickens spoil quickly; scalding warms and frequently cooks the outside flesh. If then the intestines are not taken out for several days, and the meat improperly cooled, the flesh is unfit for eating, and extremely liable to cause ptomaine poisoning.</p><p>To prepare poultry for market, after picking, dip the feet into boiling water up as far as what may be called the "knee joint." Cut or loosen the skin around the joint and pull it off as you would turn off a glove, wrong side out. This will leave the feet perfectly clean, so that they may be used for stock and other purposes. Tie the feet together and wrap the neck as shown in the cut. Personally I should like such a chicken wrapped at once in oil paper to prevent contaminations from dust and handling.</p><hd align="center">HOW TO SELECT A FOWL.</hd><p>In selecting a chicken, choose one with firm flesh, feet and legs soft and free from scales, wings and the end of the breast bone limber, and with a sufficient amount of fat to make the chicken plump, but not enough to increase its weight; avoid old hens, especially those with tremendous bulk at the end of the breast bone?they are expensive, even at half price, as the intestines, fat and eggs they contain will weigh two pounds, and the flesh is neither well flavored nor tender. The end of the breast-bone remains cartilage until the chicken is about one year old; if this is pliable it denotes a young chicken. As a chicken grows older, the point become sharp and hard, and it is really a "fowl;" when exceedingly hard, it denotes an old fowl.</p><p>A "chicken" is a fowl under nine months old. A "pullet" is a young hen less than a year old. "Broilers" are spring chickens, chickens about four or five months old. "Fowl" is a term used to designate a chicken or rooster from a year and a half to two years old. A capon, a castrated cock or "spayed" hen, stands at the very head of domestic fowls. Their growth is rapid, their meat tender and delicious, and as they always command a high price, they are much better cared for than ordinary<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=229"/>

They have the tenderness of very young chickens, with the rich flavor of maturity.</p><hd align="center">HOW TO DRAW AND TRUSS A FOWL.</hd><p>These directions will answer equally well for chicken or turkey, After the "fowl" has been picked or as it comes to you from the market, hold it over a burning gas jet or over a little burning alcohol or alcohol lamp, to carefully singe off the long, hair-like feathers. Unfold the wings so that they will be properly singed. If obliged to use paper, select a piece of manilla, twist it rope-like, place it in a coal scuttle or baking pan, light it, and hold the fowl over the flame, turning until it is well singed. Do not allow the soot or carbon to be deposited on the turkey, as it spoils both the appearance and flavor of the flesh. As soon as the fowl is singed, put it into a pan of cold water, wash the skin thoroughly, then rinse with clean waterand wipe dry. With a cleaver cut off the head, leaving a long neck. To remove the feet, cut the skin at the side of the leg, running the knife lightly over the top; bend the leg back until the "sinews" on top are exposed; then with a wooden skewer or strong fork loosen them one by one and pull them out. To do this, grasp the upper part of the leg, holding it firm, until you loosen the ligaments. In this way they will come out perfectly clean without tearing the flesh. Now, cut through the tough muscle at the joint, exposing the ligaments on the under side, and grasping the flesh of the leg again, draw these out, one at a time. Then cut through the tough muscle at the back. If properly done you will have taken out five sinews from the upper side, and two from the under. After removing the second leg turn the fowl on the breast, make a long gash down the back of the neck, cutting the skin to the bone. Fold the skin back over the breast and carefully remove the crop, being very careful not to break the skin or the crop. When the crop is loosened so that you can take it in your hand, cut that part which is fastened to the intestines at the neck and remove it. Now turn the fowl over on its back; make an incision at the end of the breast-bone and with your two front fingers loosen all the intestines at the back, Then at the crop opening, loosen the heart and lungs,<pb n="190" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=232"/> or "lights." Put your two fingers and thumb in the opening under the breast bone, grasp the gizzard and intestines, and carefully remove them all together and without breaking. Drop them for a moment and with a sharp knife cut around the large intestine and your chicken is clean. Examine to see if the heart and lungs are removed; then cut the oil sack from the rump, wipe carefully on the inside with a wet cloth to remove blood clots. Do not, under any circumstances, put chickens or turkeys into a pan of cold water to soak. If there is an odor about the flesh, it is unfit for food, and washing will not remove it. The juices of the flesh are drawn out by the soaking; the meat is tasteless and you have lost a portion of the nourishment. There is no necessity for breaking the gall or intestines, but if such a thing should occur, quickly wipe off the flesh. The fowl is now ready for "trussing," or putting into shape.<emph rend="bold">TRUSSING.</emph></p><p>Cut the neck close to the breast-bone; fold the skin back; tuck the wings down over it and with a single stitch fasten them into shape. Press the legs down close to the side, run the trussing needle directly through the body, bringing it back over the leg joints; tie on one side. Carefully work the skin down over the ends of the leg bones and sew the two legs close to the side of the breast bone, fastening them to the rump. A fowl properly trussed has only three stitches, is perfectly compact and will not get out of shape in the cooking.</p><p>Ducks and geese, in fact all poultry or birds, are cleaned in precisely the same way. Ducks and geese, however, have gullets not crops; they may be loosened at the neck and taken out at the lower vent.</p><p>If stuffing is to be used, put it in the carcass, and sew up the vents, then truss as directed.</p><p>The "giblets" consist of the liver, heart and gizzard. The feet, scalded and skinned, and the neck are added to the giblets. To open the gizzard peel off the blue skin. Then remove the fleshy part, first on one side, then on the other. Do not cut the gizzard into halves and turn it wrong side out, In this way the<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=233"/>

Follow the general directions for roasting, page 43. Have the oven hot until skin is browned, then cool, and if stuffed, cook twenty minutes to a pound; unstuffed fifteen, allowing fifteen minutes extra at first for the heating. Baste with the fat in the pan every ten minutes; do not add water. Serve with unstuffed chicken or turkey one starchy vegetable, as plain boiled rice or rice croquettes, or sweet or white potato croquettes, a green vegetable, as creamed onions or peas, or asparagus, or Jerusalem artichokes or stachys and cranberry or barberry sauce, or spiced currants, or sour grape or crab-apple jelly.</p>

</recipe><hd rend="bold" align="right">TURKEY</hd><p>For roasting select as first choice a young hen turkey. The legs should be black, the skin and flesh white, the breast broad and plump. The shorter the neck the better. An old turkey is rather broad not plump, legs reddish, and the end of the breast bone exceedingly hard. A young gobbler, very nice for roasting, will have black legs and small spurs. A gobbler is much larger than a hen even at the same age, and is consequently less economical, as the carcass weighs heavy. Under no conditions purchase old poultry, either turkey,chicken,goose or duck. The flesh is strong and stringy, has always a surplus of fatwhich it loses in cooking, and even when carefully boiled or steamed is not palatable or economical. As soon as a turkey comes from the market, singe carefully over a burning gas jet or a tablespoonful of burning alcohol. Then wash the skin<pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=246"/> thoroughly, rinse and wipe it dry. With the cleaver cut off the head, leaving a long neck. Cut the skin at the side of the leg joint and very lightly over the top. Bend the foot back, loosening the ligaments or sinews the same as in a chicken, clean, truss and bake or roast the same as chicken. Turkeys are much better baked or roasted without stuffing. A turkey stuffed with chestnuts is, however, considered a delicacy.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">CAPONS</hd><p>Singe, draw and truss the same as chickens. Roast or bake. If stuffing is preferred, use oysters or chestnuts.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">DUCKS</hd><p>Tame ducks to be well flavored must be penned at least ten days before killing. Like chickens they are scavengers and the flesh is flavored by the material they eat. We have in the market "celery fed" ducks, ducks fed for a week or more on finely chopped celery; this imparts an extremely delicious flavor to the flesh.</p><hd align="center">TO SELECT.</hd><p>A young duck can be readily told by the soft under-bill; in bending, it easily breaks; the lower part of the legs should be smooth, and the webbing of the feet soft. They should be sufficiently fattened to have plump breasts; overfattened ducks are, however, not desirable. Singe the same as chickens. Cut off the feet, then the head; make a vent at the end of breastbone, lengthwise; loosen the gullet at the neck, being careful not to break the skin on the breast. From the lower vent loosen the intestines, and grasping the gizzard, pull them all out; bring out with them the gullet. In trussing two stitches only are required, one to hold the wings back and one to fasten the legs down close to the side. The breast bone of a duck or other swimming bird, is broad and flat, not pointed as in a chicken.<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=247"/>

As the "pelt" of Belgian hare is valuable (the fur is sold under the name of electric or near-seal), it is removed before the animal is exposed for sale; for this reason the Belgian hare has been overlooked by the average housewife. She is accustomed to buying rabbits with the skin on and is not used to the sight of a rabbit with the skin off; she always orders the rabbit "skinned," but not being a frequent visitor to her kitchen, has never perhaps seen it "naked." For this reason she objects to the market appearance of Belgian hare. In the western part of the United States, in nearly all the hotels, restaurants and private houses, Belgian hare is looked upon as a great delicacy. It is canned and sold under the name of "boned turkey." The meat is white and compact, of fine flavor and tender. They are the cleanest of all animals, and being reared for the fur, are well fed and cared for. It is said by physicians that broth made from Belgian hare is preferable to that made from beef, mutton, or chicken; that it is not so stimulating and slightly nutritious. They may be cooked in every way in which one can cook chicken?croquettes,<pb n="209" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=257"/> panned, barbecued, ragout, fried, roasted, stuffed and baked, salad and cutlets.

<chapter class1="accompaniments"><hd rend="bold" align="center">MEAT SAUCES</hd><p>When one becomes perfectly familiar with the philosophy of a sauce, all sauces are quickly and easily made, and without continual reference to written recipes. A rounding tablespoonful of flour, weighs a half ounce. A rounding tablespoonful of butter or fat, one ounce. These two measurements are used to each half pint of liquid; if the fat is measured melted, two tablespoonfnls will be counted as one. If you are making tomato sauce, for instance, use one tablespoonful of butter and one of flour rubbed together, then add a half pint of strained tomato. For a white or cream sauce, the same measurement of butter and flour, one tablespoonful of each rubbed together and a half pint of milk, and so changing the liquid one may make many sauces. In making roasted beef gravy, pour the fat from the pan, reserving the given quantity. Here the fat will be liquid or melted, as it is hot; use two tablespoonfuls with one rounding tablespoonful of flour, and a half pint of water or stock. Always rub the fat and flour together, add the liquids cold, unless otherwise directed, and stir until they reach the boiling point. In this way the flour is most thoroughly cooked and not rendered indigestible as when cooked in the fat. Butter and flour cooked together form a very objectionable compound.</p><p>When fat comes to the surface of a sauce., too much fat has been used. Under all circumstances the fat must be rubbed with the flour, the liquid then added, otherwise you will have a greasy, separated sauce. If the sauce boils after it has once reached the boiling point it will also separate. It must be strained at once into the gravy bowl or kept over warm or hot water. A brown sauce may be colored with caramel, burnt onion or kitchen bouquet. A brown sauce must be brown, a white sauce, white, and a yellow sauce, yellow.</p> <pb n="215" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=263"/>

Chop off a portion of the lower rib, and "top" the roast. Place the meat, bone side down, in the roasting pan. It requires no fastenings of any sort. When done, dish the joint on a large platter; good carving cannot be done in cramped quarters. Garnish one end of the platter with a large bunch of parsley or crisp celery tops.</p><p>First cut off the upper part from A to B, then run the knife at C close to the ribs, loosen the meat from the bone and around the butt end to B. Next cut off the outside slices, D to E, and place it on one side of the dish. Then cut thin slices, drawing the knife toward you. </p>

While mutton and potatoes are not, perhaps, an unwise combination, they certainly are not an attractive one. In the eternal fitness of things, we fall into conventional ways which frequently are more or less correct. From observations of what other people do, always copying those in advance of ourselves, we oft-times live better than we know.</p><p>A well cooked and well served dinner implies not only a thorough knowledge of cookery, but also of housewifery and the duties of a hostess. The real artist puts both heart and mind into every dish. It blends with the seasons, it is suited to the occasion, and harmonizes with the general manner of living. Simple foods well served are always attractive and elegant. A dish of roasted beef, simple and plain, becomes elegant when well cooked, neatly arranged and garnished on a pretty platter, and served with the appropriate vegetables. Wise combinations please first the eye, then the palate, then the stomach. Indulgence, however, often leads to overfeeding, and this to a lack of thought regarding the quality as well as the quantity of food ingested.</p><p>For many years, greens such as parsley, chervil, cress, lettuce and celery, have been the accepted decorations for meat and game platters, but the ugly and conventional ring of greens around every meat dish has been entirely abolished for the more dainty colorings. A dish of braised birds is no longer found in a wreath of cress, but is daintily garnished with tiny almond croquettes, piled cannon-ball fashion at the sides or ends, with here and there a dainty bread patty holding a teaspoonful of jelly, and with handsome sprigs of<pb n="240" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=298"/> parsley at the head of each bird. Different shades of brown with the green are exceedingly beautiful. Avoid combina-tions of bright colors, save with few exceptions. Potato salad garnished with chopped red beets, or lobster cutlets garnished with the brilliant claws of the lobster, are natural and attractive.</p>

<chapter class1="eggscheesedairy"><pb n="247" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=305"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">EGGS</hd><p>The egg of the domestic fowl, the one in common use, and the only one to be considered here, is a typical or perfect food; that is, it contains all the elements of the blood and is capable of supporting perfectly the young chick in its development. It is not, however, a typical or perfect food for the human adult, and when eaten by such is placed among the nitrogenous foods, and served with such fatty materials as breakfast bacon, with oil in salad dressings, or with white bread and butter.</p><p>In arranging bills of fare, perfect dietaries, it is well to com-pare the analyses of egg, meat and milk. Study carefully the quantity of nitrogen, carbon, and also the amount of mineral matter in each.</p><p>Bauer calls especial attention to the mineral matter of eggs, milk and flesh. The latter is rich in potassium, phosphoric and sulphuric acids, but contains little sodium, calcium or chlorine, while milk is rich in calcium and chlorine, and eggs in iron, sodium, and phosphoric acid. Keep before you these analyses, and count up for yourself the proportion of each ingredient before arranging the bills of fare. To make a perfect diet, mix with these, carbonaceous foods and such vegetables as go to make up the loss of certain elements and mineral matter in them. Ten eggs of medium size weigh a pound. Eggs, being nitro-genous, are muscle building foods, and are principally digested in the stomach. They are easily digested raw; not difficult of digestion when simply cooked. Hard boiled eggs, however, are to be rejected by persons with weak digestion. According to Yeo the following analysis is correct:</p>

</table><pb n="248" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=306"/><p>It will be noticed that the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> and <ingredient>white</ingredient> differ in composi-tion. The <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> contains less <ingredient>water,</ingredient> a small amount of <ingredient>sulphur,</ingredient> fatty matter and proteid materials known as globulin, while the <ingredient>white of the egg</ingredient> is chiefly a solution of albumin. In feeding children it is frequently found that the <ingredient>yolk of hard boiled egg</ingredient> will agree better than the whole of soft boiled <ingredient>egg.</ingredient></p><p>The beaten <ingredient>white of egg</ingredient> is used frequently in place of bak-ing-powder or <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> as a leavening agent; it does not act chemically upon the materials with which it is mixed; the membrane being tough, has the power of holding the air beaten into it; it is then mixed with a batter, and at once cooked. In this way the air cells are fixed by the heat, which gives the light appearance, as in sponge cake or souffl&#233;es.</p><p>Do not jar the stove while these light dishes are cooking, or the cells will break.</p><p>To ascertain the freshness of an <ingredient>egg</ingredient> without breaking it, fold your hand around and hold the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> between the sun or bright light and yourself; look through it. If the <ingredient>yolk</ingredient> appears round and the <ingredient>white</ingredient> clear it is fresh; or you may drop it into a bucket of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> if perfectly fresh it will sink and fall on its side. If it topples around in the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> standing on its end, it is fairly fresh. If it floats beware of it. The shell of a fresh <ingredient>egg</ingredient> looks dull and porous, that of an old <ingredient>egg</ingredient> thin and shiny. When <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are kept any length of time there is a loss of <ingredient>water</ingredient> by evaporation through the pores of the cells. This will cause the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> to rattle in the shell. An <ingredient>egg</ingredient> that rattles may be perfectly good. It must be tested in some other way before being condemned.</p><hd align="center">TO PRESERVE EGGS</hd><p>To <ingredient>preserve eggs</ingredient> it is only necessary to close the pores of the shell. This may be done by clipping them in melted <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> or packing them in <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> the small ends downward, using a goodly quantity of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> between each layer of <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> Or they may be packed in <ingredient>brine;</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> however, is to be preferred. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> may also be kept in <ingredient>lime water,</ingredient> packing them carefully, small ends down, using sufficient <ingredient>water</ingredient> to thoroughly cover. This not only protects them from the air, but acts as a germicide. Egs<pb n="249" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=307"/> should be packed not later than the middle of May nor earlier than the first of April. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> may be placed in cold storage and kept at an even temperature of 400 Fahr.; when taken from this temperature they must be used at once. They will not keep in a warm temperature in good condition twenty-four hours.</p><p><ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> may also be evaporated, and kept in glass bottles or jars. Separate the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks,</ingredient> spread a few at a time on a clean stoneware or china platter and slowly evaporate or dry in a very cool oven. When the mixture is fine and perfectly dry it is ready to put away. This powder is capable of taking up the same amount of <ingredient>water</ingredient> that has been evaporated from it, and may then be used the same as fresh <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient></p>

</table><p>We must call attention in a very emphatic way to this word "food." <ingredient>Milk,</ingredient> being a complete food, is not a beverage, and should not be used as such. Many persons complain that they cannot take <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and forget this fact, taking it with other nitro-genous foods, overpowering their digestion. <ingredient>Milk,</ingredient> however, is not intended as a typical food for the adult. It does not require mastication, and teeth are given us for this purpose.</p><p>It has been estimated by the chemists of the Agricultural Department at Washington that one quart of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is equal in nourishment to three-quarters of a pound of <ingredient>beef.</ingredient> We find, however, by experience, that a man can do more work with greater ease on the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> than the <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> he does not become hungry so soon. The protein or nitrogenous compounds of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> are casein and albumin, and for convenience will be referred to hereafter as casein. The carbo-hydrate is lactose or <ingredient>milk sugar,</ingredient> represented by the same symbols as <ingredient>cane sugar,</ingredient> C12H22O11. It is, however, not so sweet, and less liable to fermentation. The fats are called <ingredient>butter</ingredient> fats, and correspond to those found in several vegetable substances. <ingredient>Olive oil,</ingredient> cocoa-<ingredient>nut butter,</ingredient> and the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> of the palm tree contain fats of similar nature.</p><pb n="260" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=320"/><p><ingredient>Milk</ingredient> is not easy of digestion unless sipped slowly or masti-cated, as it were. When poured down the throat like a glass of <ingredient>water</ingredient> it enters the stomach in a mass, is coagulated by the ferment, rennin. It is then separated into curds and <ingredient>whey</ingredient> by the muscular action or churning of the stomach. It is finally rolled into a hardball, which is difficult of digestion from its very density. For this reason it is better to give children a piece of <ingredient>hard bread</ingredient> or other food requiring mastication at the same time they are eating the <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> The curd of <ingredient>cows</ingredient>' <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is much more dense, less friable, than that of human <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> This will explain why <ingredient>cows</ingredient>' <ingredient>milk</ingredient> upsets the digestion of infants and even of older children. An adult who pours down his throat a glass of <ingredient>cold milk</ingredient> during or at the close of the meal has not yet learned to respect the power of his digestive apparatus. There are two important rules to be remembered in taking <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> one to take it slowly and masticate it, the other to take it cool, not iced, nor should it be boiled.</p><p>It is a well established fact that <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is an admirable con-veyor of diseased germs.

Avoid foods covered with melted <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or cooked in <ingredient>butter.</ingredient></p><hd align="center">FERMENTATION OF MILK</hd><p>The normal fermentations to which <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is subject are of three sorts: First, lactic fermentation, in which the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> becomes sour; second, changes in the albuminoids of the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> putre-factive changes, and those in which the fats are attacked by butyric fermentation.</p><p>Ropy <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> a condition frequently met with, is due to a fun-gus making its appearance during the warm, moist weather of<pb n="262" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=322"/> August. It is not known to be injurious, but is exceedingly unpleasant. The "red'1 and "blue" milks are caused by bacteria. While there are probably no germs found in c<ingredient>lean milk,</ingredient> that may be classed as harmful, there are germs not classed among the disease producing ones that get into the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> through care-lessness in milking or from unclean vessels or utensils in which the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is kept, that produce poisonous compounds known as ptomaines. These frequently occur in stale custard pies, cheeses, ice <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> cream puffs and other mixtures of boiled <ingredient>milk</ingredient> and <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> In <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> this is called tyro-toxicon, which simply means <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> poison. These ptomaines occur in all forms of cooked animal matter; <ingredient>oysters,</ingredient> <ingredient>fish</ingredient> and <ingredient>lobsters</ingredient> are particularly susceptible.</p><hd align="center">SOURING OF MILK</hd><p>It is supposed that thunder storms have an effect upon the sour-ing of <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> Experiments have proven, however, that such is not the case; electricity has nothing whatever to do with the rapid development of bacteria in the <ingredient>milk.</ingredient> But the conditions of the atmosphere preceding such a storm cause unusually rapid growth of bacteria. Sterilized <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is not affected by either the preceding conditions or the storm itself. To avoid such acci-dents, during the warm weather, cool the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> immediately after it is drawn from the <ingredient>cow,</ingredient> and keep it cold. <ingredient>Milk</ingredient> should be submerged in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> stirred until thoroughly cold, and kept cold. This <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is not in the slightest affected by thunder storms. Try the experiment. From the same dairy, cool one-half the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> as soon as it is drawn from the <ingredient>cow,</ingredient> and put in cool <ingredient>water</ingredient> or in the ice-house. Allow the other half to cool gradually, and then put it into a cold place. The <ingredient>milk</ingredient> allowed to cool gradually will sour quickly, especially during the "dog day" weather, even when there is no thunder storm, but just preceding the storm it will thicken at once. It is not the thunder, then, that has brought about the rapid growth of bac-teria, but the extreme heat preceding it. In the winter, souring may be hastened by adding a tablespoonful of thick, <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> to the fresh <ingredient>milk</ingredient> as soon as it is strained into the pans for standing.</p><pb n="263" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=323"/><hd align="center">DIGESTIBILITY OF MILK</hd><p><ingredient>Milk</ingredient> is said to be a stomach-digested food. When swallowed rapidly and taken in large quantities, it overpowers the diges-tion and renders the person very uncomfortable. It is not what we eat, but that which we can digest, that is true food.

The cooking or heating of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> makes it somewhat more difficult of digestion. There are exceptions, however, to the rule. The advantage is, that when <ingredient>milk</ingredient> is heated, people will sip it from a spoon; thus it becomes mixed with the saliva, and enters the stomach in a more digestible condition. Many per-sons can take fresh, warm <ingredient>milk</ingredient> with comfort, but could not pos-sibly take it if it was boiled.

It frequently occurs that the adult germs are more easily killed than the spores. Those that mature during the night are sure to be killed the next day, and thus the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> becomes dead or sterile.

In many of the creameries sweet <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is used in preference to sour. The <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is separated from the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> by means of a "separator" and churned at once into <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Such <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is sweet and delicious, but must be used at once or it will assume a sour or stale taste other than that which would have been imparted to the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> had it been allowed to stand before churning, The noted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> makers churn every day, and take<pb n="269" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=329"/> back and use over the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> that has been standing in the open market more than two days. <ingredient>Butter</ingredient> is exceedingly susceptible to flavors, and must be kept in a place free from contamination. In winter at the ordinary farmhouse, where <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is cold, scald the churn; let it stand for a moment, turn out the <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> and turn in the <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> The heat of the churn will be sufficient to bring the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to a temperature of 65? Fahr., a good tem-perature for churning. After the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> has been churned, turn the dasher backwards and forwards for a few moments to "col-lect" it. Take it out; stand it for a moment in a very cold place. Do not wash the <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> as in this way it is robbed of elements necessary for its flavor and preservation. Begin now to work it, and work continuously and thoroughly until every particle of <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> is drained out. This is best done on a slanting board. You may use a corrugated roller or an ordinary paddle. It is the fashion to add <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> although it is much better unsalted. Allow one tablespoonful to each pound of <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> After this, work it for five minutes; make at once into prints, and stand away in a cold place.</p><p>To wash soft <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> after it has been thoroughly collected in the churn, draw off the <ingredient>buttermilk</ingredient> and add <ingredient>water</ingredient> at the temperature of 500 Fahr. about one-half the amount of <ingredient>butter-milk</ingredient> withdrawn.

It is true, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> quickly hardens under such a change, but is greatly affected by after temperatures. It is better to increase the coolness of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the washings, using the milder tem-perature at first.

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="277" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=337"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">VEGETABLES</hd><p>The American people, as a class, in their rushing and bustling life, prefer to take their nitrogen from animal products, which are rather more easily digested and assimilated than vegetables. It is a fact, however, that all the elements necessary for the building of the body are found in the vegetable world. Our working animals, " beasts of burden," build and repair large bodies, under heavy labor, on materials from the vegetable kingdom. True, their digestive apparatus is rather different from man's, and is better suited to the dry, concentrated cereals. We do not, however, get from the animal a single element except that which the animal has taken from the vegetable world. His flesh is the result of the digestion of vegetable materials. Flesh is living tissue, the partly digested food, hence, more easily digested by man than vegetables at first hand. Meat is rich in water, containing less nitrogen than peas, beans and lentils, but in a more acceptable form to American and English business men or teachers who spend most of their lives in close, ill-ventilated rooms. There are many sides to the vegetarian question worthy of consideration. Our so-called food specialists are usually meat-eating men. Experiments with vegetable food are limited to a narrow range. I have not yet seen a single list containing nuts, cereals, fruits, nitrogenous, succulent and starchy vegetables as a general diet. The true vegetarian uses all forms of vegetable foods; he does not try to live upon potatoes and so-called green or succulent vegetables. These do not contain nitrogen, and are insufficient to sustain life. Nuts well prepared and mixed with cereals, and' such easily digested foods as rice give sustaining power not attainable by meat. Health and nutrition depend entirely upon the class of vegetables selected. The Japanese, who do in their country the work performed by horses here, are practically vegetarians.</p><p>It is stated quite dogmatically that vegetables are less<pb n="278" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=338"/> completely digested than meats. Such decisions are made after incomplete and short experiments, and cannot be substantiated.</p><p>Meat carefully cooked is more easily digested than some vegetables; but vegetables are clean and wholesome. Nitrogenous vegetables are slow of digestion; hence, the vegetarian requires but two meals per day; but in those two meals, especially if his diet is well selected, he will receive more nourish-ment than from three meals of meat. Two points have been gained, time spent in eating and money saved. Then, too, he has had much greater variety. The vegetarian is not compelled to eat steaks, chops and roasted beef to be followed by roasts of beef, steaks and chops; but selects from a score of dishes made by blending different vegetables, nuts and fruits. Vegetable foods are not to any great extent digested in the stomach, with the exception of the leguminous seeds, which are rich in proteids. Vegetable foods call forth greater mechanical effort on the part of the stomach than meats. If a person has indigestion, meats are to be preferred. The amount of cellulose or waste in vegetable foods keeps up the peristaltic motion of the intestines and lower bowels; hence, vegetable eaters are very rarely troubled with constipation and torpid livers. Skin diseases are frequently due to a lack of green vegetables.</p><p>An observer can readily understand, however, why we have grown into a meat-eating nation. A short visit into the house of a neighbor makes this point quite plain. The so-called cook, an uneducated woman who is perhaps a second-rate scullery maid, presides over the kitchen. She does not know the chemical composition of a single article she cooks, nor the effect of heat upon them. She does know how to cook meats; they can be broiled or roasted. These two methods form the limit of her horizon. Broiling intensifies the flavor of a steak, and with a little seasoning of salt and pepper, and a bunch of parsley, makes a palatable and sightly dish. The cook has given it little care and less thought. Not so with vegetables; they owe their flavor to volatile oils which are easily dissipated by careless or rapid cooking, Badly cooked<pb n="279" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=339"/> vegetables are tasteless; all the flavor has been cooked out and poured down the drain. Potatoes, a common vegetable, served -in nearly every household once or twice a day, are seldom well cooked, palatable or sightly. Rice is almost unfit for food; in nine cases out of ten it is yellow, not white, heavy and sodden, a mass of wet starch. Few things show the difference between comfortable and slovenly housekeeping more quickly than the dressing of vegetables.</p><p>Vegetables are divided into four classes: Those rich in nitrogen, muscle and tissue building foods; those containing carbo-hydrates, starch and sugar; fatty vegetables, nuts and olives; and the vegetables containing water and mineral matter. In the first class we have peas, beans and lentils, and the chick pea of the East. Nitrogen is also found in goodly quantities in the cereals and nuts and glutin macaroni. In the second class, carbo-hydrates, we have rice, white bread, potatoes, the ordinary macaroni. Those containing mineral matter and water are the so-called succulent vegetables, as cabbage, carrots, turnips, spinach, cress, lettuce and tomatoes. The nitrogenous principles of vegetables are acted upon in the stomach the same as those of meat; the carbo-hydrates in the mouth and the small intestines; fats are emulsionized by the secretions from the pancreas and gall. There is no difference between meats and vegetables in the place or method of digestion. The effects upon the body, the time consumed, and the mechanical efforts of the body are. no doubt, radically different.</p><p>Vegetables, as a rule, should be cooked in uncovered vessels, covering does not keep in the flavor. Rapid boiling renders underground vegetables, as parsnips, carrots and turnips, tough. Cook them in water at 2100 Fahr.; this softens the fibre and quickly renders them tender, and at the same time, they retain their flavor and color. Rapid boiling dissipates the flavor and spoils the color. Rice and macaroni should be boiled rapidly, not that the water is hotter, but the motion of rapidly boiling water washes apart and separates the particles. Both contain starch; if allowed to simmer or cooked in a double boiler, they become soft, sticky, water-soaked and soggy. Potatoes must be cooked at the boiling point; this does not mean at a gallop.<pb n="280" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=340"/> All vegetables go over the fire in boiling water?this does not mean lukewarm or water that has been boiled, but water that is boiling. To green vegetables add a teaspoonful of salt to each half gallon of water in which they are to be boiled. Underground vegetables, as the roots and tubers of plants, are best cooked in unsalted water. These are rich in woody fibre; the fibre is toughened by the hardened water. For instance, turnips are white, sweet and palatable, dainty and delicious vegetables, if cut into blocks and cooked carefully in unsalted water. Boil the same kind of turnips rapidly in salt water and notice the difference?the first are white and sweet, the second, pink, coarse and unpalatable. It is a well known fact that all vegetables containing casein, as split peas, lentils, old peas and beans, are not softened in hard water. The salts of lime coagulate the casein and render it dense and difficult of digestion. Add a saltspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda to each half gallon of water in which they are boiled. This will soften the water and make vegetables tender. Do not add soda, however, to green vegetables. Onions, if carefully cooked in salted water, are delicious; they lose their sweetness and aroma when boiled in unsalted water.</p><p>If green vegetables become wilted from keeping or dryness. put them in clear, cold water; do not under any circumstances add salt to the water; it draws out the juices and hardens the fibre. For example, cucumbers soaked five minutes in salted water are tough, will never regain their crispness, and are poisonous to a delicate stomach. Simple methods of cooking all vegetables are to be preferred. Carefully boiled or baked, and served with delicate sauces they are most attractive.</p><p>It is said that all vegetables not containing starch are best and more wholesome served raw. The roots, as turnips, carrots and beets, must, however, be grated or scraped. The dense fibre renders them difficult of mastication and digestion.</p><p>To freshen wilted vegetables, soak them before cooking in clear, cold, unsalted water.</p><p>For the convenience of persons who are on a restricted diet, the vegetables have been arranged in groups, that their chemical composition may be seen at a glance.</p><pb n="281" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=341"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION OF OUR COMMON VEGETABLES</hd><emph rend="bold">Dicotyledons.</emph><p>Cruciferae, Mustard Family.<lb/>Water-cress; Horseradish; Cabbage tribe; Turnip; Rutabaga; Mustard, black and white; Peppergrass; Radish.</p><p>Cappaiudaceae, Caper Family. <lb/>Capers.</p><p>Malvaceae, Mallow Family. <lb/>Okra.</p><p>Geraniaceae, Geranium Family. <lb/>Wood Sorrel, Nasturtium,</p><p>Leguminosae, Pulse Family.<lb/>Soy Bean; Peanut; Kidney Bean; String Bean; Lima Bean; Black Bean; Pea; Chick Pea; Lentil; St. John's Bread.</p><p>Cucurbitaceae, Gourd Family.<lb/>Pumpkin; Squash, summer and winter; Cucumber; Vegetable Marrow.</p><p>Umrelliferae, Parsley Family.<lb/>This family contains many of the aromatic seeds.

A few recipes for the cooking and preserving of the more common varieties will, I am sure, be of great service.</p><p>The question, how can one be sure of "<ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient>" or "toadstools" is an important one.

The question reverts then, to how can one be sure of knowing the poisonous from the edible varieties.</p><p>Let me emphatically state that there is no royal road to distinguishing the poisonous from the edible <ingredient>mushrooms;</ingredient> one must know all their characteristics, habitat and general appearance. All of the common tests, as the gold ring or silver spoon, are fallacies.</p><p>In certain parts of the country the common people use the Morel, calling it a <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> and every other variety a toadstool. In many States the Agaricus campestris is known as the <ingredient>mushroom,</ingredient> and all others are toadstools. In Maine, especially on some of the coast islands, the Cantharellus is the <ingredient>mushroom.</ingredient> So that the term <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> or toadstool is not applied to the same fungus in different places.</p><p>Avoid all <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> that have a veil hanging in a form of skirt from the stem and those having a cup or volva in the ground out of which the stem seems to be growing.

Avoid such <ingredient>mushrooms;</ingredient> do not even taste them, for the poisonous ones are very deadly.</p><p><ingredient>Mushrooms</ingredient> differ in analysis and density of flesh as well as in flavor, hence, different methods of cooking are desirable. The Coprinus micaceus and Lepiota procera are easily destroyed by long and severe cooking. The more dense and common Agaricus campestris, and some varieties of the Boleti, require long slow cooking to make them tender, digestible, and bring out the flavor. Simplicity in <ingredient>seasoning</ingredient> is desirable; <ingredient>wine,</ingredient> <ingredient>mustard,</ingredient> <ingredient>onion</ingredient> or any other decided flavors will entirely overpower the delicate <ingredient>mushroom</ingredient> flavor.</p><p>All <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> are best cooked without peeling, with the exception of the puff ball, which should always be pared.

Green vegetables are bulk foods, which aid in keep-ing up the natural peristaltic movement of the intestines. For this reason also they should be served at least once a day, each of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year.</p><p>Many of these green vegetables contain materials physiologically suited to our needs; better by far take iron as we find it in many of the ordinary green vegetables, than from a bottle. Persons who cut from their diet all succulent vegetables are continuously taking pills to bring about the necessary natural conditions which would exist by the judicial and regular use of green vegetables. </p> 
<p>The object of cooking non-starchy vegetables is to soften the fibre and to render them more easy of digestion.

The common <ingredient>turnip,</ingredient> an admirable succulent vegetable, sightly, palatable and appetising if daintily cooked is, nine times out of ten, ruined in the cooking. Raw <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> is digested in two hours and a half; after it passes through the hands of the ordi-nary cook it requires five hours, which certainly upsets the true definition of cooking. Besides making the <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> difficult of digestion, careless cooking fills the house with an odor which is not only unpleasant but nauseating. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> is drained down the sink and a coarse unsightly dish without food value is the result. Vegetables with an odor, as <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> and <ingredient>onions,</ingredient> should always be put over to cook in boiling <ingredient>salted water</ingredient> and cooked in an uncovered vessel.</p><p>Green vegetables lend themselves most easily to combinations of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> for the making of the so-called <ingredient>cream</ingredient> soups. The <ingredient>milk</ingredient> containing the needed nourishment is made palatable by the flavor of a few left-over vegetables. These soups are nitrogen-ous, easy of digestion and with whole <ingredient>wheat bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> form an admirable luncheon or supper dish for children. Save even a tablespoonful of vegetables that may be left from a meal; to-morrow add them to the soup; or mash and use them as flavoring to the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> or <ingredient>fish</ingredient> sauces.

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="439" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=505"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">SALADS</hd><p>The term salad is applied to certain cold dishes composed either of meats, fish or vegetables. For generations these have been served with a mixture of oil and vinegar, or oil, egg and vinegar. The oil furnishes the fatty matter for the meal, and being purely vegetable is more wholesome than the ordinary animal fats. Butter and cream are wholesome if taken unheated, but to make salad dressing, the butter is usually melted; hence its digestibility is destroyed, and under such circumstances a salad is robbed of its mission.</p><p>In these latter days many American cooks make a mixture of fruit, sugar and alcohol, and serve them as "salads." These are not salads; are heavy, rather unwholesome, and will never take the place of a salad. I much prefer to call them fruit cocktails, and serve them as first course at luncheon or a twelve o'clock breakfast; or a dessert, and serve them with the ices at the close of the meal. Fruits mixed with mayonnaise dressing, and served as a salad are unsightly, unpalatable and a little nauseating. One cannot think of anything more out of keeping than white grapes in a thick mayonnaise. The simple so-called French dressing is delicate and most worthy of recommendation. Over lettuce, cress or celery it certainly makes a palatable and wholesome dinner salad, and one in which children can be freely indulged. Such fruits as apples, pears, cherries, and pineapples, mixed with celery or lettuce, with French dressing, make an agreeable dinner salad.</p><p>A salad, simple in its construction, should be seen on every well regulated table three hundred and sixty-five times a year. Persons living in the country or on the outskirts of towns can without cost, always pick sorrel, long dock, dandelions, and lambs' quarters. In the city, one can, for a few pennies, buy sufficient greens for a dainty salad. If you cannot afford salad and dessert, choose the former by all means. The happiest<pb n="440" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=506"/> closing to a real good dinner is a crisp salad well dressed, served with a bit of cheese and bread and butter or toasted cracker.</p><p>Left-over green vegetables, as beans, peas, carrots, turnips, may be used separately or mixed, dressed with French dressing, and served as a dinner salad. When you are cooking vegetables to-day for dinner, cook double the quantity, saving a portion to serve cold for to-morrow's salad. Asparagus is much better cold than hot. Cold boiled cauliflower, carefully cooked spinach, leeks, beets, may all take their place in this delightful dish.</p><p>The Romans and Greeks used salads at the beginning of their dinner to create an appetite. In later days, however, salads are served at the end of the heavy portion of the dinner, or with the game, to bring back or sharpen the flagging appetite to the greater enjoyment of the final sweet.</p><p>The green vegetables contain the salts necessary to the well being of our blood, and oil is an important and essential food. The garlic and vinegar aid in the digestion and assimilation of other foods. In the use of garlic we must be most temperate. Rub the bottom of the bowl, or the bowl of the salad spoon. Bits of garlic throughout the salad are most unpleasant. Better use decided flavorings, in the form of flavored or scented vinegars. Put a few cloves of garlic into your vinegar cruet; into another, a little celery seed, or chervil; a mixture of these vinegars, or alternate use, will give variety and agreeable flavor. Tarragon vinegar is commonly used with mayonnaise dressing, sauce tartare, sauce Bearnaise and rich dressings of this character. Any small, fine greens that are in season, such as chives, mint, or chervil, may be finely minced and sprinkled over the dinner lettuce.</p><p>Standing at the very head of salad vegetables is the cos, or Romaine lettuce, and the ordinary delicate head lettuce, and corn salad, endive, chicory, sorrel, celery, garden and water cress, tomatoes and cucumbers. In the early spring the young tender dandelion leaves mixed with lettuce and a little carefully cooked beet root make a delightful dinner salad. Radishes, tomatoes and turnips are frequently used chopped fine, sprinkled over lettuce. Cauliflower, string beans, delicate shelled beans<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=507"/>

Nothing can be more delicate and delightful than the crisp, carefully cut, hardportion of a well bleached <ingredient>head of cabbage.</ingredient></p><p>A spherical wire basket, known as a salad shaker, or drainer, is used to dry the salad materials after they have been thoroughly washed. The leaves of very curly <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> frequently hold the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> even after shaking. Dry them with a soft piece of cheesecloth. If not dry, the dressing will not be evenly distributed.</p><p>Salads are digested largely in the small intestine. The <ingredient>oil</ingredient> contributes to the heat of the body; the small amount of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> aids in the digestion of other materials.</p>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><emph rend="bold">FRENCH DRESSING</emph></purpose> To make French dressing, rub the bottom of the bowl with a <ingredient>clove of garlic</ingredient> or <ingredient>onion.</ingredient> Put in a half teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> a saltspoonful of <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and add gradually, rubbing all the while, six tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>olive oil.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> is dissolved, add a tablespoonful of plain or <ingredient>tarragon vinegar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon juice.</ingredient> Beat well for a moment and pour over the salad. Use at once. <ingredient>Worcestershire sauce,</ingredient> <ingredient>onion juice,</ingredient> or <ingredient>tomato catsup,</ingredient> may all be added in turn. Do not use all these seasonings at one time; by constant change a number of dressings may be made from a single recipe. <ingredient>Lemon juice</ingredient> may be substituted for <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> in proportions of one tablespoonful to six tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>oil.</ingredient> Whenever the <ingredient>oil</ingredient> ''floats," too much <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> has been added.</p><p>If you are a diner you will of course object to mixing a French dressing in a bowl, and pouring it over the salad. The ideal method is to mix the dressing and salad by degrees. To do this easily, sprinkle over the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and pour over the desired quantity of <ingredient>oil;</ingredient> turn or toss with the fork and spoon until each leaf is seasoned; measure out the desired quantity of <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and pour it over the salad, and again toss and turn until the whole is evenly distributed.

Under<pb n="442" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=510"/> no circumstances must <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> be cut with a knife. The old Spanish proverb most aptly describes the necessary characteristics of a salad maker: "A spendthrift for <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> a miser for <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> and a madman to stir it up." That means that the stirring must be quickly and deftly done. People with cultivated palates rarely eat things that are called sour.

<chapter><pb n="474" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=546"/><hd align="center"><emph rend="bold">CEREAL FOODS</emph></hd><p>In this group will be found all foods made from the ordinary grains, the seeds of grasses, as wheat, oats, barley, rye and corn. As these seeds are the stored nourishment for the young plants, they are rich in nutritive materials, proteids, carbo-hydrates, fats and mineral matter. The principal carbo-hydrate is starch, which is from 65 to 70 per cent. of the entire grain. There is a very small quantity of sugar, and in the dry grains not more than 10 to 12 per cent. of water. The mineral matter is principally lime and phosphoric acid, and is about 2 per cent. of the grain. Cellulose is found principally in the outer husk, which, in the process of manufacture, is removed, hence, the grains, if well cooked, are rather easy of digestion. Being largely starch, the primary digestion is in the mouth, but they are principally digested in the small intestine. All cereals, when well prepared and daintily served, are certainly attractive and wholesome. When eaten with fruit, or cream, milk, or eggs, they should form the greater part of food for men. The cheapness of production, and the wide area over which they can be produced, commend them to the masses. Compare for a moment the quantity of food that can be obtained from the grains, fruits and nuts, with the amount available from any other source, and you will find the advantage overwhelming in their favor.</p><p>Weight for weight, not bulk for bulk, cereals must be counted as very nutritious foods. They are not difficult of digestion, provided they are well masticated. When swallowed quickly, as is frequently the habit with mushes, they offer greater resistance to the stomach than toast or breads. For this reason, toast and cream, or better, blocks of stale bread, with cream, are recommended as a good wholesome breakfast cereal for children.</p><pb n="475" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=547"/><hd align="center"><emph rend="bold">COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF GRAINS</emph></hd><p>These tables are principally from

<emph rend="italic">(Avena sativa)</emph></hd><p>The <ingredient>oat</ingredient> plant is hardier than <ingredient>wheat,</ingredient> and ripens in much colder climates. It is interesting to observe that <ingredient>oats</ingredient> growing in the north or cold climates are rich in <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> while <ingredient>rice</ingredient> grown in warm climates is deficient in <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> To keep up the bodily heat, <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is required, making <ingredient>oats</ingredient> a typical winter or cold-climate food, while <ingredient>rice</ingredient> is adapted to warm weather.</p><p><ingredient>Oats</ingredient> are rich in nitrogenous matter and mineral substances, of which it loses less in the preparation than many of the other grains. Owing to the absence of glutin, <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> cannot be used for light-<ingredient>bread</ingredient> making unless it is mixed with <ingredient>wheat flour.</ingredient> It is made into thin cakes, called Irish <ingredient>oat</ingredient>cake or <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> wafers, which take the place of ordinary <ingredient>bread;</ingredient> but it is usually served in this country as a breakfast cereal, made into mush or porridge.</p><p>One pound of <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> will yield twice as much muscle-building material as an equal quantity of <ingredient>bread.</ingredient></p><p>The American people are beginning to realize that <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> well cooked and served without <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> is an admirable food for children as well as for adults. The age in which we live is a hurried one, and every saver of time is eagerly tried by the busy housewife. Thus it is that our cereal foods are frequently improperly cooked. The old fashioned "steel cut" <ingredient>oats</ingredient> required ten hours for cooking; the first part of the preparation was done the day before it was to be served, or enough was cooked on one day to serve for two. It was palatable, easily digested and assimilated, but required time and care for cooking. The American manufacturer, always ready to meet the demand of the housewife more than half way, conceived the idea that rolled <ingredient>oats</ingredient> would be more acceptable. Hence, the <ingredient>oats</ingredient> were steamed until slightly softened, then passed between rollers to make each grain perfectly flat or thin. In this way the heat penetrates more quickly to the centre of the grain; it requires less time for cooking and is still fairly palatable. Under no circumstances should rolled <ingredient>oats,</ingredient> <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> or <ingredient>barley</ingredient> be eaten unless it has been cooked at <pb n="477" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=549"/> least one hour, better two, A singular thing, and one which I have never been able to understand, is that the housewife will spend hours in the preparation of a pudding, pie or cake, the artificial and useless foods, and leave the <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> or breakfast cereal, so much more important, to the "cook," who, perhaps, stirs it hastily in <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and serves it up, after a few minutes' cooking, tasteless and pasty. This is the sort of <ingredient>oatmeal</ingredient> that must be covered with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream</ingredient> to make it palatable.</p><p>Nor is it wise to use continually partly digested and prepared cereals, "malted" or "roasted" preparations. <ingredient>Starch</ingredient> is a natural food, and when the envelope is made soluble by long, slow cooking, the natural digestive ferments will produce the necessary maltose and dextrin. The artificial methods outside the body are seldom to be recommended; the digestive organs lose their power if constantly interfered with, which makes it necessary to use "aids" to digestion.</p><p>In cooking cereals, use freshly <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> not <ingredient>water</ingredient> that has been standing in the kettle over night, nor <ingredient>water</ingredient> that that has been boiled and allowed to cool. A double boiler will prevent scorching. Add <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to the <ingredient>water</ingredient> before putting in the cereal.</p><p>Do not stir cereals while they are cooking or they will become soft, pasty and sticky.</p><p>Left-over cereals may be used as an addition to muffins, or served cold with <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> or as thickening to soups.</p><p>Stale, well baked <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> with <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> forms an excellent breakfast cereal, and one that requires mastication, which plays a very important part in digestion.</p>

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><pb n="487" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=559"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">BREAD</hd><p>The use of bread, in every family in this country, three times a day, makes this one of the most important departments. Wheat occupying the most prominent place in bread making, will have our first consideration. Many varieties are grown, but, for our special purposes here, they will be considered as the hard spring and the winter wheats. The first is sown in the spring and harvested in the late summer; the winter wheat is sown in the fall, sprouts, remains in the ground all winter, and is harvested about the same time as spring wheat. The winter wheats arc grown in warm climates; the spring wheats in northern cold climates.</p><p>With our present system of milling we are enabled to get from the hard spring wheat more gluten, muscle-building foods, than can be obtained from the soft winter wheats. As the price of flour is determined by the amount of gluten it contains, spring wheat flour is more expensive than the softer winter wheat flour. In the end, however, it is cheaper, as a given weight produces a greater quantity of bread. It holds more water and requires different handling, but makes bread making quite easy, compared to the old fashioned soft flours.</p><p>Most of the better grades of bread flours in common use are blended spring and winter, and, provided the blending is largely spring, the mixture is desirable. Two common names are used to distinguish the spring and winter flour. Strong flour, that rich in gluten, is frequently sold under the name of Minnesota Patent; the soft winter wheat flours, St. Louis Patent. In northern cities from Maine to Philadelphia, spring wheat, or a richly blended flour, is almost exclusively used for bread making. South, where hot breads are used daily, we find only the soft grades. While these are easily converted into hot bread, they cannot be made into good yeast "light" breads.</p><pb n="488" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=560"/><p>A good bread flour should be a rich, creamy yellow, rather coarse grained, so that it will fall apart, even after hard pressure in the hand." It cannot be packed. Soft winter flour should be a creamy yellow, soft under pressure, and easily packed in the hand. Genuine pastry flour is of a pale, yellowish white, fine, very starchy, and easily retains the form of the hand under pressure. This comes from the first and second boltings of either spring or winter wheat, usually winter. It is sold in cartons under various fancy names, and is especially desirable for such delicate batters as sunshine cake, angel food, souffles and puff paste. In small communities where the genuine pastry flour is not attainable, use in its place a good quality of winter wheat flour.</p><p>Avoid bluish white or grayish tinted flour; it is low-grade, and will make inferior bread.</p><p>White flour is poorer in calcium phosphate than wheat itself. The housewife, after studying the table of comparative analysis, can decide for herself which flour is best for her family. The struggle for existence in these days is so keen, that many people recommend wheat bread on account of its easy digestibility, especially in families where large quantities of meat are used.</p><p>"Whole wheat" flour is made from the whole wheat grain deprived of the outside bran and frequently the germ. It should be a rich dark brown in color, rather granulated or coarse. Good whole wheat flour contains all the albuminoids and the nutritive mineral matter of the wheat. In purchasing, select that free from large particles of bran. The outside husk is composed largely of cellulose, is indigestible and objectionable. If it becomes necessary to use bran now and then for medicinal purposes, to keep up the natural peristaltic conditions of the intestine, use Boston brown bread or a loaf of bran bread. Do not constantly mix bran with good whole wheat flour. Bread made from whole wheat flour is desirable for both adults and children, and is especially important to nursing mothers. It supplies the alkaline phosphates which contribute to the formation of the required salts in the body; and also contains the elements necessary for the building of bone and tooth structure. It may be possibly a little more difficult of <pb n="489" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=561"/> digestion than white bread, but one can certainly get more true food from the same quantity.</p><p>Much of the Graham flour sold in our markets is composed of white flour, mixed with a goodly quantity of outside bran and a small portion of ''shorts" or "middling." These bran particles are indestructible in the digestive tract, hence, are irritating, and, if taken with other foods, hurry them through the intestines, without giving time for proper digestion or absorption. Bran bread or Graham is to be recommended in cases of constipation, but should be spread with a little nut butter and masticated thoroughly, and taken without other food as a night meal. Constant irritation of the intestine is not only unwise, but dangerous. Better by far stimulate the intestines, and bring about a healthy action, than to depend entirely upon local irritation.</p><p>The "gluten" flour in the market is rich in albuminoids, but always contains a slight percentage of starch. By repeated experiments, I find that thoroughly washed dough, whereby all elements, except glutin are removed, is incapable of being made into light bread with the ordinary yeast plant. If a little sugar or starch is added, fermentation takes place at once.</p><p>Different flour, even from the same mill, ground at the same grinding, will frequently require different quantities of liquid. Hence, in a recipe for bread, we give the exact amount of liquid and yeast, allowing more or less flour as required. A little practice will soon determine the quantity of flour needed, so that the housewife may always have bread of uniform quality.</p><p>THE LIQUIDS used for bread making may be milk, water, half milk and half water, or whey. With our present system of milling, potatoes added to the sponge make an inferior quality of bread; and the water in which potatoes are boiled frequently contains a poisonous alkaloid, and should not be used for bread moistening. During the summer months, or where hard coal fires are kept over night, the liquids may be used cool, or just tepid, not over a temperature of 90&#176; Fahr. In winter, about 98&#176; Fahr. To make good, wholesome sweet bread do not use such materials as lard, butter<pb n="490" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=562"/> or sugar. If the yeast is of poor quality, that is, if you are doubtful about its activity, add a little sugar. Good bread cannot be made from poor yeast, but the sugar will aid the growth of the few living plants present, and make the bread a little more porous. It is the least of two evils. Such materials as lard or butter retard the action of yeast, and prevent the bread from being sweet and wholesome. Salt, in small quantities, acts as a "guard keeper," holding the action of the yeast; too much salt will overpower the yeast and make the bread heavy. Personally I use a little salt only in warm weather. Bread sponged over night with home-made or bakers' yeast is liable to sour in warm weather; hence, it is desirable to add salt, but where all the materials are of the best, salt is unnecessary.</p><p><emph rend="bold">YEAST</emph> 
<emph rend="italic">(Saccharomyces)</emph> Yeasts are living plants belonging to the fungi, plants devoid of 
<emph rend="italic">chlorophyll;</emph> the variety best adapted to <ingredient>bread</ingredient> making is 
<emph rend="italic">Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</emph> The conditions of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> making are such that it is impossible to have an absolutely pure <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> In the first place, neither the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> the vessels in which the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is made, the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> nor the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> is sterile, and the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> has been handled; all these prevent a pure culture; and the wild yeasts and bacteria floating constantly in the air, mingle more or less with the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> sponge. In fact, there is made in this country a light <ingredient>bread</ingredient> called <ingredient>salt</ingredient> rising or "emptyings" <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> in which the housewife depends entirely upon the <ingredient>wild yeast</ingredient> plants of the air and the accompanying bacteria. This is called "leaven" <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> The "leaven" is the <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-rising. Many persons have used this <ingredient>bread</ingredient> for years and still feel that it is preferable to <ingredient>yeast bread.</ingredient> Those who speak in its favor, are persons who have never studied bacteriology. It keeps moist (if moist breads are desirable, and I doubt it,) longer than <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> breads.</p> 
<p>Chemists have given, and are still giving, much time and thought to the cultivation of pure yeasts, and to the selections of varieties best adapted to <ingredient>beer</ingredient> and <ingredient>bread</ingredient> making.</p><p>The German, or compressed yeasts, sold in almost every city and town, are fresh and active. Being compressed, each <pb n="491" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=563"/> cake contains much more true <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in a small space, than can be obtained in dry cakes or home made <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> which enables the busy housewife to make good <ingredient>bread</ingredient> quickly and easily.</p><p>Allow only four hours from the beginning of the operation to the baking of the <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> <ingredient>Bread,</ingredient> quickly made, is sweet, light and sightly. When sponged at night, the temperature changes during the standing, and the conditions are not suited to the best growth of the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> plant; such <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is apt to be of an inferior quality.</p><p>As soon as the "sponge" is made, the 
<emph rend="italic">diastase</emph> begins at once to transform <ingredient>starch</ingredient> into <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> upon which the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> "feeds," decomposing it into <ingredient>alcohol</ingredient> and carbon dioxid. The bubbles, carbon dioxid, are held by the batter, giving the mass a light porous appearance. These, with the baking, are chemical changes in <ingredient>bread</ingredient> making. The mixing, beating, kneading and molding, are purely mechanical.</p><p>A perfect loaf should be light and porous, that the digestive secretions may penetrate easily, palatable, and still retain the nutritive principles of the <ingredient>wheat</ingredient> grain, well baked, to rupture the <ingredient>starch</ingredient> cells and to kill the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> plant; and the loaf should be sightly, with a crisp, thin, light brown crust.</p><p><emph rend="bold">MANIPULATION</emph> Thoroughly mix the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> liquid and <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> This is best accomplished first by beating, then kneading. Each little grain of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> must be carefully surrounded by <ingredient>water</ingredient> to hydrate the <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> dissolve the natural <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> of the <ingredient>wheat,</ingredient> and moisten the glutin. This kneading makes the glutin elastic, and causes the constituents to adhere one to the other, forming a fine grained dough. In most households, I am very sorry to say, the hands are still used for the purpose of kneading. A kneading machine is much more hygienic. It is almost impossible to make the hands sterile, and at the same time safe for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> kneading. Materials for the thorough cleansing of the hands would be poisonous to the food. Small <ingredient>bread</ingredient>-kneading machines for family use can be purchased from $4.50 to $10, and are certainly desirable.</p><pb n="492" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=564"/><p>The longer the batter is beaten, the less time is required for kneading. When the dough becomes elastic and loses its stickiness, it is said to be sufficiently worked. The excellence of the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> the shape of the loaf, the even distribution of the air cells, and the elasticity of the dough, depend upon the thoroughness of the kneading.</p><p>The next operation, the molding, is of equal importance. After the dough is very light, it should be molded carefully. It does not require a second kneading. The molding is simply to shape it into loaves to fit the pans selected for the baking.</p><p><emph rend="bold">BAKING</emph> The ideal loaf should not weigh over one and a half pounds when put in the pan; the perfect <ingredient>bread</ingredient> pan is made of Russian iron, size, four inches at the top, three at the bottom, and nine inches long.</p><p>The <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> plant is destroyed at a temperature of 212&#176; Fahr. It is quite impossible to bring the centre of a large loaf of <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> even in a very hot oven, to this temperature. For this reason, small loaves are preferable. Two loaves cannot be baked in the same pan to advantage. In breaking them apart, one side is exposed to the air without the covering of a crust. Under such circumstances the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will dry quickly, or become tasteless or moldy; the crust is a protection. Plunge a thermometer into the centre of a large loaf, as you take it from the oven; it will in all probability register about 200&#176; Fahr. Such <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is not thoroughly baked, and is unwholesome. Ordinary loaves should be placed in an oven at a temperature of 360&#176; Fahr., and baked for three-quarters of an hour, cooling the oven to 300&#176; Fahr. after twenty minutes' baking. With a register, the "hand" will point to eight for twenty minutes; then cool to seven, and bake at this temperature for twenty minutes longer. Bake rolls and light <ingredient>biscuits</ingredient> in a quick oven, at a temperature of 400&#176; Fahr. With a register, the "hand" will point to nine. All small breads should crust quickly; then the temperature may be reduced about one-third.

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><emph rend="bold">BAKING POWDER BREADS</emph></purpose> During the fermentation, in the process of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> making, an acid material settles, in the form of a crust or scales, on' the sides and bottoms of the casks. It is this material, known as argols, from which <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>tartaric acid</ingredient> are made. The argols are carefully washed, dissolved in <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> and drawn off into copper tanks. As the solution cools, a thick crust forms over the entire surface, which is taken off like <ingredient>cream</ingredient> from the surface of <ingredient>milk;</ingredient> hence, the name, "cream" of the tartar. It is then re-dissolved, purified, filtered, again crystallized, powdered, and sold under the name of "<ingredient>cream of tartar.</ingredient>"</p><p>In the liquid remaining after the "cream" has been taken from the surface, is the <ingredient>tartaric acid,</ingredient> a much stronger acid than the first. <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> is frequently adulterated with <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> <ingredient>alum</ingredient> and other materials, which accounts for the failure of "homemade baking powders." The best commercial powders are, as a rule, well made and free from adulterations; being thoroughly mixed and blended by several boltings, they give much better results than <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda</ingredient> hastily put together by an amateur.</p><p>All baking powders used for <ingredient>bread</ingredient> making yield neutral salts, a portion of which remains in the dough. For this reason, great care must be taken to get the right proportion of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and acid, to form as little residue as possible.</p><p>The acid materials most commonly used for baking powders are <ingredient>cream of tartar,</ingredient> <ingredient>tartaric acid</ingredient> and acid phosphates. The alkaline material is universally bi-<ingredient>carbonate of soda.</ingredient> In some sections of New England, packages marked <ingredient>saleratus</ingredient> (potassium bi-carbonate) are still sold, but all the samples purchased under this name were found to be bi-<ingredient>carbonate of soda.</ingredient></p><p>The true value of <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> depends upon the amount of gas liberated in the dough. Tartaric compounds are expensive, and this induces many housewives to take the cheaper substitutes, usually "<ingredient>alum</ingredient>" powders, which are possibly injurious; the salts formed by the decomposition<pb n="508" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=584"/> of bi-<ingredient>carbonate of soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>alum,</ingredient> are not readily absorbed. All good baking powders contain a small amount of dry <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> as <ingredient>fine flour</ingredient> or <ingredient>cornstarch,</ingredient> which prevents the active ingredients from becoming moist after the box has been opened.</p><p>"Unfilled" powders, those free from <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> lose their activity after being exposed to the atmosphere. The term "<ingredient>baking powder</ingredient>" is usually applied to the dry mixture sold in boxes or bottles.</p><p>Here, however, they will be considered from a much broader standpoint. For instance, a mixture of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> with <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> or <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon juice;</ingredient> all of these mixtures are capable of giving off" carbon dioxid, and have a "leavening" power.</p><p>Our grandmothers used a saltspoonful of bi-<ingredient>carbonate of soda</ingredient> with half an ounce of <ingredient>vinegar,</ingredient> as a leavening to ordinary cakes. <ingredient>Lemon juice</ingredient> will answer the same purpose. All liquid mixtures, however, require deft manipulation, as the gas is evolved so quickly, when the two ingredients come together, that much of the lightness is lost unless they are at once mixed with the batter. For this reason dry powders give the best results. A level teaspoonful of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> added to a pint of New Orleans or Porto Rico <ingredient>molasses,</ingredient> will evolve sufficient gas to lighten a good sized cake. <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda,</ingredient> when mixed with dough, act more deliberately than <ingredient>tartaric acid</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda;</ingredient> but with all these materials work rapidly and bake quickly to get a light, fine grained dough.</p><p>To prevent mishaps, many housewives make whole <ingredient>wheat bread</ingredient> with <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> instead of <ingredient>yeast.</ingredient> This robs it of the tendency to become sour and sodden; in fact, it will keep in a good condition as long as <ingredient>white bread.</ingredient> The <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> loaf is porous and sweet. Carbon dioxid is evolved the same as with <ingredient>yeast;</ingredient> but one of the functions of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> during fermentation is to act, on the albuminoids, and, to a certain extent, on the <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> the result of which imparts to the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> a peculiar, characteristic flavor that cannot be obtained by the use of <ingredient>baking powder.</ingredient></p><p>When <ingredient>cream of tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda</ingredient> are to be substituted for <pb n="509" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=585"/> <ingredient>baking powder,</ingredient> allow one level teaspoonful of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> to three level teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>cream of tartar,</ingredient> in the place of two rounding teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>baking powder.</ingredient> Mix and sift with the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> the same as <ingredient>baking powder.</ingredient></p><p>Use <ingredient>baking powder</ingredient> breads warm, <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> breads cold.</p>

<chapter class1="fruitvegbeans"><pb n="522" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=598"/><p><emph rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">NUTS</emph> The word nut is used to express fruits of trees, enclosed in hard, woody covers, which remain closed even after the fruit is ripe. In some, the fruit is drupaceous. Of the almond, for instance, a drupe, we eat the stone kernel, and reject the pulpy covering; of the peach, a drupe of the same family, we eat the fleshy covering, and cast away the seed or stone with its kernel; the one we call a nut, and the other a fruit.</p><p>Nuts and fruits furnish the principal food for the inhabitants of many countries, and were, no doubt, the food of primitive peoples. To the vegetarian they are indispensable; they furnish his meat, milk and butter. They are palatable, nutritious, and, if well prepared, easy of digestion. Being of vegetable origin, they are free from the danger of disease germs. Their food value is frequently overlooked by Americans, as they are generally served as a dessert. Under such circumstances, they naturally disagree, as one is adding concentrated, highly nutritious food to a heavy dinner. Then, too, Americans eat rapidly and masticate imperfectly. Nuts of all foods require most thorough mastication; in fact, grinding is to be preferred.</p><p>From the general awakening in regard to healthful diet, societies have sprung up all over the world, recommending the use of vegetable foods, especially fruits and nuts. We have well established, both in New York and London, large vegetarian societies, many with separate branches of "fruit and nut eaters." Personally I have tried the experiment, and find it most satisfactory. The difficulty is, one must always eat at home. The untrained cook does not understand "delicate feasting." Nuts must be carefully prepared, and fruits correctly chilled and daintily served.</p><p>Like all other foods, nuts are divided into three classes: Nitrogenous, carbonaceous and the inorganic, water and mineral matter. In the first group, those containing nitrogen,<pb n="523" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=599"/> which builds the tissues of the body, are peanuts, pecans, English walnuts, hazel, filberts or cobnuts, almonds, pistachio nuts, pinon and hickory nuts in general. Black walnuts, butter-nuts, Brazil nuts, souari and cocoanuts are oleaginous (rich in oil), heat and energy producers. The chestnut and the chinquapin are the only starchy nuts in common use; hence must always be cooked when used as food for man. The almonds, pine or pinon and peanuts, widely used in all countries, contain all three elements in goodly proportions. Pine-nuts are cheap, easily digested and nutritious. The high price of almonds places them among the luxuries, appetizers, digesters and flavorings. A few almonds, carefully blanched and dried, not cooked or fried, well masticated, at the end of a dinner, aid digestion.</p><p>The common acorns are of many varieties, and are extensively used by the Indians in the West and Southwest; they are dried, ground and made into bread, which, when properly cooked, is palatable, and furnishes the only bread used by many of the tribes during certain seasons of the year.</p><p><emph rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">ALMOND</emph> 
<emph rend="italic">(Prunus Amygdalus, Baill.)</emph> The <ingredient>almond </ingredient>is the <ingredient>seed</ingredient> of a tropical <ingredient>evergreen,</ingredient> widely cultivated throughout the warmer climates of the Old World, and is now being cultivated to some extent in Southern California. It belongs to that group of the great rose family, which also includes the <ingredient>peach</ingredient> and <ingredient>plum.</ingredient> The <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> of the <ingredient>almond </ingredient>appears in a soft, pulpy envelope covered with a rather woolly or soft <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> the same as the <ingredient>peach.</ingredient> The pulpy envelope, however, soon becomes dry, and when the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> matures, cracks open, allowing the pits to fall to the ground. The trees differ in size, color of blossoms, and in shape and size of the leaf. The <ingredient>peach</ingredient> has rather a small pink blossom, while that of the <ingredient>almond </ingredient>is larger and of a pale rose color. Both appear in the early spring before the unfolding of the leaves.</p><p>The <ingredient>almond </ingredient>is one of the oldest of <ingredient>nuts.</ingredient> A history of plants, three hundred years before the Christian era, mentions the <ingredient>almond </ingredient>as the only tree producing flowers before leaves. There<pb n="524" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=600"/> are many varieties of <ingredient>almond,</ingredient> but for our purpose, two only need be considered?-the sweet and the <ingredient>bitter almond.</ingredient></p><p>The <ingredient>sweet almonds</ingredient> are known as "<ingredient>paper</ingredient> shell," "hard" and "Jordan." The <ingredient>Jordan almond</ingredient> comes from Malaga, not from the Valley of the Jordan, as is usually supposed. They are always sold in our markets shelled; are large, sweet and the most expensive, and perhaps the most desirable of all varieties. The "<ingredient>paper</ingredient> shell" and most of the <ingredient>bitter almonds</ingredient> come from Valencia. The bitter brown <ingredient>skin</ingredient> underneath the shell, covering the kernel, contains tannic acid; hence must be removed before the <ingredient>nut</ingredient> is eaten. The <ingredient>bitter almond</ingredient> contains a bitter substance, 
<emph rend="italic">amygdalin,</emph> which, under the influence of the 
<emph rend="italic">enzyme, emulsin,</emph> in the presence of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> produces poisonous compounds, of which hydrocyanic or prussic acid is the chief constituent. Hence, <ingredient>bitter almonds</ingredient> must be used most carefully, in very small quantities, simply as a flavoring. Even then, I doubt if it is wise to use poisonous material.</p><p>The kernel of the <ingredient>peach</ingredient> stone corresponds very nearly to the <ingredient>bitter almond,</ingredient> which makes it equally dangerous to use as a flavoring. The <ingredient>sweet almond</ingredient> contains 
<emph rend="italic">emulsin,</emph> but not sufficient 
<emph rend="italic">amygdalin</emph> to be, in the slightest degree, poisonous.</p><p>Many products of economic value are made from <ingredient>almonds,</ingredient> among which are <ingredient>almond oil,</ingredient> a sweet, bland, non-irritating <ingredient>oil,</ingredient> and <ingredient>almond </ingredient>meal.</p><p><ingredient>Almonds</ingredient> rank high in nitrogen, containing from twenty-four to twenty-five per cent., and when dry, as we use them in this country, are much more concentrated.

<chapter><hd rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">SERVING OF FRUITS</hd><p>During the warm months substitute fruits for the heavier starches, sugars and meats. To have them wholesome and easy of digestion, serve them plain, uncooked and ripe. Small fruits, as strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, huckleberries and currants should be moderately chilled; over-chilling renders them severely acid and unpalatable. The sub-acids or sweet fruits, as mulberries, guavas, bananas, cantaloupes and watermelons, should be served quite cold; peaches medium. The small, soft fruits should be handled as little and as lightly as possible. If sandy, wash them by putting them into a colander and dipping the colander down and up several times in a pan of cold water. Strawberries should be washed before they are hulled, otherwise they become water-soaked. Do not, under any circumstances, throw the fruit into the water and lift them out with the hands.</p><p>In almost every community leaves from fruit trees or leaves from appropriate flowers may be secured for the garnishing of fruits. Even in the woods or on the mountain side the dainty huckleberry leaves or ferns are always accessible. The French, who pay attention to the beautiful, use artificial leaves where fresh leaves are not to be obtained, and while this is not to be recommended as artistic, the beautiful is always to be considered. "The beautiful is frequently as useful as the useful."</p><p>For breakfast, or first course at lunch, strawberries are by far daintier served with the hulls on, around a little mound of powdered sugar. To eat, simply dip them in the powdered sugar, holding the berries by the stem or hull.</p><p>All fruits contain sufficient sugar; that is, according to nature's way of doing. If they are too acid to be palatable they are too acid to be eaten. This is nature's way of warning us against unwholesome foods. Sugar in no way corrects an<pb n="illustration" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=619"/>

A marble slab is, of course, best; but you can very well use the ordinary wood or metal board. All pastry is improved by being kept on ice over night, or several hours before using. <ingredient>puff paste</ingredient> must be kept twenty-four hours, and is better at the end of four days, provided it is carefully wrapped. Of course, the layers of light <ingredient>paste</ingredient> are thin, but each layer is dense and should never be eaten by persons with weak digestion. All forms of so-called pie crust are to be condemned; for this reason the department is necessarily small.</p>

Put the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> into the bowl in the <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> wash or work it under the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> without pressing it into the bowl, until it becomes soft and elastic. Take off a piece the size of a large <ingredient>hen's egg;</ingredient> pat the remaining quantity into a thin sheet, and lay it on a piece of cheesecloth on the ice.

Cut the dough into halves; roll each half out into a sheet a half inch thick. Dry the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on the cheesecloth; dust it with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> on both sides; put it on one sheet, cover it with the other, fastening the edges together, and roll quickly, from you, being careful not to break the dough. Fold in the sides, then the ends, turning the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> around so that the fold will run to and from you; roll from you, and again fold as before. Place on a dry napkin, then on a dish and on the ice for fifteen minutes. Then roll again, having the fold in the same position; fold and roll again. Stand it on the ice for another fifteen minutes. Do this until you have given it six rolls or turns; eight will make it lighter, if you know how to roll; but, if it is your first trial, six will be quite sufficient. Wrap it in a dry napkin, put it on a plate and in the refrigerator over night.</p>

<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" placement="heading"><emph rend="bold">TO BAKE puff paste</emph></purpose> This is quite as important as the making; everything must be very cold. The <ingredient>paste</ingredient> must be rolled quickly, cut into pat&#233;s or vol-au-vent, placed on the ice until thoroughly chilled. The oven must be at least 400&#176; Fahr. It may be cooled slightly after the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> has risen, as it scorches easily; but it is best to have the oven about 4000 at first. As soon as the pastry has risen, cool down the oven to 360&#176; Fahr. For pat&#233;s and vol-au-vent, the oven should have a strong under-heat, allowing them to go to the fullest height before browning. If the oven, however, is too hot, the pastry will brown before it is light, and be dense and heavy, no matter how well made.</p>

With another cutter, three sizes smaller, cut the centres from two-thirds of the rounds, leaving one-third uncut for the bottoms of the pat&#233;s; brush the solid one near the edge with <ingredient>white of egg,</ingredient> put on a ring, brush this with <ingredient>white of egg;</ingredient> put on the other ring; brush the centre of the ring with a little <ingredient>yolk of egg</ingredient> mixed with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> being careful that the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> does not run down the sides of the pat&#233;, or it will cement and hold the edges together. Place these on an oiled <ingredient>paper</ingredient> on a baking sheet. When you have finished the last pat&#233;, stand them on the ice until very cold. During this time, heat the oven. Place the cold pat&#233;s in a very hot oven (about 400&#176; Fahr.), and watch carefully that the heat does not increase; in fact, it is better to decrease it just a little, and bake slowly until they have risen to five or six times their original height. To keep the pat&#233;s perfectly straight, cut a wedge of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> from a thick slice with the small cutter used for making the rings; put this <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in the pat&#233;s just as you are putting them in the oven, or before placing them on the ice. When the pat&#233;s are half baked, remove the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> wedges and allow the inner portion to bake. Pat&#233;s may be baked several hours before they are wanted and warmed at serving time, or they may be made the day before. When wanted for use, rub the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>flour</ingredient> together, add the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> cold, stir until boiling, add the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> the <ingredient>mushrooms</ingredient> chopped fine and the <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> cut into dice. Stand over <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> for fifteen or twenty minutes. At serving time, fill this into the pat&#233;s, and send at once to the table. The centres of the rings may be baked and used as lids for the pat&#233;s.</p><p><ingredient>OYSTER</ingredient> PAT&#233;S are made in precisely the same way, using creamed <ingredient>oysters.</ingredient> Put two <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>sauce</ingredient> in each pat&#233;.</p><p><ingredient>SWEETBREAD</ingredient> PAT&#233;S are made the same as <ingredient>chicken</ingredient> pat&#233;s.

When all is moistened, so that it holds together, turn it out on a board, roll quickly from you, fold in the sides and then the ends, turn, roll it from you again, fold, and roll again. Stand on the ice until wanted. This will be lighter if allowed to stand over night. At first, it will stick to the rolling pin. Don't use sufficient <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to prevent sticking, however, or the pastry will be <ingredient>hard;</ingredient> let it stick at first; in a moment, it will all cleave together under the weight of the roller, and the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> will be light and delicate. This <ingredient>paste</ingredient> may be made by using half <ingredient>lard</ingredient> and half <ingredient>butter;</ingredient> but, of course, it is greasy and not so light. However, it makes very little difference what <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is used as far as digestion is concerned. <ingredient>Butter,</ingredient> perhaps, is quite as injurious as <ingredient>lard,</ingredient> as both are overheated. It is not that <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is injurious, or the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> or <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> from which the pies are made; but it is the combination and the manner in which they are put together. <ingredient>Butter,</ingredient> however, makes a flaky crust, while <ingredient>lard</ingredient> makes a greasy one. This is due to the difference in the fats. Digestion is as easily accomplished, however, with one as with the other, when made into pastry.</p>

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><hd rend="bold" align="center">DESSERTS</hd><p>This term is generally applied to the final sweet at either lunch or dinner. Desserts are like unto the ruffles or trimmings on a garment; they must be used with judgment or they will spoil the entire, meal. Avoid heavy desserts where meats have formed a large proportion of the dinner; light desserts not containing albuminoids are to be preferred. For instance, with a roast-beef dinner, do not serve a cup custard or a dessert rich in eggs, or the dinner will be unbalanced, containing entirely too much nitrogenous foods. Substitute whipped cream, light cornstarch, or fruits. With a vegetable dinner, serve desserts rich in eggs and milk. Like all other trimmings, these can be overdone; a dessert must above all things har-monize with the dinner. For instance, do not end a simple dinner with an elaborate dessert, and when a dinner is very elaborate, it is by far better to omit the dessert and serve coffee, wafers and cheese, or an omelette soufflee or syllabub, a dainty, light, attractive dish</p><p>Don't for example, serve apple slump or bread pudding with a capon or turkey dinner; nor tapioca, following a baked fillet with mushroom sauce. It would be like a velvet gown trimmed with calico.</p><p><emph rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">A GROUP OF COLD PUDDINGS</emph> These puddings may be made a day before they are needed, and consist principally of "gelatin desserts" and those thickened with cornstarch or eggs.

<chapter class1="breadsweets"><pb n="613" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=705"/><hd rend="bold" align="center">CAKES</hd><p>Cakes contain both carbonaceous and nitrogenous foods; nitrogenous, in the form of eggs and milk; carbonaceous, in the flour, butter and sugar. All ingredients used are perfectly wholesome, if used separately, but when mixed together and baked, become complex and difficult of digestion. Cakes without butter are much more wholesome than those with butter, as the heating of the butter renders it more difficult of digestion. Hence, people with weak digestion can use sponge cake, angel food, sunshine cake with greater ease than pound, fruit or layer cakes. Cakes are digested in the mouth, stomach and small intestines.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">RULES FOR CAKE MAKING</hd><p>In making cake, accuracy in measuring the ingredients is absolutely necessary. Success follows those who give strict attention to detail. The baking is usually the most difficult part. Eggs must be perfectly fresh; butter sweet, and flour fine. Butter cakes, as pound cake, cup cake and fruit cake, must be baked in a very moderate oven (220&#176; Fahr.), while layer cakes may be baked more quickly (from 280&#176; to 300&#176; Fahr.). Angels' food and sunshine cake should be placed in a very cool oven (212&#176; Fahr.), the heat increased slowly for three-quarters of an hour, browning at the last. Do not beat the butter, sugar and eggs in a tin basin; it scours the basin, but discolors the materials. Use a wooden spoon and a white enameled bowl.</p><p>Measure everything before beginning.</p><p>Always separate the whites and the yolks of the eggs, unless the recipe specifically directs otherwise.</p><p>Beat the butter to a cream before adding the sugar; then beat the sugar and butter until very light before adding the eggs.</p><pb n="614" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=706"/><p>When a recipe calls for a teaspoonful of baking powder, it always means a rounding teaspoonful, unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Each teaspoonful of baking powder may be replaced by a half teaspoonful of soda (level) and a level teaspoonful of cream of tartar sifted with the flour three or four times.</p><p>Dried fruits, as currants and raisins, must be perfectly clean and well floured, and added to the cakes at the last moment.</p><p>If fruits sink to the bottom of the cake, the cake is not sufficiently thick to hold them in place; add more flour to the batter.</p><p>Cups used for measuring hold a half pint.</p><p>Suet is the best material for greasing cake pans. Butter burns easily, sticks and holds the cake to the pan.</p><p>Have the oven ready as soon as the cake is mixed.</p><p>Cookies, thin small cakes as wafers, require a moderately quick oven (240&#176; Fahr.); molasses cakes, a very moderate oven (220&#176; Fahr.), as they scorch easily.</p><p>If you are without a thermometer, and must guess at the heat of the oven (a most unsatisfactory way), and you find it too hot, quickly lift the lids of the stove and put a pan of cold water into the oven. Cakes baked too quickly at first will come up in the centre, crack and run over the sides of the pan. It is almost impossible to keep them in shape.</p><p>Do not jar the stove, or open and close the oven door until the centre of the cake is "set."</p><p>Do not cover a cake with paper; the paper burns and spoils the flavor of the cake.</p><p>Regulate your oven. If necessary to look at a cake while baking, do it as quickly as possible, and open and close the door carefully.</p><p>In recipes, where time is given for baking, remember it is gauged by a thermometer, and it is impossible for you to follow correctly without one. Be careful, then, that the cake is thoroughly done before you take it from the oven. If it is not, it will tick loudly when you put your ear to it, and will fall when taken out, having a heavy streak near the bottom.</p><p>It is always well to line the pans with greased paper for fruit cake, pound cake, wedding cake and cakes rich in butter.</p><pb n="615" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=707"/><p>When a cake is done, turn it gently on a cake sieve and allow it to cool. Do not handle it while hot.</p><p>Do not melt or warm the butter until it is oily. It may be slightly softened in warm water.</p>

<chapter class1="beverages"><hd rend="bold" align="center">BEVERAGES</hd><p>Under this heading, we should place water only, as it alone fulfills the place of a true beverage. The body is seventy-five per cent, water, and this amount must be rigidly kept up to produce a healthy condition. In the very young and aged, the amount is slightly increased. It is quite common to hear elderly persons remark that they are cold; their blood is thin. This is true in a way, as there is usually more water in proportion even when the body is lighter in weight.</p><p>Tea and coffee are not beverages when saturated with sugar and cream or milk. They must be taken as food and ranked as such. Chocolate is called a beverage, probably because it is served in a cup and taken with food. This, however, is a great mistake. A cup of well-made chocolate or cocoa contains sufficient food for the ordinary breakfast. Children who are compelled to eat a large plate of oatmeal and with it a cup of chocolate, find it difficult to do their morning's school work without headache. Such children break down easily, and become nervous. Tea, coffee and chocolate each contain an alkaloid, which is more or less stimulating, and chocolate is quite as bad as tea and coffee. The 
<emph rend="italic">caffein</emph> of <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> the thein of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> and the 
<emph rend="italic">theobromin</emph> of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> are all stimulants. Coming now to our markets, we have Paraguay <ingredient>tea,</ingredient> Yerba Mat&#233;, the leaves and twigs of the Paraguay Ilex, a tree belonging to the holly family. Mat&#233; contains an alkaloid identical with 
<emph rend="italic">thein.</emph> Of the two, however, Mat&#233; seems to be the more stimulating. With the exception of <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> or <ingredient>cocoa,</ingredient> both containing <ingredient>starch,</ingredient> all beverages should be infused very lightly. <ingredient>Coffee,</ingredient> so rigidly condemned by the average physician, is far less objectionable when carefully made. The serious and unpleasant results come from the use of heavy decoctions, made by boiling.

In selecting a pot choose one with a top or second story, in which the grounds are held, above the <ingredient>water.</ingredient> All pots are to be condemned where the grounds are dropped or held in the infusion.

Like <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> it seems to take the flavor of other materials with which it comes in contact. The bag will taste of <ingredient>soap,</ingredient> and if it is once scalded in <ingredient>soap suds,</ingredient> it is practically useless again for <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> making. If possible, clean new <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> cloth should be scalded, ironed and put aside, and a new bag made each week.

<chapter class1="accompaniments"><hd rend="bold" align="center">JELLY MAKING AND PRESERVING</hd><p>Before attempting to make jelly, one should become perfectly familiar with the character and the peculiarities of sugar. The numerous varieties of sugar may be roughly divided into three groups.</p><list><item>SACCHAROSES</item><item>C12H22O11</item><item>Sucrose (cane sugar)</item><item>Maltose (malt sugar)</item><item>Lactose (milk sugar)</item><item>GLUCOSES</item><item>C6H12O6</item><item>Dextrose</item><item>Grape sugar</item><item>Levulose (fruit sugar)</item><item>AMYLOSES</item><item>C6H10O5</item><item>Starch</item><item>Gum</item><item>Dextrin</item><item>Inulin</item><item>Cellulose</item></list><p>We are principally concerned, in the household, with cane sugar. I do not believe the ordinary glucose is wholesome for continued use. We know so little about its action that it is far better to let it alone for the time being. Under the head of true sugar or saccharoses, we find also maple and beet sugar. In the same group are several different sugars, and while they are represented by the same symbols, they are not equally influenced by the digestive ferments. For instance, yeast acts quickly on a thin solution of cane sugar, converting it first into alcohol and then into acetic acid.</p><p>In this same group we have lactose (milk sugar), upon which yeast has apparently little or no effect. For this reason, in making koumys (a fermented milk food) a small amount of cane sugar must be added to produce the desired results.</p><p>Maltose is formed by the action of the 
<emph rend="italic">enzyme ptyalin</emph> in the saliva, and the 
<emph rend="italic">enzyme amylopsin</emph> in the pancreatic secretions, on the starches during the process of digestion. <ingredient>Cane sugar</ingredient> may be changed into dextrose during digestion?-glucose is a dextrose?-but let us do this laboratory work by natural process. The glucose of commerce, an impure dextrose, is very liable to unnatural fermentations in the stomach and<pb n="641" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=738"/> intestines. Granting it to be a pure product, it is a result of the digestion outside of the body. As such it is still objectionable. We do not need, when in a normal, healthful condition, predi-gested foods.</p><p>Glucose is made by boiling <ingredient>cornstarch</ingredient> with dilute <ingredient>sulphuric acid.</ingredient> It is then neutralized with <ingredient>lime,</ingredient> drawn off, and after settling into a clear, thin <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient> is evaporated to the desired thickness and sold under the name of glucose. It frequently comes to our table as "drips" or "table <ingredient>syrup.</ingredient>" In the solid, <ingredient>sugar</ingredient>-like form, it is sold under the name of <ingredient>grape sugar.</ingredient> It is far less sweet than <ingredient>cane sugar,</ingredient> and is more expensive at half the price.</p><p>If an acid <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or a <ingredient>fruit juice</ingredient> is boiled with <ingredient>cane sugar,</ingredient> the <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> in the presence of heat and moisture, and under the influence of the acid, is split into two <ingredient>sugars,</ingredient> one-half of which is dextrose, the other half levulose, invert <ingredient>sugars.</ingredient> The latter <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is usually in a <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> form, and dextrose is difficult of crystallization. Levulose is deadly sweet, and this is why <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> are so much sweeter than <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> with the same amount of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> sprinkled over them. Thin, <ingredient>syrup</ingredient>-like <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> has been boiled too long; the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has "split," and you have a <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> rather than a <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient> The more acid a <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> contains, the more difficult to make a <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient></p><p>In <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> making, if the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is overripe, and a pound of <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is added to a pint of <ingredient>juice,</ingredient> crystals are formed, from the excess of <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> throughout the cooling <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient> This is especially true of <ingredient>grapes.</ingredient> We do not depend upon the acid of the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> for <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> making, but the amount of pectose the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> contains.

Over-ripe <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> are not easily made into <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient> Pectose, an insoluble body existing in many <ingredient>fruits,</ingredient> especially if they are a little under-ripe, will, by the natural ferments of the <ingredient>fruits,</ingredient> be converted into pectin. Pectin does not readily unite with <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to form a <ingredient>jelly.</ingredient> Pectose does.

<chapter class1="servants"><hd rend="bold">TABLE WAITING?OR HOW TO</hd><hd rend="bold">TRAIN THE WAITRESS</hd><hd rend="bold" align="center">A COURSE DINNER</hd><p>Perhaps it is unnecessary to say that a long course dinner must never be undertaken by those who keep only one or two servants. To have the conventional dinner a success, dishes must be well-cooked, delicately seasoned, handsomely garnished and properly served. Hot dishes must come to the table smoking 
<emph rend="italic">hot</emph> and be served on hot plates. Cold dishes must be 
<emph rend="italic">cold</emph> and served on cold plates. <ingredient>White</ingredient> dishes must be <ingredient>white,</ingredient> and brown dishes that <ingredient>chestnut</ingredient> brown color, given only by artistic cooking. Where only one servant is kept, a small, three-course dinner is much more satisfactory; in fact, a <ingredient>crust of bread</ingredient> and a cup of <ingredient>tea</ingredient> daintily and handsomely served is much more hospitable than an elaborate dinner badly served in an ill-heated and ill-lighted room. Even the conventional dinner served by well trained servants should have the number of its guests limited; it is far better to give three dinners to six guests than one to eighteen. The success of a dinner, large or small, depends upon the selection of the guests. Brilliant conversation is really the dinner. The host and hostess should be as free from the thought of the routine of a dinner as any guest at the table, otherwise the dinner is a failure. At a formal dinner, conventional etiquette must be strictly observed. Rules have been formulated that cannot be neglected or overlooked; the form of invitation, the manner of seating the guests, and even the garnishing and serving of the dishes must conform to these accepted rules. In large establishments, where every dinner is well served, there is no change in the general routine. One may add an entr&#233;e or a <ingredient>game</ingredient> course without changing the general plan of the daily meal. The ordinary home dinner, in nine out of ten families, consists of soup followed by <ingredient>meat</ingredient><pb n="654" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=753"/> with two vegetables, then a salad course with wafers and <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> the dessert and <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient> You may call this if you like, five courses. <ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> is frequently brought in with the dessert. To elongate this dinner, to make it rather more pretentious, add a <ingredient>fish</ingredient> course, or serve <ingredient>game</ingredient> with the salad. Such a dinner would be sufficiently elegant, no matter to whom served.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">THE COMPANY DINNER</hd><p>The hostess should hand her bill of fare to the cook at least four days before the dinner party. All instructions should be carefully written. If she has a waitress of whom she is not sure, let the instructions for her also be carefully written. If a butler is employed he will know how to serve, but must be acquainted with that especial bill of fare in order to select the proper china.</p><p>An eight-course dinner, simply, quickly and elegantly served, will require about one and a half to two hours; every moment over this is a discomfort. In arranging the bill of fare, be most cautious in the choice of dishes. Select those in season, foods that are actually fresh, as well as those harmonizing with the occasion and surroundings. If <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> an entr&#233;e, a <ingredient>meat</ingredient> course and <ingredient>game</ingredient> are served, make sure that the dessert is light, sightly and appetizing. Syllabub garnished with chopped <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> an omelette soufflee, or a handsome Charlotte Russe are to be preferred. The dining-room must be well-lighted, well-heated and carefully ventilated.</p><p>Invitations will be sent out two weeks in advance, and must be answered at once; otherwise the hostess is unable to fill the vacant seats, and this spoils the arrangement of the table. Accepted dinner invitations must be rigidly complied with; under no circumstances must a trivial affair prevent the going. If there is any doubt in your mind when accepting, better regret and miss the dinner party than to be discourteous and embarrass the hostess. A dinner invitation may be accepted or regretted formally. A little informal note, however, when the invitation cannot be accepted, is much more pleasing to the<pb n="655" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=754"/> hostess. Well-bred people do not use R. S. V. P. on dinner invitations. Your guests will have sufficient politeness to reply without having their attention abruptly called to it.

</illustration><pb n="657" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=764"/> it were a formal dinner. If you have a butler, he wears for all dinners a dress suit and white tie. If a waitress a plain black dress with broad collar, <ingredient>white</ingredient> cuffs and waitress' apron with bib, and three-pointed waitress' cap. This cap may be perfectly plain white, or have in front a small, black velvet bow.</p><p>Above all things, see that the dinner is ready just at the appointed time, not ten minutes before nor ten minutes after the hour. Be prompt. Nothing is more discouraging to a good cook than a dinner spoiled by over-waiting. A few minutes' grace is allowed to professional men, as physicians. If your company consists of guests of this kind, have the cook allow a grace of ten to fifteen minutes over the appointed hour.</p><p>At large conventional dinners, there is usually placed in the gentlemen's dressing room, a small tray holding envelopes addressed to the gentlemen, containing cards, on which is written the lady's name whom each is to escort to the table. If the dinner is large and the table long, it is wise to note also the side of the table to which he is assigned; for instance, if he is to be seated on the right side of the table, a large R or the word right, if the left, the word left. If a strange lady should be assigned to him, that is a lady to whom he has not been presented, he must make this known to the servant, the servant to the hostess, who will at once "present" him. The waitress or butler keeps a sharp watch out for the arrival of guests. When all have arrived and have had sufficient time in the dressing room, dinner will be announced. The servant will enter just at the parlor door, wait until the hostess recognizes him, and then say quietly, "dinner is served," and, with a bow to the hostess, back out of the room. The host immediately offers his right arm to the most distinguished lady guest, who sits at his right at the table. They lead the way to the dining-room, the remaining guests following, the hostess, with the most distinguished gentleman, waiting until the last. All remain standing at their places at the table, until the hostess arrives. She will be seated immediately, and all will follow. To save confusion, a small dinner card bearing the name of the guest to occupy the place, may be on the napkin or at the left of each cover; have the name written simply and distinctly. If a rose<pb n="658" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=765"/> bud is thrown at the top of the plate, a little bow of ribbon on each stem, may act as a dinner card, the name being written on one end of the ribbon. If menu cards are used, the name may be written across the corner of the menu card. These will then be carried away as souvenirs.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">SERVING AND WAITING AT TABLE</hd><p>A simple, easily prepared menu with a few illustrations may serve to show the accepted methods of serving and waiting at table.</p><p><list><hd rend="bold">MENU</hd><item>OYSTERS ON HALF SHELL</item><item>TOBASCO SAUCE</item><item>HORSERADISH</item><item>LEMON</item><item>THIN <ingredient>CRACKERS</ingredient> OR <ingredient>BROWN BREAD SANDWICHES</ingredient></item><item>CONSOMM&#233; A LA ROYAL</item><item>BREAD STICKS</item><item>BOILED ROCK</item><item>SAUCE HOLLANDAISE</item><item>POTATO BALLS</item><item>CUCUMBERS, FRENCH DRESSING</item><item>SWEETBREAD PATTIES</item><item>ROASTED CAPON</item><item>CHESTNUT STUFFING</item><item>CRANBERRY JELLY</item><item>SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES</item><item>PEAS</item><item>FRENCH SALAD</item><item>CAMEMBERT</item><item>TOASTED CRACKERS</item><item>ALMOND PUDDING</item><item>HARD SAUCE</item><item>COFFEE</item><item>BONBONS</item><item>SALTED ALMONDS</item></list> The cuts illustrate the manner of serving each course, and are not in any way supposed to represent table decorating.</p><p>Cover the table with a spotless, white linen cloth, sufficiently heavy to hang in graceful folds. Never starch table-cloths or napkins. In the centre of the table, place a large vase of roses or any suitable flowers. A basket or a rose jar may be substituted for the vase. Let the centre piece be simple and plain; avoid lace, ruffles or frills. Washable embroideries only are<pb n="659" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=766"/> used on elegant tables. If cut flowers are to be used, select those free from heavy odor and to correspond with the lighting and color of the dining-room. Arrange neatly in small cut glass, silver or china dishes, <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> <ingredient>radishes or celery, salted almonds and bonbons. Serve olives,</ingredient> <ingredient>radishes and celery with sufficient cracked ice to keep them cool. Place the napkin to the left of the plate; knives to the right, blades turned in; nearest the plate the dessert knife, next the meat</ingredient> knife, then the <ingredient>fish knife, then the soup spoon, and on the outside, to the right, the oyster fork, or place it as shown in the diagram. On the left nearest the plate, a dessert fork, then the salad fork, next the meat</ingredient> fork, then a small fork for the entr&#233;e, and last, the <ingredient>fish fork. The service will be used from the outside toward the plate. Butter is not, as a rule, served at dinner, so butter</ingredient> chips or plates are not used. On the right, at the <ingredient>head of the knives, place a tumbler for water and the wine glasses. If wine</ingredient> is not used, place a smaller tumbler for Apol-linaris. All the plates and silver for a dinner must be gotten ready and grouped at least two hours before the serving of the meal. A roll or thick bit of dinner <ingredient>bread may be placed on the napkin. The knife and fork rests are, as you will notice, on the table; also the soup ladle, a spoon for the olives, and a small spoon for the bonbons. If individual salt</ingredient> cellars are used, one will be placed at the head of each plate.</p><p>A cold dinner plate will be placed first; and, just as the meal is announced, smaller plates containing oysters on the half shell, are placed in these. Cover the smaller plate with finely cracked ice, and at the last moment sink or work the shells down in it; put a quarter of a lemon in the centre of the dish.</p><p>As soon as the guests are seated, the waitress will pass, on a small tray, a dish of <ingredient>horseradish,</ingredient> a bottle of <ingredient>tobasco, an extra dish of lemon, and crackers</ingredient> or brown bread sandwiches. She then pours water and Apollinaris.</p><p>A different set of plates may be used for each course; but the guests must never be left without a plate except when crumbing the table after the salad course.</p><pb n="660" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=767"/><p>As soon as the oysters are eaten, the waitress will have near at hand on the sideboard or side table, the soup service. She brings to the table, in her right hand, a warm dinner plate; lifting the oyster plate with her left hand, she immediately places the new service, and so continues until all plates are changed.</p><p>The soup tureen and a few soup dishes are now placed before the hostess who ladles the soup into the plates. The waitress holding the plates, one at a time, on her left hand, close to the left of the soup tureen; when served she places them before the guests from the right with her right hand. She now pours the sherry or <ingredient>Madeira, refills the Apollinaris and water</ingredient> glasses, and passes the celery or radishes; these are served with the soup course. The guests now break the <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> unless they have used it with their oysters, which is permissible.</p><p>The fish is being dished in the kitchen, the sauce strained, and, with the heated <ingredient>fish plates, they are placed in the pantry ready for service. The waitress now removes the soup tureen; coming back, she brings with her the warm fish plates, putting them on the side table. Going to the right of each guest, carrying in her right hand a warm fish plate, removes the soup plates with her left hand, and places the fish</ingredient> plates.</p><p>She now places the <ingredient>fish before the host, the sauce at the left-hand side with a ladle for serving; she places the fish</ingredient> knife on his right, and at his left the fork. When she is going backwards and forwards, she, of course, removes the radishes and <ingredient>celery. She always lifts the plate with her left and replaces it with her right hand. The host carves the fish,</ingredient> helping also the potatoes and sauce. The waitress stands at his left, and has in her hand the extra heated fish plate. As soon as he has served one plate, she lifts it, putting down the extra plate, and carries in her right hand the served plate to the hostess, and with her left hand lifts the plate that is already there. She now returns to the host, lifts the plate in front of him, and with her right hand simply puts down the unfilled plate, and so continues until all are served. An extra plate saves much time. She serves the <ingredient>cucumbers</ingredient> at the side table, and places them at the right of each guest. The sherry glasses used are removed, and a<pb n="661" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=768"/> white wine poured. She observes the glasses, fills those that require filling, and pours the Apollinaris, if necessary. The patties are being placed on dainty little mats, in the centre of a luncheon plate, in the pantry.</p><p>At the end of the fish course, the waitress lifts first the large <ingredient>fish</ingredient> platter and sauce boat and then the cucumber dishes. Coming back, she brings a plate with patty, lifts the fish plate in front of the hostess, and places the patty, and so continues until all are served. Olives may now be passed.</p><p>While this course is being eaten, the meat is being dished and
garnished, also the vegetables. The waitress places the carving knife to the right, the fork and steel to the left, of the host. She brings the warm dinner plates to the side table; when ready she removes, with the left hand, the entr&#233;e plate from in front of the hostess and places a dinner plate, going back to the side table she brings another plate as before, and so changes each plate at the table. She now goes to the pantry, brings in the <ingredient>turkey,</ingredient> and places it in front of the host; returning, she brings the <ingredient>potato </ingredient>croquettes,<ingredient>peas</ingredient> and <ingredient>cranberry jelly.</ingredient> While the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is being carved, she places the necessary silver and refills the glasses, and pours claret or <ingredient>champagne.</ingredient></p><p>If the host does not carve, he simply, by motion, makes this known, and the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> is lifted, carried to the side table, and there carved, then placed in front of the host to serve, or it may be passed to the left of each guest. The waitress lifts a serving spoon from the table, puts it in the <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> rests the dish on the palm of left hand, and, going to the left of each guest, holds it down to the very edge of the dinner plate close to the table, so that one may help one's self easily. She next passes the <ingredient>potato </ingredient>croquettes; then the <ingredient>cranberry jelly.</ingredient> She now passes the <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> and refills the <ingredient>water</ingredient> glasses, keeping a strict eye to the conditions of the table. She slips into the pantry for a moment to see if the salad course is nicely dished, the <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> toasted and the <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> in order. This has all been ordered before dinner, you must remember; but it is well to have it overlooked. She stands near the chair of the hostess, paying no attention to what is going on in the room, but watches the<pb n="662" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=769"/> requirements of each guest; if the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> has been consumed, she passes <ingredient>bread</ingredient> from the sideboard; she may offer vegetables the second time.</p><p>At the end of this course, she lifts the <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> and carries it to the pantry, then the vegetable dishes, then the wineglasses and <ingredient>olives;</ingredient> nothing is now left on the table but the <ingredient>salted almonds</ingredient> and bonbons; the plates are still in front of the guests. She will now bring in a salad plate in her right hand, and with her left lift the dinner plate from in front of the hostess; put down the salad plate, and so continue around the table, serving each course precisely the same. If the salad is dressed at the table, she places it in front of the hostess; on the left hand the <ingredient>lettuce</ingredient> tearer, the salad fork and spoon, <ingredient>olive oil,</ingredient> <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and proper seasonings, with small bowl for mixing. If the salad is dressed outside, she simply places it for a moment in front of the hostess, who will give it an extra mixing. The waitress now lifts the salad dish, arranges the spoon handles to one side, places the bowl on the palm of the left hand, offers it to the left of each guest, allowing them to help themselves. On a small tray, she offers wafers or <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> at the left of each guest.</p><p>At the end of this course, the table is cleared, and for the first time the guests are left without a plate in front of them. After removing the salad bowl and plates, the waitress removes, on a small tray covered with a doily, the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> cellars and all the silver, as odd forks and spoons, from the table. Now, with folded napkin and tray she quickly removes the crumbs. If pieces are left on the table too large to be brushed with the napkin, lift them with a fork, which she will have on the side of the tray for this purpose.</p><p>She now places in front of each, beginning always with the hostess, the dessert plates covered with dainty doilies, on top of which are placed the finger bowls. These will contain a little <ingredient>warm water,</ingredient> scented with violet, or throw in it at the last moment, a leaf of geranium or a dainty flower, with a slice of <ingredient>lemon.</ingredient> She now brings in the dessert, which in this case happens to be a pudding garnished with <ingredient>cherries,</ingredient> and places it in front of the hostess; on the right, a silver cake knife and spoon,<pb n="663" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=770"/> and on the left a serving fork. Each person lifts the bowl with the doily, and places it just to the left of the dessert plate. The hostess dishes a portion of the dessert on the plate in front of her, putting at the side a spoonful of <ingredient>hard sauce.</ingredient> The waitress carries it to the right of the guest in her right hand, and with the left hand lifts the plate that is there. After all are served, she passes <ingredient>salted almonds,</ingredient> and goes to the pantry for the <ingredient>coffee.</ingredient></p><p>On a dainty tray, she brings in the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> placing it at the right of the hostess. The small cups, with spoons, are then placed; the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is poured, the waitress, with a small tray, carries two cups and <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> passing to the left of each guest. She then passes the bonbons, refills the glasses, and leaves the room.</p><p>If <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> is served in the drawing-room or library, the bonbons are passed there. The waitress arranges the cups in the library while the dessert is being finished. She is waiting at the door; when the guests enter the library she follows with the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> tray, an ordinary silver salver, placing it before the hostess; as each cup is filled, she passes it on a small tray, on which she also places the cut <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> She then stands near the door until the hostess gives her the signal for dismissal.</p><p>This same routine is followed out at the smallest as well as at the largest dinners. While this routine may seem complicated to a few, when once established it gives much comfort to the hostess. These directions for table waiting will answer for luncheon or a twelve o'clock breakfast as well as for a dinner.</p>

<chapter><hd rend="bold" align="center">A PLEA FOR THE LITTLE DINNER</hd><p>A dinner engagement, no matter whether the dinner be large or small, formal or informal, is the most exacting of social obligations. Indeed, one feels a double sense of obligation when invited to a small dinner. If, among your friends, are physicians, lawyers and politicians, do not invite one of each class, nor all of one class simply because their professions are the same, but select congenial spirits. Then small, inexpensive dinners, well arranged, are much more enjoyable than one large conventional dinner served to sixty ill-selected persons. The food is better, service better, and digestion better, and even where trained help is not employed, the hostess may enjoy the occasion as well as the guests. The art of dining is quite apart from dinner giving. The person who dines has studied the art of living, lives frugally and elegantly. A reform in dinner giving is, I am pleased to note, being instituted. Simple dinners are now "the correct thing."</p><p>A hostess must never forget that, during the short time her guests are under her roof, she is responsible for their happiness and comfort. A huge dinner of twelve courses of badly-blended food is not conducive to either. Savarin said, "The dinner is the place where men are never bored for the first hour;" the insinuation is that the second hour is frequently too long.</p><p>If people in the ordinary walks of life are to make such entertainments a success, they must never try new or elaborate dishes, or even new ways of serving. Simply add an extra plate or two to the usual number, and invite your friends.</p><p>The conventional dinner can only be served in the homes of the very wealthy, and very few of these succeed in doing it well, and but few of their guests enjoy it. Just contemplate for a moment the dinner of ten years ago: Ice-cold oysters in quantity sufficient for a whole meal; hot soup, then fish; rel&#232;ves and entr&#233;es; then a roast, a pause for a highly seasoned,<pb n="665" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=772"/> stimulating punch, to bring the stomach back to life; then game, salad, sweets, and another ice. Then coffee as an antidote, and a warming-pan to the poor, chilled stomach. These were feedings, extravagant, coarse and vulgar.</p><hd rend="bold" align="center">A Few Simple Dinners</hd><list><item>TOMATO SOUP </item> <item>CRO&#219;TONS</item><item>CREAMED FISH </item> <item>POTATO ROSES</item><item>BOILED CHICKEN </item> <item>EGG SAUCE</item><item>RICE </item> <item>PEAS</item><item>LETTUCE SALAD</item><item>WAFERS </item> <item>NEUFCHATEL CHEESE</item><item>WHIPPED CREAM </item> <item>LADY FINGERS</item><item>COFFEE</item><item>CLEAR SOUP</item><item>BROILED STEAK </item> <item>MUSHROOM SAUCE </item><item>STUFFED POTATOES </item> <item>SPINACH</item><item>CHICORY SALAD </item><item>EDUCATORS </item> <item>CREAM CHEESE</item><item>COFFEE </item><item>SALTED ALMONDS </item> <item>MINT WAFERS</item><item>CLEAR SOUP </item> <item>BREAD STICKS</item><item>MACARONI CROQUETTES </item><item>TOMATO SAUCE</item><item>STUFFED LEG OF MUTTON </item> <item>BROWN SAUCE</item><item>COLD ASPARAGUS</item><item>WAFERS </item> <item>CHEESE</item><item>COFFEE</item><pb n="666" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=773"/><item>OYSTER AND CELERY SOUP</item><item>ROASTED TURKEY </item> <item>CRANBERRY SAUCE</item><item>SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES</item> <item>CREAMED ONIONS</item><item>CELERY SALAD </item> <item>TOAST FINGERS</item><item>ITALIAN CREAM</item><item>COFFEE</item><item>GRAPE FRUIT</item><item>ROASTED LAMB </item> <item>MINT SAUCE</item><item>NEW POTATOES </item> <item>CREAM SAUCE</item><item>PEAS</item><item>COLD ASPARAGUS </item> <item>FRENCH DRESSING</item><item>CAMMEMBERT </item> <item>WATER CRACKERS</item><item>COFFEE</item></list><hd rend="bold" align="center">Fast Day Dinner</hd><list><item>CREAM OF SPINACH SOUP </item><item>BAKED FISH </item> <item>SAUCE HOLLANDAISE</item><item>POTATOES</item><item>TINY CRAB CROQUETTES </item> <item>LETTUCE SALAD</item><item>WAFERS </item> <item>CHEESE</item><item>COFFEE</item><hd rend="bold" align="center">Vegetarian</hd><item>PEANUT SOUP</item><item>BEAN CROQUETTES </item> <item>TOMATO SAUCE</item><item>CAULIFLOWER OR CABBAGE </item> <item>MACARONI</item><item>CELERY SALAD</item><item>WAFERS </item> <item>CHEESE</item><item>APPLES WITH RICE</item><item>COFFEE</item></list><pb n="667" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=774"/>

<chapter><hd rend="bold" align="center">SERVING DINNER WITHOUT A MAID</hd><p>This is, of course, a difficult task, but it can be done if thought is given to the first arrangements. Have but few people; it is better to have two small dinners than one large one. Prepare the soup, a consomm&#233;, the day before.

<p>The dinner hour is six o'clock.</p><p>After finishing the usual morning work, put parlor and dining-room in order, go to the kitchen and begin the preparations for the dinner. Wash the <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> shake, and put it aside in a damp cloth on the ice or in the cellar. Make the <ingredient>jelly</ingredient> and custard, and put them in the cold. Next make the <ingredient>potato </ingredient>croquettes. While the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient>are boiling, singe, draw, cut up the <ingredient>chickens</ingredient> and arrange them at once in the baking pan; put the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> over, and stand them aside. Make the croquettes; fry and put them at once into a baking pan lined with <ingredient>paper.</ingredient> They are now ready to run in a hot oven to heat just a moment before serving time. Shell the <ingredient>peas,</ingredient> and make the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> balls. This preparatory work will take about an hour and a half. Then take <pb n="668" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=775"/> your luncheon and rest awhile. At three o'clock go to the dining-room and arrange the table. On the side table put the <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> and the necessary extra silver. This may be a small table at your left in reaching distance, that you may serve without moving from your chair. Place on it also the salad and dessert plates. On the side-board arrange the cups and saucers, and leave a place for the dessert. All being in readiness, fix the kitchen fire, and then go to your room and put the necessary finishing touches to your toilet. Put on a large pair of sleevelets and an apron, and at five o'clock begin the cooking of the dinner.</p> 
<p>Add a pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> and put it in the hot oven; in a half hour, add a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and baste it. At half-past five o'clock, put the <ingredient>peas</ingredient> over to cook. Turn out the dessert and place it on the side-board. Arrange the <ingredient>lettuce;</ingredient> make the French dressing, put it in a pretty bowl, and put both on the side table. Put the <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> in the pot, and see that the teakettle is rilled. At a quarter of six put the croquettes in the oven and the consomm&#233; over to heat. Then put the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on the table. Remove your apron, receive the guests and slip back to the kitchen. Dish the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> make a <ingredient>cream sauce</ingredient> in the pan, and stand the platter where it will keep hot. Drain, season and dish the <ingredient>peas.</ingredient> Dish the croquettes. Pour the soup in the tureen, carry it to the table and announce dinner. Place the warm plates, also the <ingredient>chicken,</ingredient> which should be prettily garnished with curled <ingredient>parsley,</ingredient> in front of the host. Then take your seat, and resume conversation as though you had not left the table. At the end of this course, remove the plates and large dishes quickly to the kitchen. While there, pour the <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> over the <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> allowing it to stand over a pan of <ingredient>hot water.</ingredient> Be seated. First lift the <ingredient>crackers</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> and place them on the table. Place the salad plates in front of you; pour the dressing over the <ingredient>lettuce,</ingredient> mix and serve it.

<chapter><p><emph rend="bold">A GROUP OF SPANISH RECIPES</emph></p><p><emph rend="bold">TAMALES</emph> Singe, draw and truss a three-pound chicken; cook slowly, in sufficient water to cover, until tender, adding salt when partly done. Open six large red chillies; wash, rejecting the seeds, cut into halves, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly until perfectly soft. Press them through a sieve sufficiently fine to reject the skins. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter or olive oil in a frying pan; add one or two medium-sized onions chopped fine; stir until the onion is slightly browned; add the chilli pulp and a half cup of the water in which the chicken was boiled; cover the pan closely; push it back where it will cook slowly fifteen minutes. Put into a bowl one quart of Southern corn meal; pour over sufficient water in which the chicken was boiled to make a dryish paste; work this with the hand until it becomes soft but not wet. Have ready the corn husks, which must be soaked and pliable. Put down the centre of a wide husk a strip of the corn meal paste; chop the cooked chicken, add the chilli mixture, put a layer down the centre of the corn meal in each husk; roll over the husks, fold in the ends and tie them with narrow strips of husks. The corn meal must entirely surround the chicken mixture. It is always wise to use wide husks to make sure that they are well wrapped. Put the bones back into the liquor in which the chicken was cooked, put the tamales over the top of the bones, taking care that they do not touch the water; sprinkle over a teaspoonful of salt, cover the boiler and cook continuously for one hour, being very careful that the water does not boil over the tamales. Serve hot.</p><p><emph rend="bold">MEXICAN TAMALES</emph> For these use either cooked beef or chicken.

Cook slowly a half hour. Put one quart of corn meal into a bowl, and add sufficient of the water in which the chicken was boiled to scald and just moisten; cover and let stand for thirty minutes. Now put a strip down the centre of your moistened corn husk; mix the chicken, chopped very fine, with tomato and chilli; put two tablespoonfuls down the centre on top of the corn meal, and on this put about twelve stoned raisins; roll over the husks so that the corn meal will entirely cover the chicken; turn up the ends, and tie them carefully. Put the bones of the chicken back into the water in which it was boiled; put the tamales over the top, and cook slowly for one and a half hours.

As a rule, these are made from uncooked sugar and white of egg, and while they may be palatable to some persons, to the connoisseur they are coarse and heavy. The excellency of the recipes consists in their simplicity and faithfulness to minutias.</p><p>12mo., with index; bound in cloth, 50 cents.</p><pb n="advertisement" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=841"/><p><emph rend="bold">New Salads</emph> For Dinners, Luncheons, Suppers and Receptions.

With many new and valuable recipes. By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book, etc.</p><p>We quote from the author's introduction: "Economical marketing does not mean the purchase of inferior articles at a cheap price, but of a small quantity of the best materials found in the market; these materials to be wisely and economically used. Small quantity and no waste, just enough and not a piece too much, is a good rule to remember. In roasts and steaks, however, there will be, in spite of careful buying, bits left over, that, if economically used, may be converted into palatable, sightly and wholesome dishes for the next day's lunch or supper."</p><p>Long 16mo., with index; bound in cloth, 50 cents.</p><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=842"/><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=843"/><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=844"/><pb n="back cover" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=rore&#38;PageNum=845"/></div>
