Many receipts are given for things, which being in daily use, the mode of preparing them may be supposed too well known to require a place in a cookery-book; yet how rarely do we meet with fine melted butter, good toast and water, or well-made coffee! She makes no apology for minuteness in some articles, or for leaving others unnoticed, because she does not write for professed cooks. This little work would have been a treasure to herself when she first set out in life, and she therefore hopes it may prove useful to others. In that expectation it is given to the Public; and as she will receive from it no emolument, so she trusts it will escape without censure.</emph></p></div>

<chapter><pb n="i" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=31"/><hd align="center" size="larger">MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS<lb/> FOR THE USE OF<lb/><emph rend="italic">THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.</emph></hd><p>IN every rank, those deserve the greatest praise, who best acquit themselves of the duties which their station requires. Indeed this line of conduct is not a matter of choice but of necessity, if we would maintain the dignity of our character as rational beings.</p><p>In the variety of female acquirements, though domestic occupations stand not so high in esteem as they formerly did, yet when neglected, they produce much human misery. There was a time when ladies knew nothing 
<emph rend="italic">beyond</emph> their own family concerns; but in the present day there are many who know nothing 
<emph rend="italic">about</emph> them. Each of these extremes should be avoided: but is there no way to unite in the female character, cultivation of talents and habits of usefulness ? Happily there are still great numbers in every situation, whose example proves that this is possible. Instances may be found of ladies in the higher -walks of life, who condescend to examine the accounts of their house-steward; and, by overlooking and wisely directing the expenditure of that part of their husband's income, which falls under their own inspection, avoid the inconveniences of embarrassed circumstances. How much more necessary, then, is domestic knowledge in<pb n="ii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=32"/> those whose limited fortunes press on their attention considerations of the strictest economy ! There ought to be a material difference in the degree of care which a per son of a large and independent estate bestows on money concerns, and that of a person in confined circumstances: yet both may very commendably employ some portion of their time and thoughts on this subject. The custom of the times tends in some measure to abolish the distinctions of rank; and the education given to young people, is nearly the same in all: but though the leisure of the higher may be well devoted to elegant accomplishments, the pursuits of those in a middle line, if less ornamental, would better secure their own happiness and that of others connected with them. We sometimes bring up children in a manner calculated rather to fit them for the station we wish, than that which it is likely they will actually possess; and it is in all cases worth the while of parents to consider whether the expectation or hope of raising their offspring above their own situation be well-founded.</p><p>The cultivation of the understanding and disposition, however, is not here alluded to; for a judicious improvement of both, united to firm and early taught religious principles, would enable the happy possessor of these advantages to act well on all occasions: nor would young ladies find domestic knowledge a burthen, or inconsistent with higher attainments, if the rudiments of it were inculcated at a tender age, when activity is so pleasing. If employment be tiresome to a healthy child, the fault must be traced to habits which, from many causes, are not at present favourable to the future conduct of women. It frequently happens, that before impressions<pb n="iii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=33"/> of duty are made on the mind, ornamental education commences; and it ever after takes the lead: thus, what should be only the embellishment, becomes the main business, of life. There is no opportunity of attaining a knowledge of family management at school; and during vacations, all subjects that might interfere with amusement are avoided.</p><p>When a girl, whose family moves in the higher ranks of life, returns to reside at her father's house after completing her education, her introduction to the gay world, and a continued course of pleasures, persuade her at once that she was born to be the ornament of fashionable circles, rather than to 
<emph rend="italic">stoop</emph> (as she would conceive it) to undertake the arrangement of a family, though by that means she might in various ways augment the satisfaction, and comfort of her parents. On the other hand, persons of an inferior sphere, and especially in the lower order of middling life, are almost always anxious to give their children such advantages of education as themselves did not possess. Whether their indulgence be productive of the happiness so kindly aimed at, must be judged by the effects, which are not very favourable, if what has been taught has not produced humility in herself, and increased gratitude and respect to the authors of her being. Were a young woman brought to relish home society, and the calm delights of agreeable occupation, before she entered into the delusive scenes of pleasure, presented by the theatre and other dissipations, it is-probable she would soon make a comparison much In favour of the former, especially if restraint did not give to the latter additional relish.</p><p>If we carry on our observations to married life, we shall<pb n="iv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=34"/> find a love of employment to be the source of unnumbered pleasures. To attend to the nursing, and at 
<emph rend="italic">least early</emph> instruction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the ways of piety and usefulness:-to preside over the family and regulate the income allotted to its maintenance: to make home the sweet refuge of a husband fatigued by intercourse with a jarring world: to be his enlightened companion and the chosen friend of his heart: these, these, are woman's duties! and delightful ones they are, if haply she be married to a man whose soul can duly estimate her worth, and who will bring his share to the common stock of felicity. Of such a woman, one may truly say, "Happy the man who can call her his wife, Blessed are the children who call her mother."</p><p>When we thus observe her, exercising her activity and best abilities in appropriate cares and increasing excellence, are we not ready to say, she is the agent for good of that benevolent Being, who placed her on earth to fulfil such sacred obligations, not to waste the talents committed to her charge.</p><p>When it is thus evident that the high intellectual attainments may find exercise in the multifarious occupations of the daughter, the wife, the mother, and the mistress of the house, can any one urge that the female mind is contracted by domestic employ? It is however a great comfort that the duties of life are within the reach of humbler abilities, and that 
<emph rend="italic">she</emph> whose chief-aim is to fulfil them, will rarely ever fail to acquit herself well. United with, and perhaps crowning all the virtues of the female character, is that well-directed ductility of mind, which occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the greater.</p><pb n="v" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=35"/><p>Hence the direction of a 
<emph rend="italic">table</emph> is no inconsiderable branch of a lady's concern:, as it involves judgment in expenditure; respectability of appearance; and the comfort of her husband and those who partake their hospitality.</p><p>The mode of covering the table differs in taste. It is not the multiplicity of things, but the choice, the dressing, and the neat pleasing look of the whole, which gives respectability to her who presides. Too much, or too little dinners are extremes not uncommon: the latter is in appearance and reality the effort of poverty or penuriousness to he 
<emph rend="italic">genteel;</emph> and the former, if constantly given, may endanger the circumstances of those who are not affluent.</p><emph rend="italic">Generally speaking, dinners are far less sumptuous than formerly, when half a dozen dishes were supplied for what one now costs; consequently those whose fortunes are not great, and who wish to make a genteel appearance, without extravagance, regulate their table accordingly.</emph><p>Perhaps there are few incidents in which the respectability of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to which he accidentally may bring home a visitor. Every one is to live as he can afford, and the meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the entertainments of the higher classes, but if two or three dishes are well served, with the usual sauces, the table-linen clean, the small sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, the expectation of the husband and friend will be gratified, because no irregularity of domestic arrangement will disturb the social intercourse. The same observation holds good on a larger scale. In<pb n="vi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=36"/> all situations of life, the entertainment should be no less suited to the station, than to the fortune of the 
<emph rend="italic">entertainer,</emph> and to the number and rank of those invited.</p><p>The manner of carving is not only a very necessary branch of information, to enable a lady to do the honours of her table, but makes a considerable difference in the consumption of a family: and though in large parties she is so much assisted as to render this knowledge apparently of less consequence, yet she must at times feel the deficiency; and should not fail to acquaint herself with an attainment, the advantage of which is evident every day.</p><p>Indeed, as fashions are so fleeting, it is more than probable, that before the end of this century, great attention to guests may be again the mode, as it was in the commencement of the last. Some people haggle meat so much, as not to be able to help half-a-dozen persons decently from a large tongue, or a sirloin of beef; and the dish goes away with the appearance of having been gnawed by dogs. If the daughters of the family were to take the head of the table under the direction of their mother, they would fulfill its duties with grace, in the same easy manner as an early practice in other domestic affairs gradually fits them for their own future houses. Habit alone can make good carvers; but some principal directions are hereafter given, with a reference to the annexed plates.</p><p>The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and consequently that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste may be avoided; and this attention is of more importance<pb n="vii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=37"/> now that the price of every necessary of life is increased to an enormous degree.</p><p>If a lady has never been accustomed, while single, to think of family management, let her not upon that account fear that she cannot attain it: she may consult others who are more experienced, and acquaint herself with the necessary quantities of the several articles of family expenditure; in proportion to the number it consists of, the proper prices to pay, &#38;c. &#38;c.</p><p>A minute account of the annual income, and the times of payment, should be taken in writing; likewise an estimate of the supposed amount of each article of expence; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles, will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment requires, as will give them the happy medium between prodigality and parsimony, without acquiring the character of meanness.</p><p>Perhaps few branches of female education are so useful, as great readiness at figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered; and if balanced every week and month, &#38;c. the income and outgoings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each other be duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be appropriated to each different article, and keep the money in separate purses; as house, clothes, pocket, education of children, &#38;c. Whichever way accounts be entered, a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly adhered to. Many women are unfortunately ignorant of the state of their husband's income; and others are only made acquainted with it, when some speculative project, or profitable transaction, leads them to make a false estimate<pb n="viii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=38"/> of what can be afforded; and it too often happens that both parties, far from consulting each other, squander money in ways that they would even wish to forget: whereas marriage should be a state of mutual and perfect confidence, and similarity of pursuits, which would secure that happiness it was intended to bestow.</p><p>There are so many valuable women who excel as wives, that it is a fair inference there would be few extravagant ones, were they consulted by their husbands on subjects that concern the mutual interest of both parties. Within the knowledge of the writer of these pages many families have been reduced to poverty by the want of openness in the man on the subject of his affairs; and though on these occasions the women were blamed, it has afterwards appeared, that they never were allowed a voice of enquiry, or suffered to reason upon what sometimes appeared to them imprudent.</p> 
<p>Many families have owed their prosperity full as much to the propriety of female management, as to the knowledge and activity of the father.</p><p>The lady of a general officer observed to her man-cook, that her last weekly bill was higher than usual. Some excuse was offered;--to which she replied:--"Such is the sum I have allotted to house-keeping: should it be exceeded one week, the next must repay it. The general will have no public day this week." The fault was never repeated.</p><p>March's "Family Book-keeper," is a very useful work, and saves much trouble; the various articles of expense being printed, with a column for every day in the year, so that at one view the amount of expenditure on each, and the total sum, may be known.</p><pb n="ix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=39"/><p>Ready-money should be paid for all such things as come not into weekly bills, and even for them a check is necessary. The best places for purchasing should be attended to. In some articles a discount of five per cent is allowed for ready money in London and other large cities, and those who thus pay are usually best served. Under the idea of buying cheap, many go to new shops, but it is safest to deal with people of established credit who do not dispose of goods by underselling.</p><p>To make tradesmen wait for their money injures them greatly, besides that a higher price must be paid, and in long bills, articles never bought are often charged. Perhaps the irregularity and failure of payment, may have much evil influence on the price of various articles, and may contribute to the destruction of many families from the highest to the lowest.</p><p>Thus regularly conducted, the exact state of money affairs will be known with ease; for it is delay of payment that occasions confusion. A common-place book should be always at hand, in which to enter such hints of useful knowledge, and other observations as are given by sensible experienced people. Want of attention to what is advised, or supposing things too minute to be worth hearing, are the causes why so much ignorance prevails on necessary subjects, among those who are, not backward in frivolous ones.</p><p>It is very necessary for a woman to be informed of the prices and goodness of all articles in common use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing them. She should also be acquainted with the 
<emph rend="italic">comparative</emph> prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to substitute<pb n="x" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=40"/> those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as well for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false notion of economy leads many to purchase as bargains, what is not wanted, and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money would remain for other purposes. It is not unusual among lower dealers to put off a larger quantity of goods, by assurances that they are advancing in price; and many who supply fancy articles are so successful in persuasion, that purchasers not unfrequently go far beyond their original intention, even to their own future disquiet. Some things are better for keeping, and, being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly; such a paper, soap, and candles. Of these more hereafter.</p> 
<p>To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted; for people ought to form their conduct on their circumstances, but it is presumed that a judicious arrangement according to them, will be found equally advantageous to all. The minutiae of management must be regulated by every one's fortune and rank; some ladies, not deficient in either, charge themselves with giving out, once in a month, to a superintending servant, such quantities of household articles, as by observation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key the large stock of things usually laid in for very large families in the country. Should there be several more visitors than usual, they can easily account for increase of consumption, and 
<emph rend="italic">vice versa.</emph> Such a degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eye of domestics, if they are not interested in the ignorance of their employers; and if they are, their services will not compensate for want of honesty.</p><pb n="xi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=41"/><p>When young ladies marry, they frequently continue their own maid in the capacity of house-keeper; who as they may be more attached to their interest than strangers, become very valuable servants. To such, the economical observations in this work will be as useful as the cookery; and it is recommendable in them to be strictly observant of both, which in the course of a year or two, will make them familiar in the practice.</p><p>It is much to be feared, that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account.</p><p>Some part of every person's fortune should be devoted to charity; by which "a pious woman will build up her house before God, while she that is foolish 
<emph rend="italic">(i. e.</emph> lends nothing to the Lord,) pulls it down with her hands." No one can complain of the want of gifts to the poor in this land:--but there is a mode of relief which would add greatly to their comfort, and which being prepared from superfluity, and such materials as are often thrown away, the expense would not be felt. In the latter part of this work some hints for preparing the above are given.</p><p>By good hours, especially early breakfast, a family is more regular, and much time is saved. If orders be given soon in the morning, there will be more time to execute them; and servants, by doing their work with ease, will be more equal to it, and fewer will be necessary.</p><p>It is worthy of notice that the general expense will be reduced, and much time saved, if every thing be<pb n="xiii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=42"/> kept in its proper place, applied to its proper use, and mended, when the nature of the accident will allow, as soon as broken.</p><p>If the economy of time was duly considered, the useful affairs transacted before amusements were allowed, and a regular plan of employment was daily laid down, a great deal might be done without hurry or fatigue; and it would be a most pleasant retrospect at the end of the year, were it possible to enumerate all the valuable acquirements made, and the good actions performed by an active woman.</p><p>If the subject of servants be thought ill-timed in a book upon family arrangement, it must be by those who do not recollect that the regularity, and good management of the heads will be insufficient, if not seconded by those who are to execute orders. It behoves every person to be extremely careful whom he takes into his service; to be very minute in investigating the character he receives, and equally cautious and scrupulously just in giving one to others. Were this attended to, many had people would be incapacitated for doing mischief, by abusing the trust reposed in them. It may be fairly asserted that the robbery or waste, which is but a milder epithet for the unfaithfulness of a servant, will be laid to the charge of that master or mistress, who knowing, or having well-founded suspicions of such faults, is prevailed upon by false pity, or entreaty, to slide him into another place. There are however some who are unfortunately capricious, and often refuse to give a character because they are displeased that a servant leaves their service: but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery, servants having no inheritance, and depending<pb n="xiii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=43"/> on their fair name for employment. To refuse countenance to the evil, and to encourage the good servant, are actions due to society at large; and such as are honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties, should be liberally rewarded, which would encourage merit, and inspire servants with zeal to acquit themselves.</p><p>It may be proper to observe that a retributive justice usually marks persons in that station sooner or later even in this world. The extravagant and idle in servitude, are ill prepared for the industry and sobriety on which their own future welfare so essentially depends. Their faults, and the attendant punishment come home when they have children of their own; and sometimes much sooner. They will see their own folly and wickedness perpetuated in their offspring, whom they must not expect to be better than the example and instruction given by themselves.</p><p>It was the observation of a sensible and experienced woman, that she could always read the fate of her servants who married; those who had been faithful and industrious in her service, continued their good habits in their own families, and became respectable members of the community:--those who were the contrary, never were successful, and not unfrequently were reduced to the parish.</p><p>A proper quantity of household articles should be always ready, and more bought in before the others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience, especially in the country.</p><p>A bill of parcels and receipt should be required, even if the money be paid at the time of purchase; and, to<pb n="xiv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=44"/> avoid mistakes, let the goods be compared with these when brought home.</p><p>Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one's honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been unintentional; yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugars, &#38;c. when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered.</p><p>Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is company, if servants are required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily.</p><p>All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness; sugars of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry, spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is necessary than when boiled whole in gravies, &#38;c.</p><p>Where noonings or suppers are served, (and in every house some preparation is necessary for accidental visitors) care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either, a list of several will be sub-joined, a change of which may be agreeable, and if duly managed will be attended with little expense and much convenience.</p><p>A ticket should be exchanged by the cook 
<emph rend="italic">for</emph> every loaf of bread, which when returned will shew the number to be paid for; as tallies may be altered, unless one is kept by each party.</p><p>Those who are served with brewer's beer; or any other articles not paid for weekly or on delivery should keep<pb n="xv" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=45"/> a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to prevent overcharges, but will shew the whole year's consumption at one view.</p><p>An inventory of furniture, linen, and China should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a year, or oftener, if there be a change of servants; into each of whose care the articles used by him or her, should be entrusted, with a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it belongs to, should be sewed on each feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths, are often deficient: these accidents might be obviated, if an article at the head of every list required the former should be produced whole or broken, and the marked part of the linen, though all the others should be worn out. The inducement to care of glass is in some measure removed, by the increased price given for old flint glass.--Those who wish for trifle dishes, butter-stands, &#38;c. at a lower charge than cut glass, may buy them made in moulds, of which there is great variety that look extremely well, if not placed near the more beautiful articles.</p><p>The price of starch depends upon that of flour; the best will keep good in a dry warm room for some years; therefore when bread is cheap it may be bought to advantage, and covered close.</p><p>SUGARS being an article of considerable expense in all families, the purchase demands particular attention. The cheapest does not go so far as that more refined; and there is difference even in the degree of sweetness. The white should be chosen that is close, heavy, and shining. The best sort of brown has a bright gravelly look,<pb n="xvi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=46"/> and it is often to be bought pure as imported. East India sugars are finer for the price, but not so strong, consequently unfit for wines and sweetmeats, but do well for common purposes, if good of their kind. To prepare white sugar, pounded, rolling it with a bottle, and sifting, wastes less than a mortar.</p><p>Candles made in cool weather are best; and when their price, and that of soap, which rise and fall together, is likely to be higher, it will be prudent to lay in the stock of both. This information the chandler can always give; they are better for keeping eight or ten months, and will not injure for two years, if properly placed in the cool; and there are few articles that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a due quantity of, according to the size of the family.</p><p>Paper, by keeping, improves in quality; and if bought by half or whole reams from large dealers, will be much cheaper than purchased by the quire. The surprising increase of the price of this article may be accounted for by the additional duties, and a larger consumption, besides the monopoly of rags; of the latter it is said there is some scarcity, which might be obviated if an order were given to a servant in every family to keep a bag to receive all the waste bits from cuttings out, &#38;c.</p><p>Many well-meaning servants are ignorant of the best means of managing, and thereby waste as much as would maintain a small family, besides causing the mistress of the house much chagrin by their irregularity; and many families, from a want of method, have the appearance of chance rather than of regular system. To avoid this, the following hints may be useful as well as economical:--</p><pb n="xvii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=47"/><p>Every article should be kept in that place best suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided, viz.</p><p>Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded.--Meat in a cold dry place.--Sugar and sweetmeats require a dry place; so does salt.-Candles cold, but not damp.--Dried meats, hams, &#38;c. the same.--All sorts of seeds for puddings, saloop, rice, &#38;c. should be close covered to preserve from insects; but that will not prevent it, if long kept.</p><p>Bread is now so heavy an article of expense that all waste should be guarded against; and having it cut in the room will tend much to prevent it. Since the scarcity in 1795 and 1800, that custom has been much adopted. It should not be cut until a day old. Earthen pans and covers keep it best.</p><p>Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry, to prevent a musty taste.</p><p>Large pears should be tied up by the stalk.</p> 
<p>Basil, savoury, or knotted marjoram, or London thyme, to be used when herbs are ordered; but with discretion, as they are very pungent.</p><p>The best means to preserve blankets from moths is to fold and lay them under the feather-beds that are in use; and they should be shaken occasionally. When soiled, they should be washed, not scoured.</p><p>Soda, by softening the water, saves a great deal of soap. It should be melted in a large jug of water, some of which pour into the tubs and boiler; and when the lather becomes weak, add more. The new improvement on soft soap is, if properly used, a saving of near half in quantity; and though something dearer than the hard reduces the price of washing considerably.</p><pb n="xviii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=48"/><p>Many good laundresses advise soaping linen in warm water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the operation with less friction.</p><p>Soap should be cut with a wire or twine, in pieces that will make a long square when first brought in, and kept out of the air two or three weeks; for if it dry quick, it will crack, and when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving a space between, and let it grow hard gradually. Thus, it will save a full third in the consumption.</p><p>Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first to preserve the peel dry; some should be halved, and when squeezed, the pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the first way is best. When these fruits are cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared as above directed, especially by those who live in the country, where they cannot always be had; and they are perpetually wanted in cookery.</p><p>When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to have pudding, custard, &#38;c. to employ the yolks also. Should you not want them for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It was a mistake of old, to think that the whites made cakes and puddings heavy; on the contrary, if beaten long and separately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, are an advantage to paste, and make a pretty dish beaten with fruit, to set in cream, &#38;c.</p><p>If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful not to let the tin be rubbed off; and to have them fresh done when the least defect appears, and never to put by any soup, gravy,<pb n="xix" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=49"/> &#38;c. in them, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen vessels should be provided for those purposes, as likewise plenty of common dishes, that the table set may be used to put by cold meat.</p><p>Tin vessels, if kept damp, soon rust, which causes holes. Fenders, and tin linings of flower-pots, &#38;c. should be painted every year or two.</p><p>Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed red ware, by which a strong poison is produced. Some years ago, the death of several gentlemen was occasioned at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to table, which she had kept from the preceding day in a copper vessel badly tinned.</p><p>Vinegar, by its acidity does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic.</p><p>To cool liquors in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the process once or twice.</p><p>The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a stone jar on a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a sauce-pan of water, called a water-bath.</p><p>If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &#38;c. be suffered to boil over, the strength is lost.</p><p>The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders: for the latter there is a new contrivance to sift, without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket.</p><p>Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cinders, lightly wet, give a great degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens.</p><pb n="xx" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=50"/><p>The cook should be charged to take care of jelly-bags, tapes for the collared things, &#38;c. which if not perfectly scalded, and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour when next used.</p><p>Cold water thrown on cast iron, when hot, will cause it to crack.</p><p>In the following and indeed all other receipts, though the quantities may be as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &#38;c. which can never be ordered by general rules; and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of her employers, not all the ingredients which nature and art can furnish, will give exquisite flavour to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand, and she must proportion them until the true 
<emph rend="italic">zest</emph> be obtained, and a variety of flavour be given to the different dishes served at the same time.</p><p>Those who require maigre dishes will find abundance in this little work; and where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed in stuffings, the cook must use butter instead; and where meat gravies, (or stock as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.</p>	
<hd align="center" size="larger">DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING.</hd><p>THE carving-knife for a lady should be light, and of a middling size and fine edge. Strength is less required than address, in the manner of using it; and to facilitate<pb n="xxi" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=51"/> this, the cook should give orders to the butcher to divide 
<emph rend="italic">the joints</emph> of the bones of all carcase-joints of mutton, lamb, and veal, (such as neck, breast and loin;) which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too thick, a small slice may he taken off between every two bones.</p><p>The more fleshy joints (as fillet of veal, leg or saddle of mutton, and beef) are to be helped in thin slices, neatly cut and smooth; observing to let the knife pass down to the bone in the mutton and beef joints.</p><p>The dish should not be too far off the carver; as it gives an awkward appearance, and makes the task more difficult. Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such articles as are considered the best.</p><p>In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes; which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and contribute much to the beauty of its appearance. A fish-knife, not being sharp, divides it best on this account. Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each person. The heads of carp, parts of those of cod and salmon, sounds of cod, and fins of turbot, are likewise esteemed niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly.</p> 
<p>In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, for a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will be more prime pieces.</p>

Their season is August.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Gudgeons.</emph>--They are chosen by the same rules as other <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> They are taken in running streams; come in about midsummer, and are to be had for five or six months.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Eels.</ingredient></emph>--There is a greater difference in the goodness of <ingredient>eels</ingredient> than of any other <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> The true silver-<ingredient>eel</ingredient> (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch <ingredient>eels</ingredient> sold at Billingsgate are very bad; those taken in great floods are generally<pb n="3" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=73"/> good, but in ponds they have usually a strong rank flavour.

The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready-boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring; otherwise that part will be flabby. The cock <ingredient>lobster</ingredient> is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and <ingredient>hard;</ingredient> but those of the <ingredient>hen</ingredient> are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the colour when boiled is a deeper red.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Crabs.</ingredient></emph>--The heaviest are best, and those of a middling size are sweetest. If light they are watery: when in perfection the joints of the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> are stiff, and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eyes look dead and loose when stale.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Prawns</ingredient> and Shrimps.</emph>--When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright,--Shrimps are of the <ingredient>prawn</ingredient> kind, and may be judged by the same rules.</p><p><emph rend="italic"><ingredient>Oysters.</ingredient></emph>--There are several kinds; the Pyfleet, Colchester, and Milford, are much the best. The native Milton are fine, being <ingredient>white</ingredient> and <ingredient>fat;</ingredient> but others may be made to possess both these qualities in some degree by proper feeding. When alive and strong the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as soon as opened, the flavour becoming poor otherwise.

<chapter><hd rend="italic" align="center" size="larger">PART II.</hd><hd align="center" size="larger">MEATS. </hd><hd rend="italic" align="center">To choose Meats.</hd><p><emph rend="italic">Venison.</emph>--If the fat be clear, bright, and thick, and the cleft part smooth and close, it is young; but if the cleft is wide and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweetness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few people like it when it has much of the 
<emph rend="italic">haut gout.</emph></p><p><emph rend="italic">Beef.</emph>--If the flesh of ox-beef is young, it will have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good red, and feel tender. The fat should look white rather than yellow; for when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good: beef fed by oil-cakes is in general so, and the flesh is flabby. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat whiter, than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not of so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is closer still, the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and a<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=94"/> stronger scent. Ox-beef is the reverse. Ox-beef is the richest and largest; but in small families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is better if finely fed. In old meat there is a streak of horn in the ribs of beef: the harder this is, the older; and the flesh is not finely flavoured.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Veal.</emph>--The flesh of a bull-calf is firmest, but not so white. The fillet of the cow-calf is generally preferred for the udder. The whitest is not the most juicy, having been made so by frequent bleeding and having had whiting to lick. Choose the meat of which the kidney is well covered with white thick fat. If the bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, it is newly killed; but any other colour shews it stale. The other parts should be dry and white; if clammy or spotled, the meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns first in the loin, and the suet will not then be firm.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Mutton.</emph>--Choose this by the fineness of its grain, good colour, and firm white fat. It is not the better for being young; if of a good breed and well fed, it is better for age: but this only holds with wether-mutton: the flesh of the ewe is paler, and the texture finer. Ram-mutton is very strong-flavoured, the flesh is of a deep red, and the fat is spongy.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Lamb.</emph>--Observe the neck of a fore-quarter: if the vein is bluish, it is fresh; if it has a green or yellow cast, it is stale. In the hindquarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes are sunk, the head is not fresh. Grass-lamb comes into season in April or May, and continues till August. House-lamb may be had in great towns almost all the year, but is in highest perfection in December and January.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Pork.</emph>--Pinch the lean, and if young it will break. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be impressed by the finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork. When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and cool; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called measly pork is very unwholesome; and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is never<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=95"/> the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the best.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Bacon.</emph>--If the rind is thin, the fat firm and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the bone, you may conclude it good, and not old. If there are yellow streaks in it, it is going, if not already rusty.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Hams.</emph>--Stick a sharp knife under the bone: if it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham is good; but if the knife is daubed and has a bad scent, do not buy it. Hams short in the hock are best, and long-legged pigs are not to be chosen for any preparation of pork.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Brawn.</emph>--The horny part of young brawn will feel moderately tender, and the flavour will be better; the rind of old will be hard.</p><hd rend="italic" align="center">Observations, on purchasing, keeping, and dressing Meat.</hd><p>In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; it cuts out with most advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably: and being cheaper, they ought to be bought in turn; for, when they are weighed with the prime pieces, it makes the price of these come lower.</p><p>In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps and edgebones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck always taints: therefore do not purchase these joints if bruised.</p><p>The shank-bones of mutton should be saved; and, after soaking and brushing, may be added to give richness to gravies or soups. They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons.</p><pb n="26" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=96"/><p>When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify.</p><p>Dripping will baste every thing as well as butter, except fowls and game; and for kitchen pies, nothing else should be used.</p><p>The fat off a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter pudding than suet.</p><p>Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched, should be soaked in cold water two or three hours before used, or more if they are much iced. Putting them into hot water, or to the fire, till thawed, makes it impossible for any heat to dress them properly afterwards.</p><p>In warm weather, meat should be examined well when it comes in; and if flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and then well washed. In the height of summer, it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be salted lie an hour in very cold water, nibbing well any part likely to have been fly-blown; then wipe it quite dry, and have salt ready, and rub it thoroughly in every part, throwing a handful over it besides. Turn it every day, and rub the pickle in, which will make it ready for the table in three or four days. If to be very much corned, wrap it in a well floured cloth, after rubbing it with salt. This last method will corn fresh beef fit for the table the day it comes on, but it must be be put into the pot when the water boils.</p><p>If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging two or three days before it is salted.</p><p>The water in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the poor, by adding to it vegetables, oat-meal, or peas.</p><p>Roast-beef bones, or shank-bones of ham, make for peas-soup; and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten, that the fat may be taken off.</p><p>In some families great loss is sustained by the spoiling of meat. The best way to keep what is to be eaten unsalted is, as before directed, to examine it well, wipe it every day, and put some pieces of charcoal over it. If meat is brought from a distance in warm weather, the butcher<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=97"/> should be ordered to cover it close, and bring it early in the morning; but even then, if it is kept on the road while he serves the customers, who live nearest to him, it will very likely be fly-blown. This happens often in the country.</p><p>Wash all meat before you dress it: if for boiling, the colour will be better for soaking; but if for roasting, dry it.</p> 
<p>Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white.</p> 
<p>Particular care must be taken that the pot is well skimmed the 
<emph rend="italic">moment</emph> it boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed over the meat. The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be.</p> 
<p>The boiler and utensils should be kept delicately clean.</p> 
<p>Put the meat into cold water, and flour it well first. Meat boiled quick will be hard; but care must be taken that in boiling slow it does not stop, or the meat will be underdone.</p><p>If the steam is kept in, the water will not lesson much; therefore when you wish it to boil away, take off the cover of the soup-pot.</p><p>Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat, except carrots or parsnips with boiled beef.</p><p>As to the length of time required for roasting and boiling, the size of the joint must direct; as also the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and in boiling, the regular though slow progress it makes; for if the cook, when told to hinder the copper from boiling quick, lets it slop from boiling up at all, the usual time will not be sufficient, and the meat will be under-done.</p><p>Weigh the meat; and allow for all solid joints, a quarter of an hour for every pound, and some minutes (from ten to twenty) over, according as the family like it done.</p><p>A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and a half, and others in proportion.</p><p>A tongue, if dry, takes four hours slow boiling, after soaking: a tongue out of pickle, from two hours and a half to three hours, or more if very large; it must be judged by feeling whether it is very tender.</p><pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=98"/><p>A leg of pork, or of lamb, takes the full allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound.</p><p>In roasting, beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three hours and three quarters.</p><p>A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork, two hours.</p><p>The meat should be put at a good distance from the fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part becomes hot, which will prevent its being scorched while yet raw. Meat should be much basted; and when nearly done, floured to make it look frothed.</p><p>Veal and mutton should have a little paper put over the fat to preserve it.

Don't use the sediment of gravies, &#38;c. that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong, boil a turnip with them, if for sauce; this will make them mild.</p><p>If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate.</p><p>A clear jelly of

If damp they will make cakes or puddings heavy. Before they are added, a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to them, which causes the thing that they we put to, to be lighter.</p><p>Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, and always strained.</p><p>Sugar should be rubbed to a powder on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn-sieve.</p><p>Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and with a little sugar beaten in a marble mortar to a paste, and then mixed with a little wine, or cream, so as to divide easily among the other ingredients.</p><p>After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake depends much on their being well incorporated.</p><p>Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less<pb n="232" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=308"/> butter and eggs for having yeast, and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, milk and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, and is less easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingredients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire.</p><p>The heat of the oven is of great importance for cakes, especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to prevent its being burnt, if not long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge into the very centre, draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the oven.</p><p>If the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I have with great success had fresh fuel quickly put in, and kept the cakes hot till the oven was fit to finish the soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those who are employed, ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occur from negligence when large cakes are to be baked.</p>

People who attend properly to the dairy will feed the cows particularly well two or three weeks before they calve, which makes the milk more abundant after. In gentlemen's dairies more attention is paid to the size and beauty of the cows than to their produce, which dairymen look most to.</p><p>For making cheese the cows should calve from Lady-Day to May, that the large quantity of milk may come into use about the same time; but in gentlemens' families one or two should calve in August or September for a supply in winter. In good pastures, the average produce of a dairy is about three gallons a day each cow, from Lady-Day to Michaelmas, and from thence to Christinas one gallon a day. Cows will be profitable milkers to fourteen or fifteen years of age, if of a proper breed.</p><p>When a calf is to be reared, it should be taken from the cow in a week at furthest, or it will cause great trouble in rearing, because it will be difficult to make it take milk in a pan. Take it from the cow in the morning, and keep it without food till the next morning; and then, being hungry, it will drink without difficulty. Skimmed milk and fresh whey, just as warm as new milk, should be given twice a day in such quantity as is required. If milk runs short, smooth gruel mixed with milk will do. At first, let the calf be out only by day, and feed it at night and morning.</p><p>When the family is absent, or there is not a great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes the opportunity to provide for the winter-store: she should have a book to keep an account, or get some one to write down for her the produce of every week, and set down what butter she pots. The weight the pot will hold should be marked on each in making at the pottery. In another part of the book should be stated the poultry reared in one leaf, and the weekly consumption in another part.</p><emph rend="italic" align="center" placement="heading">Observations respecting Cheese.</emph><p>This well-known article differs according to the pasture<pb n="261" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=335"/> in which the cows feed. Various modes of preparing may effect a great deal; and it will be bad or good of its kind, by being in unskilful hands or the contrary; but much will still depend on the former circumstance. The same land rarely makes very fine butter, and remarkably fine cheese; yet due care may give one pretty good, where the other excels in quality.</p><p>When one is not as fine as the other, attention and change of method may amend the inferior. There is usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of dairy people, to make them give up an old custom for one newly recommended. This calls for the eye of the superior. A gentleman has been at the expense of procuring cattle from every county noted for good cheese, and it is affirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester, North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts are so excellent, as not to discredit their names. As the cows are all on one estate, it should seem that the mode of making must be a principal cause of the difference in flavour; besides, there is much in the size and manner of keeping.</p><p>Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness only, but also in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentleman's family, should consider in which way it can be managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, cheeses of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and proportioning the thickness of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it.</p><p>A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family use will be very well produced by<pb n="262" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=336"/> two meals of skim, and one of new milk; or in good land, by the skim-milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter-use, but not to interfere with the cheese as above, which will not take much time.</p>

Fish dressed many ways. Turtle. Mock Turtle. Boiled Meats and Stewed. Tongue. Ham. Bacon. Chawls of Bacon Turkey and Fowls, chiefly boiled. Rump, Sirloin, and Ribs of Beef roasted. Leg, Saddle, and other roast Mutton. Roast Fillet, Loin, Neck, Breast, and Shoulder of Veal. Leg of Lamb. Loin. Fore-Quarter. Chine. Lamb's-head and Mince. Mutton stuffed and roasted. Steaks, variously prepared. Ragouts and Fricassees. Meat Pies raised, and in Dishes. Patties of Meat, Fish, and Fowl. Stewed Pigeons. Venison. Leg of Pork, Chine, Loin, Sparib. Rabbits. Hare. Puddings, boiled and baked. Vegetables, boiled and stewed. Calf's Head different ways. Pig's Feet and Ears different ways. In large dinners two Soups and two dishes of Fish.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Things for Second Course.</emph>--Birds: and Game of all sorts. Shell-fish, cold and potted. Collared and Potted Fish. Pickled ditto. Potted Birds. Ribs of Lamb roasted, Brawn. Vegetables, stewed or in sauce. French Beans. Peas. Asparagus. Cauliflower. Fricassee. Pickled Oysters. Spinach, aud Artichoke bottoms. Stewed Celery. Sea Cale. Fruit Tarts. Preserved-Fruit Tourts. Pippins stewed. Cheesecakes, various sorts. All the list of Sweet Dishes, of which abundance are given from 
<emph rend="italic">page 185 to 224,</emph> with directions for preparing them, such as creams, Jellies, and all the finer sorts of Puddings, Mince Pies, &#38;c. Omlet. Macaroni. Oysters in Scallops, stewed or pickled.</p><p>Having thus named the sort of things used for the two courses, the reader will think of many others. For removes of Soup and Fish one or two joints of Meat or Fowl are served; and for one small course, the articles suited to the second must make a part. Where Vegetables and Fowls, &#38;c. are twice dressed, they add to the appearance of the table the first time; three sweet things may form the second appearaace without greater expense.</p><pb n="322" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=396"/><p>The Bills of Fare which have been given from 
<emph rend="italic">page 309 to 320,</emph> may be modified at discretion.</p><p>In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in succession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &#38;c. Made Dishes and Game follow; and lastly Sweet Dishes: but these are not the common modes.</p><p>It is worthy observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in the house, unless ordered; though, by so doing, the addition of a collared or pickled thing, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made Dumplings, would be useful when there happen to be accidental visitors: and at all times it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vegetables are put on the side table at large dinners, as likewise sauces, and servants bring them round: but some inconveniences attend this plan; and, when there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned, besides that by aukwardness the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much.</p><hd align="center">SUPPERS.</hd><p>Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late. When required, the top and bottom, or either, may be Game. Fowls. Rabbit. Boiled Fish, such as Soles, Mackerel. Oysters stewed or scalloped. French Beans. Cauliilower, or Jerusalem Artichokes, in white Sauce. Brocoli with Eggs. Stewed Spinach and ditto. Sweetbreads. Small Birds. Mushrooms. Potatoes. Scallop, &#38;c. Cutlets. Roast Onions. Salmagundy. Buttered Eggs on Toast. Cold Neat's Tongue. Ham. Collared things. Hunter's Beef sliced. Rusks buttered, with Anchovies on. Grated Hung Beef with butter, with or without Rusks. Grated Cheese round, and Butter dressed in the middle of a plate. Radishes ditto. Custards<pb n="323" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=397"/> in glasses with Sippets. Oysters cold or pickled. Potted Meals. Fish. Birds. Cheese, &#38;c. Good plain Cake sliced. Pies of Bird, or Fruit. Crabs. Lobster Prawns. Cray-fish. Any of the list of sweet things. Fruits. A Sandwich set with any of the above articles, placed a little distance from each other on the table, looks well, without the tray, if preferred.</p><p>The lighter the things the better they appear, and glass intermixed has the best effect. Jellies, different coloured things, and flowers, add to the beauty of the table. An elegant supper may be served at a small expense by those who know how to make trifles that are in the house form the greatest part of the meal.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Note.</emph>--Any of the following things may be served as a relish, with the cheese, after dinner. Baked or pickled Fish done high. Dutch pickled Herring. Sardinias, which eat like Anchovy but are larger. Anchovies. Potted Char. Ditto Lampreys. Potted Birds made high. Caviare and Sippets of Toast. Salad. Radishes. French Pie. Cold Butter. Potted Cheese. Anchovy Toast, &#38;c. Before serving a Dutch Herring, it is usual to cut to the bones without dividing, at the distance of two inches from head to tail, before served.</p><pb n="blank" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=syst&#38;PageNum=398"/>
