<p>The difficulties I encountered when I first entered on the duties of a housekeeping life, from the want of books sufficiently clear and concise to impart knowledge to a Tyro, compelled me to study the subject, and by actual experiment to reduce every thing in the culinary line, to proper weights and measures. This method I found not only to diminish the necessary attention and labour, but to be also economical: for, when the ingredients employed were given in just proportions, the article made was always equally good. The government of a family, bears a Lilliputian resemblance to the government of a nation. The contents of the Treasury must be known, and great care taken to keep the expenditures from being equal to the receipts. A regular system must be introduced into each department, which may be modified until matured, and should then pass into an inviolable law. The grand arcanum of management lies in three simple rules:- &#34;Let every thing be done at a proper time, keep every thing to its proper use.&#34; If the mistress of a family, will every morning examine minutely the different departments of her house-, 
 
<pb n="x" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=14"/>
hold, she must detect errors in their infant state, when they can be corrected with ease; but a few days' growth gives them gigantic strength: and disorder, with all her attendant evils, are introduced. Early rising is also essential to the good government of a family. A late breakfast deranges the whole business of the day, and throws a portion of it on the next, which opens the door for confusion to enter. The greater part of the following receipts have been written from memory, where they were impressed by long continued practice. Should they prove serviceable to the young inexperienced housekeeper, it will add greatly to that gratification which an extensive circulation of the work will be likely to confer.</p>

<hd align="center" size="larger" rend="bold">INTRODUCTION.</hd>
<p>MANAGEMENT is an art that may be acquired by every woman of good sense and tolerable memory. If, unfortunately, she has been bred in a family where domestic business is the work of chance, she will have many difficulties to encounter; but a determined resolution to obtain this valuable knowledge, will enable her to surmount all obstacles. She must begin the day with an early breakfast, requiring each person to be in readiness to take their seats when the muffins, buckwheat cakes, &#38;c. are placed on the table. This looks social and comfortable. When the family breakfast by detachments, the table remains a tedious time; the servants are kept from their morning's meal, and a complete derangement takes place in the whole business of the day. No work can be done till breakfast is finished. The Virginia ladies, who are proverbially good managers, employ themselves, while their servants are eating, in washing the cups, glasses, &#38;c.; arranging the cruets, the mustard, salt-sellers, pickle vases, and all the apparatus for the dinner table. This occupies but a short time, and the lady has the satisfaction of knowing that they are in much better order than they would be if left to the servants. It also relieves her from the trouble of seeing the dinner table prepared, which should be done every day with the same scrupulous regard to exact neatness and method, as if a grand company was expected. When the servant is required to do this daily, he soon gets into the habit of doing it well; and his mistress having made arrangements for him in the morning, there is no fear of bustle and confusion in running after things that may be called for during the hour of dinner. When the kitchen breakfast is over, and the cook has put all things in their proper places, the mistress should go in to give her orders. Let all the articles intended for the dinner, pass in review before her: have the butter, sugar, flour, meal, lard, given out in proper quantities; the catsup, spice, wine, whatever may be wanted 
 
<pb n="xii" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=16"/>
for each dish, measured to the cook. The mistress must tax her own memory with all this: we have no right to expect slaves or hired servants to be more attentive to our interest than we ourselves are: they will never recollect these little articles until they are going to use them; the mistress must then be called out, and thus have the horrible drudgery of keeping house all day, when one hour devoted to it in the morning, would release her from trouble until the next day. There is economy as well as comfort in a regular mode of doing business. When the mistress gives out every thing, there is no waste; but if temptation be thrown in the way of subordinates, not many will have power to resist it; besides, it is an immoral act to place them in a situation which we pray to be exempt from ourselves.</p>
<p>The prosperity and happiness of a family depend greatly on the order and regularity established in it. The husband, who can ask a friend to partake of his dinner in full confidence of finding his wife unruffled by the pretty vexations attendant on the neglect of household duties- who can usher his guest into the dining-room assured of seeing that methodical nicety which is the essence of true elegance,- will feel pride and exultation in the possession of a companion, who gives to his home charms that gratify every wish of his soul, and render the haunts of dissipation hateful to him. The sons bred in such a family will be moral men, of steady habits; and the daughters, if the mother shall have performed the duties of a parent in the superintendence of their education, as faithfully as she has done those of a wife, will each be a treasure to her husband; and being formed on the model of an exemplary mother, will use the same means for securing the happiness of her own family, which she has seen successfully practised under the paternal roof.</p>

<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" size="larger" placement="heading">DIRECTIONS FOR CURING BEEF.</purpose>
PREPARE your <ingredient>brine</ingredient> in the middle of October, after the following manner: get a thirty gallon <implement>cask,</implement> take out one <ingredient>head,</ingredient> drive in the bung, and put some pitch on it, to prevent leaking. See that the <implement>cask</implement> is quite tight and clean. Put into it one pound of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> 
 
<pb n="23" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=27"/>
powdered, fifteen quarts of <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and fifteen gallons of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> stir it frequently, until dissolved, throw over the <implement>cask</implement> a thick cloth, to keep out the dust; look at it often and take off the scum. These proportions have been accurately ascertained- fifteen gallons of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> will exactly hold, in solution, fifteen quarts of good clean Liverpool <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and one pound of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient>: this <ingredient>brine</ingredient> will be strong enough to bear up an egg: if more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> be added, it will fall to the bottom without strengthening the <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> the <ingredient>water</ingredient> being already saturated. This <ingredient>brine</ingredient> will cure all the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> which a private family can use in the course of the winter, and requires nothing more to be done to it except occasionally skimming the dross that rises. It must be kept in a cool, dry place. For salting your <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> get a <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> hogshead and saw it in two, that the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> may have space to lie on; bore some holes in the bottom of these tubs, and raise them on one side about an inch, that the bloody <ingredient>brine</ingredient> may run off.</p>
<p>Be sure that your <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is newly killer- rub each piece very well with good <ingredient>Liverpool salt</ingredient>- a vast deal depends upon rubbing the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> into every part- it is unnecessary to put <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> on it; sprinkle a good deal of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on the bottom of the tub. When the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is well salted, lay it in the tub, and be sure you put the fleshy side downward. Put a great deal of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on your <ingredient>beef</ingredient> after it is packed in the tub; this protects it from animals who might eat, if they could smell it, and does not waste the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> for the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> can only dissolve a certain portion. You must let the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> lie in <ingredient>salt</ingredient> ten days, then take it out, brush off the <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and wipe it with a damp cloth; put it in the <ingredient>brine</ingredient> with a bit of board and weight to keep it under.</p>
 
<pb n="24" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=28"/>
<p>In about ten days it will look red and be fit for the table, but it will be red much sooner when the <ingredient>brine</ingredient> becomes older. The best time to begin to <ingredient>salt beef</ingredient> is the latter end of October, if the weather be cool, and from that time have it in succession. When your <ingredient>beef</ingredient> is taken out of the tub, stir the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> about to dry, that it may be ready for the next pieces. Tongues are cured in the same manner.</p>
</recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" size="larger" placement="heading">TO DRY BEEF FOR SUMMER USE.</purpose>
THE best pieces for this purpose are the thin briskets, or that part of the plate which is farthest from the shoulder of the animal, the round and rib pieces which are commonly used for roasting. These should not be cut with long ribs and the back-bones must be sawed off as close as possible, that the piece may lay flat in the dish. About the middle of February, select your <ingredient>beef</ingredient> from an animal well fatted with corn, and which, when killed, will weigh one hundred and fifty per quarter- larger oxen are always coarse. <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> the pieces as directed, let them lie one fortnight, then put them in <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> where they must remain three weeks: take them out at the end of the time, wipe them quite dry, rub them over with <ingredient>bran,</ingredient> and hang them in a cool, dry, and, if possible, dark place, that the flies may not get to them: they must be suspended, and not allowed to touch any thing. It will be necessary, in the course of the summer, to look them over occasionally, and after a long wet season, to lay them in the sun a few hours. Your tongues may be dried in the same manner. Make a little hole in the root, run a twine through it, and suspend it. These <ingredient>dried meats</ingredient> must be put in a good quantity of water, to 
 
<pb n="25" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=29"/>
soak, the night before they are to be used. In boiling, it is absolutely necessary to have a large quantity of <ingredient>water</ingredient> to put the <ingredient>beef</ingredient> in while the water is cold, to boil steadily, skimming the pot, until the bones are ready to fall out; and, if a tongue, till the skin peels off with perfect ease: the skin must also be taken from the <ingredient>beef.</ingredient> The housekeeper who will buy good ox beef, and follow these directions exactly, may be assured of always having delicious <ingredient>beef</ingredient> on her table. Ancient prejudice has established a notion, that <ingredient>meat</ingredient> killed in the decrease of the moon, will draw up when cooked. The true cause of this shrinking, may be found in the old age of the animal, or in its diseased state, at the time of killing. The best age is from three to five years.</p>
<p>Few persons are aware of the injury they sustain, by eating the flesh of diseased animals. None but the Jewish butchers, who are paid exclusively for it, attend to this important circumstance. The best rule for judging that I have been able to discover, is the colour of the fat. When the fat of beef is a high shade of yellow, I reject it. If the fat of veal, mutton, lamb or pork, have the slightest tinge of yellow. I avoid it as diseased. The same rule holds good when applied to poultry.</p>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame">
<p><purpose align="center" rend="bold" size="larger" placement="heading">IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ON ROASTING, BOILING, FRYING, &#38;C.</purpose>
IN roasting butcher's <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> be careful not to run the spit through the nice parts: let the piece lie in <ingredient>water</ingredient> one hour, then wash it out, wipe it perfectly dry, and put it on the spit. Set it before a clear, steady fire: sprinkle some <ingredient>salt</ingredient> on it, and when it becomes hot, baste it for a time with <ingredient>salt and water</ingredient>: then put a good spoonful of nice <ingredient>lard</ingredient> into the <implement>dripping-pan,</implement> and when melted, continue to baste with it. When your <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> of whatever kind, has been down some time, but before it begins to look brown, cover it with <ingredient>paper</ingredient> and baste on it; when it is nearly done, take off the peper, dredge it with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> turn the spit for some minutes very quick, and baste all the time to raise a froth- after which, serve it up. When <ingredient>mutton</ingredient> is roasted, after you take off the paper, loosen the skin and peel it off carefully, then dredge and froth it up. Beef and mutton must not be roasted as much as veal, lamb, or pork; the two last must be skinned in the manner directed for mutton. You may pour a little melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> in the dish with <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> but all the others must be served without sauce, and garnished with <ingredient>horse-radish,</ingredient> nicely scraped. Be careful not to let a 
 
<pb n="27" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=31"/>
particle of dry <ingredient>flour</ingredient> be seen on the meat- it has a very ill appearance. Beef may look brown, but the whiter the other meats are, the more genteel are they, and if properly roasted, they may be perfectly done, and quite white. A <ingredient>loin of veal,</ingredient> and hind quarter of <ingredient>lamb,</ingredient> should be dished with the <ingredient>kidneys</ingredient> uppermost; and be sure to joint every thing that is to be separated at table, or it will be impossible to carve neatly. For those who <emph rend="italic">must</emph> have gravy with these meats, let it be made in any way they like, and served in a boat. No <ingredient>meat</ingredient> can be well roasted except on a spit turned by a <implement>jack,</implement> and before a steady clear fire- other methods are no better than baking. Many cooks are in the habit of half boiling the meats to plump them as they turn it, before they are spitted, but it destroys their fine flavour. Whatever is to be boiled, must be put into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> with a little <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> which will cook them regularly. When they are put in <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> the outer side is done too much, before the inside gets heated. Nice <ingredient>lard</ingredient> is much better than <ingredient>butter</ingredient> for basting roasted <ingredient>meats,</ingredient> or for frying. To choose butchers' meat, you must see that the fat is not yellow, and that the lean parts are of a fine close grain, a lively colour, and will feel tender when pinched. Poultry should be well covered with white fat; if the bottom of the breast bone be gristly, it is young, but if it be a hard bone, it is an old one. <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> are judged by the liveliness of their eyes, and bright red of their gills. Dredge every thing with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before it is put on to boil, and be sure to add <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to the <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p>
<p><ingredient>Fish,</ingredient> and all other articles for frying, after being nicely prepared, should be laid on a board and dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> or meal mixed with <ingredient>salt</ingredient>: when it becomes 
 
<pb n="28" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=32"/>
dry on one side, turn it, and dredge the other. For broiling, have very clear <ingredient>coals,</ingredient> sprinkle a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> over the pieces, and when done, dish them, and pour over some melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and chopped <ingredient>parsley</ingredient>- this is for <ingredient>broiled veal,</ingredient> <ingredient>wild fowl,</ingredient> birds or poultry: <ingredient>beef-steaks</ingredient> and <ingredient>mutton</ingredient> chops require only a table-spoonful of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> to be poured over. <implement>Slice</implement> an <ingredient>onion</ingredient> in the dish before you put in the steaks or chops, and garnish both with rasped <ingredient>horse-radish.</ingredient> To have viands served in perfection, the dishes should be made hot, either by setting them over <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> or by putting some in them, and the instant the <ingredient>meats</ingredient> are laid in and garnished, put on a <implement>pewter dish</implement> cover. A dinner looks very enticing, when the steam rises from each dish on removing the covers, and if it be judiciously <emph rend="italic">ordered</emph>, will have a double relish. Profusion is not elegance- a dinner justly calculated for the company, and consisting for the greater part of small articles, correctly prepared, and neatly served up, will make a much more pleasing appearance to the sight, and give a far greater gratification to the appetite, than a table loaded with food, and from the multiplicity of dishes, unavoidably neglected in the preparation, and served up cold.</p>
<p>There should always be a supply of brown <ingredient>flour</ingredient> kept in readiness to thicken brown gravies, which must be prepared in the following manner: put a pint of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in a <implement>Dutch oven,</implement> with some <ingredient>coals</ingredient> under it; keep constantly stirring it until it is uniformly of a dark brown, but none of it burnt, which would look like dirt in the <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient> All kitchens should be provided with a saw for trimming <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> and also with <implement>larding needles.</implement></p>

<ingredient>HOGS</ingredient> are in the highest perfection, from two and a half to four years old, and make the best <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> when

they do not weigh more than one hundred and fifty or sixty at farthest; they should be fed with <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> six weeks at least, before they are killed, and the shorter distance they are driven to market, the better will their flesh be. To secure them against the possibility of spoiling, <ingredient>salt</ingredient> them before they get cold; take out the chine or back-bone from the neck to the tail, cut the hams, shoulders and middlings; take the ribs from the shoulders and the leaf fat from the hams: have such tubs as are directed for beef, rub a large table spoonful of <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> on the inside of each <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> for some minutes, then rub both sides well with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> sprinkle the bottom of the tub with <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> lay the <ingredient>hams</ingredient> with the skin downward, and put a good deal of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> between each layer; <ingredient>salt</ingredient> the shoulders and middlings in the same manner, but less <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> is necessary; cut the jowl or chop from the head, and rub it with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>saltpetre.</ingredient> You should cut off the <ingredient>feet</ingredient> just above the knee joint; take off the ears and nose, and lay them in a large tub of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for souse. When the jowls have been in <ingredient>salt</ingredient> two weeks, hang them up to smoke--do so with the shoulders and middlings at the end of three weeks, and the <ingredient>hams</ingredient> at the end of four. If they remain longer in <ingredient>salt</ingredient> they will be <ingredient>hard.</ingredient> Remember to hang the <ingredient>hams</ingredient> and shoulders with the hocks down, to <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> the <ingredient>juices.</ingredient> Make a good smoke every morning, and be careful not to have a blaze; the smoke-house should stand alone, for any additional heat will spoil the <ingredient>meat.</ingredient> During the hot weather, beginning the first of April, it should be occasionally taken down, examined--rubbed with <ingredient>hickory ashes,</ingredient> and hung up again.</p>
 
<pb n="50" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=54"/>
<p>The generally received opinion that <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> hardens <ingredient>meat,</ingredient> is entirely erroneous:--it tends greatly to prevent putrefaction, but will not make it hard; neither will laying in <ingredient>brine</ingredient> five or six weeks in cold weather, have that effect, but remaining in <ingredient>salt</ingredient> too long, will certainly draw off the juices, and harden it. <ingredient>Bacon</ingredient> should be boiled in a large quantity of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and a <ingredient>ham</ingredient> is not done sufficiently, till the bone on the under part comes off with case. New <ingredient>bacon</ingredient> requires much longer boiling than that which is old.</p>

Do not put too much in the pot, for it will boil to pieces and spoil the appearance. The best way is to boil the feet in one pot, the ears and nose in another, and the heads in a third; these should be boiled till you can take all the bones out; let them get cold, season the insides with <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and a little <ingredient>nutmeg;</ingredient> make it in a tight roll, sew it up close in a cloth, and <implement>press</implement> it lightly.

THE best method for preserving <ingredient>herrings,</ingredient> and which may be followed with ease, for a small family, is to take the <ingredient>brine</ingredient> left of your winter stock for <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> to the fishing place, and when the seine is hauled, to pick out the largest <ingredient>herrings,</ingredient> and throw them alive into the <ingredient>brine;</ingredient> let them remain twenty-four hours, take them out and lay them on sloping planks, that the <ingredient>brine</ingredient> may drain off; have a tight barrel, put some coarse <ingredient>alum salt</ingredient> at the bottom, then put in a layer of <ingredient>herrings</ingredient>--take care not to bruise them; sprinkle over it <ingredient>alum salt</ingredient> and some <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> then <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and <ingredient>saltpetre,</ingredient> till the barrel is full; keep a board over it. Should they not make <ingredient>brine</ingredient> enough to cover them in a few weeks, you must add some, for they will be rusty if not kept under <ingredient>brine.</ingredient> The proper time to <ingredient>salt</ingredient> them is when they are quite fat: the scales will adhere closely to a lean <ingredient>herring,</ingredient> but will be loose on a fat one--the former is not fit to be eaten. Do not be sparing of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> when you put them up. When they are to be used, take a few out of <ingredient>brine,</ingredient> soak them an hour or two, scale them nicely, pull off the gills, and the only entrail they have will come with them; wash them clean and hang them up to dry. When to be broiled, take half a sheet of <ingredient>white paper,</ingredient> rub it over with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> put the <ingredient>herring</ingredient> in, double the edges securely, and broil without burning it. The <ingredient>brine</ingredient> the <ingredient>herrings</ingredient> drink before they die, has a wonderful effect in preserving their juices: when one or two years old, they are equal to <ingredient>anchovies.</ingredient></p>

<hd align="center" rend="bold" size="larger" placement="heading">OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND CAKES.</hd>
<p>THE salt should always be washed from butter, when it is to be used in any thing that has sugar for an ingredient, and also from that which is melted to grease any kind of mould for baking--otherwise, there will be a disagreeable salt taste on the outer side of the article baked. Raisins should be stoned and cut in two, and have some flour sifted over them--stir them gently in the flour, and take them out free from lumps; the small quantity that adheres to them, will 
 
<pb n="114" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=118"/>
prevent their sticking together, or falling in a mass to the bottom. Eggs must be fresh, or they will not beat well: it is better to separate the yelks from the whites always, though it is a more troublesome process; but for some things it is essential to do so: when they are to be mixed with milk, let it cool after boiling, or the eggs will poach; and only set it on the fire a few minutes, to take off the raw taste of the eggs, stirring it all the time. Currants require washing in many waters to cleanse them; they must be picked and well dried, or they will stick together. Almonds should be put in hot water till the skins will slip off, which is called blanching; they must always be pounded with rose or orange flower water, to prevent their oiling. When cream is used, put it in just before the mixture is ready; much beating will decompose it. Before a pudding or cake is begun, every ingredient necessary for it must be ready; when the process is retarded by neglecting to have them prepared, the article is injured. The oven must be in a proper state, and the paste in the dishes or moulds, ready for such things as require it. Promptitude is necessary in all our actions, but never more so than when engaged in making cakes and puddings. When only one or two eggs are to be used, cooks generally think it needless to beat them--it is an error: eggs injure every thing, unless they are made light before they are used. Cloths for boiling puddings should be made of German sheeting: an article less thick, will admit the water, and injure the pudding.</p>

IT is the practice with some indolent cooks, to set the freezer containing the <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> in a tub with <ingredient>ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> and put it in the ice house; it will certainly freeze there; but not until the watery particles have subsided, and by the separation destroyed the <ingredient>cream.</ingredient> A freezer should be twelve or fourteen inches deep, and eight or ten wide. This facilitates the operation very much, by giving a larger surface for the ice to form, which it always does on the sides of the vessel; a silver spoon with a long handle should be provided for scraping the ice from the sides as soon as formed; 
 
<pb n="143" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=virg&#38;PageNum=147"/>
and when the whole is congealed, pack it in moulds (which must be placed with care, lest they should not be upright,) in <ingredient>ice</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> till sufficiently hard to retain the shape--they should not be turned out till the moment they are to be served. The freezing tub must be wide enough to leave a margin of four or five inches all around the freezer, when placed in the middle--which must be filled up with small lumps of ice mixed with <ingredient>salt</ingredient>--a larger tub would waste the ice. The freezer must be kept constantly in motion during the process, and ought to be made of pewter, which is less liable than tin to be worn in holes, and spoil the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> by admitting the <ingredient>salt water.</ingredient></p>

THE <implement>preserving pan</implement> should be made of bell metal, flat at the bottom, very large in diameter, but not deep.

There should also be a large <implement>chafing-dish</implement> with long legs, for the convenience of moving it to any part of the room. The process is a tedious one; and if the superintendent be not comfortably situated, the <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> cannot be properly managed. A ladle the size of a saucer, pieced and having a long handle, will be necessary for taking up the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> without <ingredient>syrup.</ingredient> When a <implement>chafing-dish</implement> cannot be procured, the best substitute is a brick stove, with a grating, to burn <ingredient>charcoal.</ingredient> The <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> should be the best double refined; but if the pure <ingredient>amber</ingredient> coloured <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> house <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> from the West Indies can be got, it is greatly superior; it never ferments, and the trouble is very much lessened by having ready made <ingredient>syrup,</ingredient>

in which it is only necessary to boil the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> till clear. All delicate <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be done gently, and not allowed to remain more than half an hour after it begins to stew, before it is laid on dishes to cool; it must be put into the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> again for the same time; continue this until it is sufficiently transparent. The advantage of this method is that the <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> are less liable to boil to pieces, than when done all at one time. It is injudicious to put more in the pan at once, than can lie on the bottom without crowding. The pan must be made bright, and nothing permitted to cool in it, lest it should canker. Delicate <ingredient>preserves</ingredient> should be kept in small glasses or pots, that will not hold more than one or two pounds, for the admission of air injures them; put letter <ingredient>paper</ingredient> wet with <ingredient>brandy</ingredient> on the <ingredient>preserves,</ingredient> and cover the tops with many folds of soft <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> that will tie round closely; keep them in a dry place, and expose them constantly to the sun to check fermentation. <ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> for preserving should be in full perfection, but not too ripe.</p>
