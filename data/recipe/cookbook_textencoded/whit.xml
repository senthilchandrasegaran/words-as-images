During forty years of practical housekeeping, it has been my custom, after <emph rend="italic">trying</emph> and <emph rend="italic">testing</emph> a recipe, and finding it <emph rend="italic">invariably</emph> a success, and also one of the <emph rend="italic">best</emph> of its kind, to copy it in a book, thereby accumulating a considerable amount of reliable and useful information in the culinary line.</p><p>As a convenient form of reference, this book embodies several original and commendable features, among which may be mentioned its plain print, its simplified method of explanation in preparing an article, in the order of manipulation, thereby enabling the most inexperienced to clearly comprehend it. Unlike most books, the leaves are broad, and when opened it will not close of itself, which obviates the necessity of frequently opening, as is the case with narrow pages.</p><p>The subject of carving has been given a prominent place, not only because of its special importance in a work of this kind, but particularly because it contains entirely new and original designs, and is so far a departure from the usual mode of treating the subject.</p><p>Hoping this book may be acceptable and of service to all housekeepers posessing a copy,</p><p align="right">I am faithfully yours,<lb/>MRS. F. L. GILLETTE.</p>NEW YORK CITY, December 15, 1886.</div>

<section><hd align="center">CARVING.</hd><p>Carving is one important acquisition in the routine of daily living, and all should try to attain a knowledge or ability to do it well, and withal gracefully.</p><p>When carving use a chair slightly higher than the ordinary size, as it gives a better purchase on the meat, and appears more graceful than when standing, as is often quite necessary when carving a turkey, or a very large joint. More depends on skill than strength. The platter should be placed opposite, and sufficiently near to give perfect command of the article to be carved, the knife of medium size, sharp with a keen edge. Commence by cutting the slices thin, laying them carefully to one side of the platter, then afterwards placing the desired amount on each guest's plate, to be served in turn by the servant.</p><p>In carving fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes; for if these are broken the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver should acquaint himself with the choicest parts and morsels; and to give each guest an equal share of those <emph rend="italic">tidbits</emph> should be his maxim. Steel knives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart a <emph rend="italic">very</emph> disagreeable flavor. A <implement>fish-trowel</implement> of silver or plated silver is the proper article to use.</p><p>Gravies should be sent to the table very <emph rend="italic">hot,</emph> and in helping one to gravy or melted butter, place it on a vacant side of the plate; not <emph rend="italic">pour</emph> it over their meat, fish or fowl, that they may use only as much as they like.</p><p>When serving fowls, or meat, accompanied with stuffing, the guests should be asked if they would have a portion, as it is not every one to whom the flavor of stuffing is agreeable; in filling their plates, avoid heaping one thing upon another, as it makes a bad appearance.</p><p>A word about the care of <implement>carving knives</implement>: a fine steel knife should not come in contact with intense heat, because it destroys its temper, and therefore impairs its cutting qualities. Table <implement>carving knives</implement> should not be used in the kitchen, either around the stove, or for cutting bread, meats, vegetables, etc.; a fine whetstone should be kept for sharpening, and the knife cleaned carefully to avoid dulling its edge, all of which is quite essential to successful carving.</p></section>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>
<purpose rend="bold" align="center" placement="heading">SIRLOIN OF BEEF.</purpose>
This choice roasting-piece should be cut with one good firm stroke from end to end of the joint, at the upper part, in thin, long, even slices in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, cutting across the grain, serving each guest with some of the fat with the lean; this may be done by cutting a small thin slice from underneath the bone from 5 to 6, through the <ingredient>tenderloin.</ingredient></p><p>Another way of carving this piece, and which will be of great assistance in doing it well, is to insert the knife just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along, dividing the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from the bone at the bottom and end, thus leaving it perfectly flat; then carve in long, thin slices the usual way. When the bone has been removed and the <ingredient>sirloin</ingredient> rolled before it is cooked, it is laid upon the platter on one end, and an even, thin <implement>slice</implement> is carved across the grain of the upper surface.</p><p><ingredient>Roast ribs</ingredient> should be carved in thin, even slices from the thick end towards the thin in the same manner as the <ingredient>sirloin;</ingredient> this can be more easily and cleanly done if the <implement>carving knife</implement> is first run along between the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and the end and <ingredient>rib-bones,</ingredient> thus leaving it free from bone to be cut into slices.</p><p><ingredient>Tongue.</ingredient>--To carve this, it should be cut crosswise, the middle being the best; cut in very <emph rend="italic">thin</emph> slices, thereby improving its delicacy, making it more tempting; as is the case of all well-carved <ingredient>meats.</ingredient> The root of the <ingredient>tongue</ingredient> is usually left on the platter.</p></recipe>

This piece is quite similar to a fore-quarter of <ingredient>lamb</ingredient> after the shoulder has been taken off. A <ingredient>breast of veal</ingredient> consists of two parts, the <ingredient>rib-bones</ingredient> and the gristly brisket. These parts may be separated by sharply passing the <implement>carving knife</implement> in the direction of the line from 1 to 2; and when they are entirely divided, the <ingredient>rib bones</ingredient> should be carved in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and the brisket can be helped by cutting slices from 3 to 4.</p><p>The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or <ingredient>ribs;</ingredient> and if there be a <ingredient>sweetbread</ingredient> served with the dish, as is frequently with this roast of <ingredient>veal,</ingredient> each person should receive a piece.</p><p>Though <ingredient>veal</ingredient> and <ingredient>lamb</ingredient> contain less nutrition than <ingredient>beef</ingredient> and <ingredient>mutton,</ingredient> in proportion to their weight, they are often preferred to these latter <ingredient>meats</ingredient> on account of their delicacy of texture and flavor.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>
<purpose rend="bold" align="center">NECK OF VEAL.</purpose>
The best end of a <ingredient>neck of veal</ingredient> makes a very good roasting-piece; it however is composed of bone and <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> that make it quite difficult to carve, unless it is done properly. To attempt to carve each chop and serve it, you would not only place too large a piece upon the plate of the person you intend to serve; but you would waste much time, and should the vertebrae have not been removed by the butcher, you would be compelled to exercise such a degree of strength that would make one's appearance very ungraceful, and possibly, too, throwing <ingredient>gravy</ingredient> over your neighbor sitting next to you. The correct way to carve this roast is to cut diagonally from figure 1 to 2, and help in slices of moderate thickness; then it may be cut from 3 to 4, in order to separate the small <ingredient>bones;</ingredient> divide and serve them, having first inquired if they are desired.</p><p>This joint is usually sent to the table accompanied by <ingredient>bacon,</ingredient> <ingredient>ham,</ingredient> <ingredient>tongue,</ingredient> or pickled <ingredient>pork</ingredient> on a separate dish and with a cut <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> on a plate.

The shoulder may be placed upon a separate dish for convenience. The next process is to divide the <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> from the brisket by cutting through the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> in the line from 1 to 2; then the <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> may be carved in the direction of the line 6 to 7, and the brisket from 8 to 9.

A <ingredient>turkey</ingredient> having been relieved from strings and <implement>skewers</implement> used in trussing should be placed on the table with the <ingredient>head</ingredient> or <ingredient>neck</ingredient> at the carver's right hand. An expert carver places the fork in the <ingredient>turkey,</ingredient> and does not remove it until the whole is divided. First insert the fork firmly in the lower part of the <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> just forward of fig. 2, then sever the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and <ingredient>wings</ingredient> on both sides, if the whole is to be carved, cutting neatly through the joint next to the body, letting these parts lie on the platter. Next, cut downward from the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> from 2 to 3, as many even slices of the <ingredient>white meat</ingredient> as may be desired, placing the pieces neatly on one side of the platter. Now unjoint the <ingredient>legs</ingredient> and <ingredient>wings</ingredient> at the middle joint, which can be done very skillfully by a little practice.

The <ingredient>wing</ingredient> is broken off the same way, only dividing the joint with the knife, in the direction from 1 to 2. The four quarters having been removed in this way, take off the merry-thought and the neck-bones; these last are to be removed by putting the knife in at figure 3 and 4, pressing it hard, when they will break off from the part that sticks to the <ingredient>breast.</ingredient> To separate the <ingredient>breast</ingredient> from the body of the <ingredient>fowl,</ingredient> cut through the tender <ingredient>ribs</ingredient> close to the <ingredient>breast,</ingredient> quite down to the tail.

<hd rend="bold" align="center">MODES OF FRYING.</hd><p>The usual custom among professional cooks is to entirely immerse the article to be cooked in boiling <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> but from inconvenience most households use the half-frying method of frying in a small amount of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in a frying-pan. For the first method a shallow iron frying-kettle, large at the top and small at the bottom, is best to use. The <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should half fill the kettle, or an amount sufficient to float whatever is to be fried; the heat of the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should get to such a degree that, when a piece of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or a teaspoonful of the batter is dropped in it, it will become brown almost instantly, but should not be so hot as to burn the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> Some cooks say that the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should be smoking, but my experience is, that is a mistake, as that soon ruins the <ingredient>fat.</ingredient> As soon as it begins to smoke it should be removed a little to one side, and still be kept at the boiling point. If fritters, crullers, croquettes, etc., are dropped into <ingredient>fat</ingredient> that is too hot, it crusts over the outside before the inside has fully risen, making a heavy hard article, and also ruining the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> giving it a burnt flavor.</p><p>Many French cooks prefer <ingredient>beef fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>suet</ingredient> to <ingredient>lard</ingredient> for frying purposes, considering it more wholesome and digestible, does not impart as much flavor, or adhere or soak into the article cooked as <ingredient>pork fat.</ingredient></p><p>In families of any size, where there is much cooking required, there are enough <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> and <ingredient>fat</ingredient> remnants from roasts of <ingredient>beef,</ingredient> skimmings from the <implement>soup-kettle,</implement> with the addition of occasionally a pound of <ingredient>suet</ingredient> from the market, to amply supply the need. All such remnants and skimmings should be clarified about twice a week, by boiling them all together in <ingredient>water.</ingredient> When the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is all melted, it should be strained with the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and set aside to cool. After the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> on the top has hardened, lift the cake from the <ingredient>water</ingredient> on which it lies, scrape off all the dark particles from the bottom, then melt over again the <ingredient>fat;</ingredient> while hot strain into a small clean stone jar or bright tin pail, and then it is ready for use. Always after frying anything, the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> should stand until it settles and has cooled somewhat; then turn off carefully so as to leave it clear from the sediment that settles at the bottom.</p> <pb n="41" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=57"/><p>Refined cotton-<ingredient>seed oil</ingredient> is now being adopted by most professional cooks in hotels, restaurants, and many private households for culinary purposes, and will doubtless in future supersede animal fats, especially for frying, it being quite as delicate a medium as frying with <ingredient>olive oil.</ingredient> It is now sold by leading grocers, put up in packages of two and four quarts.</p><p>The second mode of frying, using a frying-pan with a small quantity of <ingredient>fat</ingredient> or <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> to be done properly, should in the first place have the frying-pan hot over the fire, and the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> in it <emph rend="italic">actually boiling</emph> before the article to be cooked is placed in it, the intense heat quickly searing up the pores of the article and forming a brown crust on the lower side, then turning over and browning the other the same way.</p><p>Still, there is another mode of frying; the process is somewhat similar to broiling, the hot frying-pan or <implement>spider</implement> replacing the hot fire. To do this correctly, a thick bottom frying-pan should be used. Place it over the fire, and when it is so hot that it will siss, <ingredient>oil</ingredient> over the bottom of the pan with a piece of <ingredient>suet,</ingredient> that is if the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is all lean; if not, it is not necessary to <ingredient>grease</ingredient> the bottom of the pan. Lay in the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> quite flat, and brown it quickly, first on one side then on the other; when sufficiently cooked, dish on a <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> platter and season the same as <ingredient>broiled meats.</ingredient></p></section>

<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">Fish.</purpose>
In selecting <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> choose those only in which the eye is full and prominent, the flesh thick and firm, the scales bright and fins stiff. They should be thoroughly cleaned before cooking.</p><p>The usual modes of cooking <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are boiled, baked, broiled, fried and occassionally stewed. Steaming <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is much superior to boiling, but the ordinary conveniences in private houses do not admit of the possibility of enjoying this delicate way of cooking it. Large <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are generally boiled, medium-sized ones baked or boiled, the smaller kinds fried or broiled. Very large <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> such as cod, halibut, etc., are cut in <ingredient>steaks</ingredient> or slices for frying or broiling. The <ingredient>heads</ingredient> of some <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> as the <ingredient>cod,</ingredient> <ingredient>halibut,</ingredient> etc., are considered tidbits by many. Small <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> or pan <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> as they are usually called, are served without the <ingredient>heads,</ingredient> with the exception of brook-trouts and smelts; these are usually cooked whole, with the <ingredient>head</ingredient> on. Bake <ingredient>fish</ingredient> slowly, basting often with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Salmon is considered the most nutritious of all <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> When boiling <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> by adding a little <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> to the <ingredient>water,</ingredient> it seasons and prevents the nutriment from being drawn out; the <ingredient>vinegar</ingredient> acting on the <ingredient>water</ingredient> hardens the <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p> <pb n="42" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=58"/><p>Fill the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> with a nicely prepared <ingredient>stuffing</ingredient> of rolled <ingredient>cracker</ingredient> or <ingredient>stale bread crumbs,</ingredient> seasoned with <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> <ingredient>sage,</ingredient> and any other <ingredient>aromatic herbs</ingredient> fancied; sew up; wrap in a well-<ingredient>flour</ingredient>ed cloth, tied closely with twine, and boil or steam.

Unless the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> are small, they should never be put into <ingredient>warm water;</ingredient> nor should <ingredient>water,</ingredient> either hot or cold, be poured <emph rend="italic">on</emph> to the <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> as it is liable to break the <ingredient>skin</ingredient>: if it should be necessary to add a little <ingredient>water</ingredient> while the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel.</p><p><ingredient>Fish</ingredient> to be broiled should lie, after they are dressed, for two or three hours, with their inside well sprinkled with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient></p><p><ingredient>Salt fish</ingredient> should be soaked in <ingredient>water</ingredient> before boiling, according to the time it has been in <ingredient>salt.</ingredient> When it is hard and dry, it will require thirty-six hours soaking before it is dressed, and the <ingredient>water</ingredient> must be changed three or four times. When <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is not very <ingredient>salt,</ingredient> twenty-four hours, or even one night, will suffice.</p><p>When frying <ingredient>fish</ingredient> the fire must be hot enough to bring the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> to such a degree of heat as to sear the surface and make it impervious to the <ingredient>fat,</ingredient> and at the same time seal up the rich <ingredient>juices.</ingredient> As soon as the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> is browned by this sudden application of heat, the pan may be moved to a <implement>cooler</implement> place on the stove, that the process may be finished more slowly.</p><p><ingredient>Fat</ingredient> in which <ingredient>fish</ingredient> has been fried is just as good to use again for the same purpose, but it should be kept by itself and not be put to any other use.</p></recipe>

<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">TO FRY FISH.</purpose>
Most of the smaller <ingredient>fish</ingredient> (generally termed pan-<ingredient>fish</ingredient>) are usually fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces; season with <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper.</ingredient> Dip in <ingredient>Indian meal</ingredient> or <ingredient>wheat flour,</ingredient> or in beaten <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> and roll in <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or fine <ingredient>cracker crumbs</ingredient>--<ingredient>trout</ingredient> and <ingredient>perch</ingredient> should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed iron frying-pan, the flesh side down, with hot <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings;</ingredient> fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. The following method may be deemed preferable: Dredge the pieces with <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> brush them over with beaten <ingredient>egg;</ingredient> roll in <ingredient>bread crumbs,</ingredient> and fry in hot <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or <ingredient>drippings</ingredient> sufficient to cover, the same <pb n="43" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=59"/> as frying crullers. If the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> is very hot, the <ingredient>fish</ingredient> will fry without absorbing it, and it will be palatably cooked. When browned on one side, turn it over in the <ingredient>fat</ingredient> and brown the other, draining when done. This is a particularly good way to fry slices of large <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> Serve with <ingredient>tomato sauce;</ingredient> garnish with slices of <ingredient>lemon.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<hd rend="bold" align="center">POULTRY AND GAME.</hd><p>In choosing poultry, select those that are fresh and fat, and the surest way to determine whether they are young, is to try the skin under the leg or wing. If it is easily broken, it is young; or, turn the wing backwards, if the joint yields readily, it is tender. When poultry is young the skin is thin and tender, the legs smooth, the feet moist and limber, and the eyes full and bright. The body should be thick and the breast fat. Old turkeys have long hairs, and the flesh is purplish where it shows under the skin on the legs and back. About March they deteriorate in quality.</p><p>Young ducks and geese are plump, with light, semi-transparent fat,soft breast-bone, tender flesh, leg-joints which will break by the weight of the bird, fresh-colored and brittle beaks, and wind-pipes that break when pressed between the thumb and forefinger. They are best in fall and winter.</p><p>Young pigeons have light red flesh upon the breast, and full, fresh-colored legs; when the legs are thin and the breast very dark the birds are old.</p><p>Fine game birds are always heavy for their size; the flesh of the breast is firm and plump, and the skin clear; and if a few feathers be plucked from the inside of the leg and around the vent, the flesh of freshly-killed birds will be fat and fresh-colored; if it is dark and discolored, the game has been hung a long time. The wings of good ducks, geese, pheasants, and woodcock are tender to the touch; the tips of the long wing feathers of partridges are pointed in young birds and round in old ones. Quail, snipe and small birds should have full, tender breasts. Poultry should never be cooked until six or eight hours after it has been killed, but it should be picked and drawn as soon as possible. Plunge it in a pot of scalding hot water; then pluck off the feathers, taking care not to tear the skin; when it is picked clean, roll up a piece of white paper, set fire to it, and singe off all the hairs. The head, neck and feet should be cut off, and the ends of the legs skewered to the body, and a string tied tightly around the body. When roasting a chicken or small fowl there is danger of the legs browning <pb n="71" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=87"/> or becoming too hard to be eaten. To avoid this, take strips of cloth, dip them into a little melted lard, or even just rub them over with lard, and wind them around the legs. Remove them in time to allow the legs to brown delicately.</p><p>Fowls, and also various kinds of game, when bought at our city markets, require a more thorough cleansing than those sold in country places, where as a general thing the meat is wholly dressed. In large cities they lay for some length of time with the intestines undrawn, until the flavor of them diffuses itself all through the meat, rendering it distasteful. In this case, it is safe after taking out the intestines, to rinse out in several waters, and in next to the last water, add a teaspoonful of baking soda; say to a quart of water. This process neutralizes all sourness, and helps to destroy all unpleasant taste in the meat.</p><p>Poultry may be baked so that its wings and legs are soft and tender, by being placed in a deep <implement>roasting pan</implement> with close cover, thereby retaining the aroma and essences by absorption while confined. These pans are a recent innovation, and are made double with a small opening in the top for giving vent to the accumulation of steam and gases when required. Roast meats of any kind can also be cooked in the same manner, and it is a great improvement on the old plan.</p></section>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>In 
<purpose>roasting meat</purpose>
, allow from fifteen to twenty minutes to the pound, which will vary according to the thickness of the roast. A great deal of the success in roasting depends on the heat and goodness of the fire; if put into a cool oven it loses its juices, and the result is a tough, tasteless roast; whereas, if the oven is of the proper heat, it immediately sears up the pores of the meat and the juices are retained.</p><p>The oven should be the hottest when the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> is put into it, in order to quickly crisp the surface and close the pores of the meat, thereby confining its natural juices.

<purpose>Larding meats</purpose>

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>
<purpose>Boiling or stewing meat,</purpose>
if fresh, should be put into <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> water, closely covered, and boiled <emph rend="italic">slowly,</emph> allowing twenty minutes to each pound, and when partly cooked, or when it begins to get tender, salted, adding <ingredient>spices and vegetables.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<purpose>Salt meats</purpose>
should be covered with <ingredient><emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water,</ingredient> and require thirty minutes <emph rend="italic">very slow</emph> boiling, from the time the water boils, for each pound; if it is very salt, pour off the first water, and put it in another of boiling water, or it may be soaked one night in cold water.

<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>
<purpose>Frying</purpose>
may be done in two ways: one method, which is most generally used, is by putting one ounce or more (as the case requires) of beef drippings, lard or butter, into a frying-pan, and when at the <emph rend="italic">boiling point,</emph> laying in the meat, cooking both sides a nice brown. The other method is to <emph rend="italic">competely immerse</emph> the article to be cooked in sufficient <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> lard to cover it, similar to frying doughnuts.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="meatfishgame"><p>
<purpose>Broiled meats</purpose>
should be placed over clear, red coals, free from smoke, giving out a good heat, but not too brisk or the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> will be hardened and scorched; but if the fire is dead, the gravy will escape, and drop upon the coals, creating a blaze, which will blacken and smoke the meat. Steaks and chops should be turned often, in order that every part should be evenly done-never sticking a fork into the lean part, as that lets the juices escape; it should be put into the outer skin or fat. When the meat is sufficiently broiled, it should be laid on a <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> dish and seasoned. The best pieces for steak are the porter-house, sirloin, and rump.</p></recipe>
<section class1="household"><hd align="center" rend="bold">THAWING FROZEN MEAT, Etc.</hd><p>If meat, poultry, fish, vegetables, or any other article of food, when found frozen, is thawed by putting it into <emph rend="italic">warm water</emph> or placing it before the fire, it will most certainly spoil by that process, and be rendered unfit to eat. The only <pb n="96" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=112"/> way to thaw these things is by immersing them in <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> water. This should be done as soon as they are brought in from market, that they may have time to be well thawed before they are cooked. If meat that has been frozen is to be boiled, put it on in cold water. If to be roasted, begin by setting it at a distance from the fire; for if it should not chance to be thoroughly thawed all through to the centre, placing it at first too near the fire will cause it to spoil. If it is expedient to thaw the meat or poultry the night before cooking, lay it in cold water early in the evening, and change the water at bed-time. If found crusted with ice in the morning, remove the ice, and put the meat in fresh cold water, letting it lie in it till wanted for cooking.</p><p>Potatoes are injured by being frozen.

<section class1="household"><hd rend="bold" align="center">TO KEEP MEAT FROM FLIES.</hd><p>Put in sacks, with enough straw around it so the flies cannot reach through. Three-fourths of a yard of yard-wide muslin is the right size for the sack.

Be sure the straw is all around the meat, so the flies cannot reach through to deposit the eggs. (The sacking must be done early in the season before the fly appears.) Muslin lets the air in and is much better than paper.

The first consideration in broiling is to have a clear, glowing bed of coals.

Have everything else ready for the table; the <ingredient>potatoes and vegetables</ingredient> dished and in the warming closet. Do not season it until it is done, which will be in about ten to twelve minutes. Remove it to a warm platter, <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> and <ingredient>salt</ingredient> it on both sides and spread a liberal lump of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> over it.

Wash and peel some good <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> and cut them into slices the thickness of a penny-piece. The quantity of <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> must, of course, be decided according to the number of persons to whom they have to be served; but it is a safe plan to allow two, or even three, potatoes for each person. After the potatoes are sliced, wash them in two or three waters, to thoroughly cleanse them; then arrange them neatly (in layers) in a brown stone dish proper for baking purposes. Sprinkle a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> between each layer, and add a sufficient quantity of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> to prevent their burning. Place the dish in a very hot oven--on the top shelf--so as to brown the potatoes in a few minutes.

Add a little more <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and <ingredient>pepper,</ingredient> and <ingredient>water</ingredient> if required, and return the dish to a <implement>cooler</implement> part of the oven, where it may be allowed to remain until sufficiently cooked, which will be in about three-quarters of an hour. When the upper sides of the chops are a nice crisp brown, turn them over so as to brown the other side also. If, in the cooking, the potatoes appear to be getting too dry, a little more <ingredient>water</ingredient> may be gently poured in at one corner of the dish, only care must be taken to see that the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is hot this time-not cold, as at first. The dish in which the chops and potatoes are baked must be as <ingredient>neat</ingredient>-looking as possible, as it has to be sent to the table; turning the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> out would, of course, spoil their appearance.

<subsection class1="meatfishgame"><p>The best parts and those usually used for roasting are the loin, the leg, the shoulder, the spare-rib and chine. The hams, shoulders and middlings are usually salted, pickled and smoked. Pork requires more thorough cooking than most meats; if the least underdone it is unwholesome.</p><p>To choose pork: if the rind is thick and tough, and cannot be easily impressed with the finger, it is old; when fresh, it will look cool and smooth, and only corn-fed pork is good; swill or still-fed pork is unfit to cure. Fresh pork is in season from October to April. When dressing or stuffing is used, there are more or less herbs used for seasoining,--sage, summer savory, thyme, and sweet marjoram; these can be found (in the dried, pulverized form, put up in small, light packages) at most of the best druggists; still those raised and gathered at home are considered more fresh.</p></subsection>

<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>
<purpose>Vegetables</purpose>
of all kinds should be thoroughly picked over, throwing out all decayed or unripe parts, then well washed in several waters. Most vegetables, when peeled, are better when laid in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> a short time before cooking. When partly cooked a little <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should be thrown into the <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which they are boiled, and they should cook steadily after they are put on, not allowed to stop boiling or simmering until they are thoroughly done. Every sort of culinary vegetable is much better when freshly gathered and cooked as soon as possible, and , when done, thoroughly drained, and served immediately while hot.</p><p><ingredient>Onions,</ingredient> <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> <ingredient>carrots</ingredient> and <ingredient>turnips</ingredient> should be cooked in a great deal of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> boiled only long enough to sufficiently cook them, and immediately drained. Longer boiling makes them insipid in taste, and with <emph rend="italic">too little</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> they turn a dark color.</p><p><ingredient>Potatoes</ingredient> rank first in importance in the vegetable line, and consequently should be properly served. It requires some little intelligence to cook even so simple and common a dish as boiled potatoes. In the first place, all defective or green ones should be cast out; a bad one will flavor a whole dish. If they are not uniform in size, they should be made so by cutting after they are peeled. The best part of a <ingredient>potato</ingredient>, or the most nutritious, is next to the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> therefore they should be pared very thinly, if at all; then , if old, the cores should be cut out, thrown into <emph rend="italic">cold</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> salted a little, and boiled until soft enough for a fork to pierce through easily; drain immediately, and replace the kettle on the fire with the cover partly removed, until they are completely dried. New potatoes should be put into <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> and when partly done salted a little. They should be prepared just in time for cooking, by scraping off the thin outside <ingredient>skin.</ingredient> They require about twenty minutes to boil.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">TO BOIL NEW POTATOES.</purpose>
Do not have the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> dug long before they are dressed, as they are never good when they have been out of the ground some time. Well wash them, rub <pb n="170" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=190"/> off the skins with a coarse cloth, and put them in <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> salted. Let them boil until tender; try them with a fork, and when done pour the <ingredient>water</ingredient> away from them; let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of the sauce-pan partially removed, and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry, put them in a hot <implement>vegetable dish,</implement> with a piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of a walnut; pile the potatoes over this, and serve. If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off, boil them in their jackets; drain, peel and serve them as above, with a piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> placed in the midst of them. They require twenty to thirty minutes to cook. Serve them hot and plain, or with melted <ingredient>butter</ingredient> over them.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">MASHED POTATOES.</purpose>
Take the quantity needed, pare off the skins, and lay them in <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> half an hour; then put them into a sauce-pan, with a little <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> cover with <ingredient>water</ingredient> and boil them until done. Drain off the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and mash them fine with a <implement>potato-masher.</implement> Have ready a piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of an egg, melted in half a cup of boiling hot <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> and a good pinch of <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> mix it well with the mashed <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> until they are a smooth <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> taking care that they are not too wet. Put them into a <implement>vegetable dish,</implement> heap them up and smooth over the top, put a small piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on the top in the centre, and have dots of <ingredient>pepper</ingredient> here and there on the surface as large as a half dime.</p><p>Some prefer using a heavy fork or <implement>wire-beater,</implement> instead of a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> beating the <ingredient>potatoes</ingredient> quite light, and heaping them up in the dish without smoothing over the top.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">BROWNED POTATOES.</purpose>
Mash them the same as the above, put them into a dish that they are to be served in, smooth over the top, and brush over with the <ingredient>yolk of an egg,</ingredient> or spread on a bountiful supply of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and dust well with <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> Set in the oven to brown; it will brown in fifteen minutes with a quick fire.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="fruitvegbeans"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">MASHED POTATOES, (Warmed Over.)</purpose>

Mix the whole until thoroughly light; then put into a pudding or <implement>vegetable dish,</implement> spread a little <ingredient>butter</ingredient> over the top, and bake a golden brown. The quality depends upon very thoroughly beating the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> before adding them, so that the <ingredient>potato</ingredient>will remain light and porous after baking, similar to sponge-cake.</p></recipe>

As each layer of <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> is added, it must be pressed down by a large and heavy <implement>pestle,</implement> and fresh layers are added as soon as the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> floats on the surface. The <ingredient>cabbage</ingredient> must be seasoned with a few grains of <ingredient>coriander,</ingredient> <ingredient>juniper berries,</ingredient> etc. When the barrel is full it must be put in a dry cellar, covered with a cloth, under a plank, and on this heavy weights are placed. At the end of a few days it will begin to ferment, during which time the <ingredient>pickle</ingredient> must be drawn off and replaced by fresh, until the liquor becomes clear. This should be done every day. Renew the cloth and wash the cover, put the weights back, and let stand for a month. By that time the sour-crout will be ready for use. Care must be taken to let the least possible air enter the sour-crout, and to have the cover perfectly clean. Each time the barrel has to be opened it must be properly closed again. These precautions must not be neglected.</p><p>This is often fried in the same manner as fried <ingredient>cabbage,</ingredient> excepting it is first boiled until soft in just <ingredient>water</ingredient> enough to cook it, then fry and add <ingredient>vinegar.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<section class1="eggscheesedairy"><p>There are so many ways of cooking and dressing eggs, that it seems unnecessary for the ordinary family to use only those that are the most practical.</p><p>To ascertain the freshness of an egg, hold it between your thumb and forefinger in a horizontal position, with a strong light in front of you. The fresh egg will have a clear appearance, both upper and lower sides being the same. The stale egg will have a clear appearance at the lower side, while the upper side will exhibit a dark or cloudy appearance.</p><p>Another test is to put them in a pan of cold water; those that are the first to sink are the freshest; the stale will rise and float on top; or, if the large end turns up in the water, they are not fresh. The best time for preserving eggs is from July to September.</p></section>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">TO PRESERVE EGGS.</purpose>
There are several recipes for preserving <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> and we give first one which we know to be effectual, keeping them fresh from August until Spring. Take a piece of <ingredient>quick-lime</ingredient> as large as a good-sized <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> and two teacupfuls of <ingredient>salt;</ingredient> put it into a large vessel and slack it with a gallon of <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> It will boil and bubble until thick as <ingredient>cream;</ingredient> when it is cold, pour off the top, which will be perfectly clear. Drain off this liquor, and pour it over your <ingredient>eggs;</ingredient> see that the liquor more than covers them. A stone jar is the most convenient; --one that holds about six quarts.</p><p>Another manner of preserving <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> is to pack them in a jar with layers of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> between, the large end of the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> downward, with a thick layer of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> at the top; cover tightly, and set in a cool place.</p><p>Some put them in a wire basket or a piece of mosquito net, and dip them in <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> half a minute; then pack in saw-dust. Still another manner is to dissolve a cheap article of <ingredient>gum arabic,</ingredient> about as thin as mucilage, and brush over each <ingredient>egg</ingredient> with it; then pack in powdered <ingredient>charcoal;</ingredient> set in a cool, dark place.</p> <pb n="200" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=220"/><p><ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> can be kept for some time by smearing the shells with <ingredient>butter</ingredient> or <ingredient>lard;</ingredient> then packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> not allowed to touch one another; or coat the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> with melted paraffine.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">BOILED EGGS.</purpose>
<ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid; but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid <ingredient>egg</ingredient> than for one that is three or four days old. Have ready a sauce-pan of <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> put the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> into it gently with a spoon, letting the spoon touch the bottom of the sauce-pan before it is withdrawn, that the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> may not fall, and consequently crack. For those who like <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> lightly boiled, three minutes will be found sufficient; three and three-quarters to four minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; and if liked hard, six or seven minutes will not be found too long. Should the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> be unusually large, as those of black Spanish <ingredient>fowls</ingredient> sometimes are, allow an extra half minutes for them. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> for salad should be boiled for ten or fifteen minutes, and should be placed in a basin of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> for a few minutes, to shrink the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> from the shell; they should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel off easily.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="eggscheesedairy"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">SOFT BOILED EGGS.</purpose>
When properly cooked, <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> are done evenly through, like any other food.

The heat of the <ingredient>water</ingredient> cooks the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> slowly, evenly and sufficiently, leaving the centre, or <ingredient>yolk,</ingredient> harder than the white, and the <ingredient>egg</ingredient> tastes as much richer and nicer as a fresh <ingredient>egg</ingredient> is nicer than a stale <ingredient>egg.</ingredient></p></recipe>

<hd rend="bold" align="center" size="larger">BREAD.</hd>
<section><p>Among all civilized people bread has become an article of food of the first necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of itself a complete life sustainer, the gluten, starch and sugar which it contains representing ozotized and hydrocarbonated nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product. As there is no one article of food that enters so largely into our daily fare as bread, so no degree of skill in preparing other articles can compensate for lack of knowledge in the art of making good, palatable and nutritious bread. A little earnest attention to the subject will enable any one to comprehend the theory, and then ordinary care in practice will make one familiar with the process.</p></section>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p>
<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">GENERAL DIRECTIONS.</purpose>
The first thing required for making wholesome <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is the utmost cleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it; and, in addition to these, there must be attention and care through the whole process.</p><p><ingredient>Salt</ingredient> is always used in bread-making, not only on account of its flavor, which destroys the insipid raw state of the <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> but because it makes the dough rise better.</p><p>In mixing with <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be boiled--not simply scalded, but heated to boiling over <ingredient>hot water</ingredient>--then set aside to cool before mixing. Simple heating will not prevent <ingredient>bread</ingredient> from turning sour in the rising, while boiling will act as a preventive. So the <ingredient>milk</ingredient> should be thoroughly scalded, and should be used when it is just blood warm.</p><p>Too small a proportion of <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise, will cause the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> to be heavy.</p><p>The <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> must be good and fresh if the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is to be digestible and nice. Stale <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an acetous fermentation, <pb n="212" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=232"/> which flavors the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and makes it disagreeable. A poor, thin <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> produces an imperfect fermentation, the result being a heavy unwholesome loaf.</p><p>If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself--that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either--sour <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will probably be the consequence in warm weather, and bad <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in any. The goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation.</p><p>Heavy <ingredient>bread</ingredient> will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hard, and letting it become quite cold, particularly in winter.</p><p>An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made, and to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most common causes of failure are using <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> which is no longer sweet, or which has been frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it.</p><p>As a general rule, the oven for baking <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should be rather quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside. The oven-door should not be opened after the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is put in until the dough is set or has become firm, as the cool air admitted will have an unfavorable effect on it.</p><p>The dough should rise and the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> begin to brown after about fifteen minutes, but only slightly. Bake from fifty to sixty minutes, and have it brown, not black or whitey brown, but brown all over when well baked.</p><p>When the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is baked, remove the loaves immediately from the pans, and place them where the air will circulate freely around them and thus carry off the gas which has been formed, but is no longer needed.</p><p>Never leave the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in the pan or on a pine table to absorb the odor of the wood. If you like crusts that are crisp do not cover the loaves; but to give the soft, tender, wafer-like consistency which many prefer, wrap them, while still hot, in several thicknesses of bread-cloth. When cold put them in a stone jar, removing the cloth, as that absorbs the moisture and gives the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> an unpleasant taste and odor. Keep the jar well covered, and carefully cleansed from crumbs and stale pieces. Scald and dry it thoroughly every two or three days. A yard and a half square of coarse table linen makes the best bread-cloth. Keep in good supply; use them for no other purpose.</p><p>Some people use scalding <ingredient>water</ingredient> in making <ingredient>wheat bread;</ingredient> in that case the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> must be scalded and allowed to cool before the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is added,--then proceed as above. <ingredient>Bread</ingredient> made in this manner keeps moist in summer, much longer than when made in the usual mode.</p><p>Home-made <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> is generally preferred to any other. Compressed <ingredient>yeast,</ingredient> as <pb n="213" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=233"/> now sold in most grocery stores, makes fine light, sweet <ingredient>bread,</ingredient> and is a much quicker process, and can always be had fresh, being made fresh every day.</p></recipe>

<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">WHEAT BREAD.</purpose>
Sift the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into a large bread-pan or bowl; make a hole in the middle of it, and pour in the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> in the ratio of half a teacupful of <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> to two quarts of <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> stir the <ingredient>yeast</ingredient> lightly, then pour in your "wetting," either <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>water,</ingredient> as you choose,--which use warm in winter, and cold in summer; if you use <ingredient>water</ingredient> as "wetting," dissolve in it a bit of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> of the size of an <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> --if you use <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> no <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is necessary; stir in the "wetting" very lightly, but do not mix all the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> into it; then cover the pan with a thick blanket or towel, and set it, in winter, in a warm place to rise,--this is call "<emph rend="italic">putting the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in sponge."</emph> In summer the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> should not be wet over night. In the morning add a teaspoonful of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and mix all the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in the pan with the sponge, kneading it well; then let it stand two hours or more until it has risen quite light; then removethe dough to the <implement>molding-board</implement> and mold it for a long time, cutting it in pieces and molding them together again and again, until the dough is elastic under the pressure of your hand, using as little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as possible; then make it into loaves, put the loaves into <implement>baking-tins.</implement> The loaves should come half-way up the pan, and they should be allowed to rise until the bulk is doubled. When the loaves are ready to be put into the oven, the oven should be ready to receive them. It should be hot enough to brown a teaspoonful of <ingredient>flour</ingredient> in five minutes. The heat should be greater at the bottom than at the top of the oven, and the fire so arranged as to give sufficient strength of heat through the baking without being replenished. Let them stand ten or fifteen minutes, prick them three or four times with a fork, bake in a quick oven from forty-five to sixty minutes.</p><p>If these directions are followed, you will obtain sweet, tender and wholesome <ingredient>bread.</ingredient> If by any mistake the dough becomes sour before you are ready to bake it, you can rectify it by adding a little dry supercarbonate of <ingredient>soda,</ingredient> molding the dough a long time to distribute the <ingredient>soda</ingredient> equally thoroughout the mass. All <ingredient>bread</ingredient> is better, if naturally sweet, without the <ingredient>soda;</ingredient> but <emph rend="italic">sour <ingredient>bread</ingredient></emph> you should never eat, if you desire good health.</p><p>Keep well covered in a tin box or large <implement>stone crock,</implement> which should be wiped out every day or two, and scalded and dried thoroughly in the sun once a week.</p></recipe>

In making batter-cakes, the ingredients should be put together over night to rise, and the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and <ingredient>butter</ingredient> added in the morning; the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> melted and <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> well-beaten. If the batter appears sour int eh least, dissolve a little <ingredient>soda</ingredient> and stir into it; this should be done early enough to rise some time before baking.</p><p><ingredient>Water</ingredient> can be used in place of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> in all raised dough, and the dough should be thoroughly light before making into loaves or <ingredient>biscuits;</ingredient> then when molding <pb n="222" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=242"/> them, use as little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> as possible; the kneading to be done when first made from the sponge, and should be done well and for some length of time, as this makes the pores fine, the <ingredient>bread</ingredient> cut smooth and tender.

<purpose placement="heading" align="center" rend="bold">TO RENEW STALE ROLLS.</purpose>

Dough, after it has become once sufficiently raised and perfectly light, cannot afterwards be injured by setting aside in any cold place where it cannot <emph rend="italic">freeze</emph>; therefore, <ingredient>biscuits,</ingredient> rolls, etc., can be made late the day before wanted for breakfast. Prepare them ready for baking by molding them out late in the evening; lay them a little apart on buttered tins; cover the tins with a cloth, then fold around that a newspaper, so as to exclude the air, as that has a tendency to cause the crust to be hard and thick when baked. The best place in summer is to place them in the <implement>ice-box,</implement> then all you have to do in the morning (an hour before breakfast time, and while the oven is heating) is to bring them from the <implement>ice-box,</implement> take off the cloth and warm it, and place it over them again; then set the tins in a warm place near the fire.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">SUGGESTIONS IN REGARD TO CAKE MAKING.</purpose>
Use none but the best materials, and all the ingredients should be properly prepared before commencing to mix any of them. <ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> beat up much lighter and sooner by being placed in a cold place some time before using them; a small pinch of <ingredient>soda</ingredient> sometimes has the same effect. <ingredient>Flour</ingredient> should always be sifted before using it. <ingredient>Cream of tartar</ingredient> or baking-powder should be thoroughly mixed with the <ingredient>flour;</ingredient> <ingredient>butter</ingredient> be placed where it will become moderately soft, but <emph rend="italic">not</emph> melted in the least, or the cake will be sodden and heavy. <ingredient>Sugar</ingredient> should be rolled and sifted; <ingredient>spices</ingredient> ground or pounded; <ingredient>raisins</ingredient> or any other <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> looked over and prepared; <ingredient>currants,</ingredient> especially, should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and then carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them. They should then be laid on a dish before the fire to become thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy.</p><p><ingredient>Eggs</ingredient> should be well-beaten, the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> and <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> separately, the <ingredient>yolks</ingredient> to a thick <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> until they are a stiff froth. Always stir the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to a <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> then add the beaten <ingredient>yolks,</ingredient> then the <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> the flavoring, then the beaten <ingredient>whites,</ingredient> and lastly the <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> If <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is to be used, measure and dredge with a little sifted <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> stir in gradually and thoroughly.</p><p>Pour all in well-buttered cake-pans. While the cake is baking, care should be taken that no cold air enters the oven, only when necessary to see that the cake is baking properly; the oven should be an even, moderate heat, not too cold or too hot; much depends on this for success.</p><p>Cake is often spoiled for being looked at too often when first put into the oven. The heat should be tested before the cake is put in, which can be done by throwing on the floor of the oven a tablespoonful of new <ingredient>flour.</ingredient> If the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> takes fire, or assumes a dark-brown color, the temperature is too high, and the <pb n="252" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=274"/> oven must be allowed to cool; if the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> remains <ingredient>white</ingredient> after the lapse of a few seconds, the temperature is too low. When the oven is of the proper temperature, the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> will slightly brown and look slightly scorched.</p><p>Another good way to test the heat, is to drop a few spoonfuls of the cake, batter on a small piece of buttered letter-<ingredient>paper,</ingredient> and place it in the oven during the finishing of the cake, so that the piece will be baked before putting in the whole cake; if the little drop of cake-batter bakes evenly without burning around the edge, it will be safe to put the whole cake in the oven. Then again if the oven seems too hot, fold a thick brown paper double, and lay on the bottom of the oven; then after the cake has risen, put a thick brown paper over the top, or <ingredient>butter</ingredient> well a thick <ingredient>white paper</ingredient> and lay carefully over the top.</p><p>If, after the cake is put in, it seems to bake too fast, put a brown <ingredient>paper</ingredient> loosely over the top of the pan, care being taken that it does not touch the cake, and do not open the door for five minutes at least; the cake should then be quickly examined, and the door shut carefully, or the rush of cold air will cause it to fall. Setting a <emph rend="italic">small dish</emph> of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> in the oven, will also prevent the cake from scorching.</p><p>To ascertain when the cake is done, run a broom straw into the middle of it; if it comes out clean and smooth, the cake will do to take out.</p><p>Where the recipe calls for <ingredient>baking powder,</ingredient> and you have none, you can use <ingredient>cream tartar</ingredient> and <ingredient>soda</ingredient> in proportion to one level teaspoonful of <ingredient>soda,</ingredient> two heaping teaspoonfuls of <ingredient>cream tartar.</ingredient></p><p>When <ingredient>sour milk</ingredient> is called for in the recipe, use only <ingredient>soda.</ingredient> Cakes made with <ingredient>molasses</ingredient> burn much more easily than those made with <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient></p><p>Never stir cake after the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> and <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is creamed, but beat it down from the bottom, up, and over; this laps air into the cake-batter, and produces little air cells, which causes the dough to puff and swell when it comes in contact with the heat while cooking.</p><p>When making most cakes, especially sponge cake, the <ingredient>flour</ingredient> should be added by degrees, stirred very slowly and lightly, for if stirred hard and fast it will make it porous and tough.</p><p>Cakes should be kept in tight tin cake-cans, or earthern jars, in a cool, dry place.</p><p>Cookies, jumbles, ginger-snaps, etc., require a quick oven; if they become moist or soft by keeping, put again into the oven a few minutes.</p><p>To remove a cake from a tin after it is baked, so that it will not crack, break or fall, first <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the tin well all around the sides and bottom; then cut a piece of letter-<ingredient>paper</ingredient> to exactly fit the tin, <ingredient>butter</ingredient> that on both sides, placing <pb n="253" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=275"/> it smoothly on the bottom and sides of the tin. When the cake is baked, let it remain in the tin until it is <emph rend="italic">cold;</emph> then set it in the oven a minute, or just long enough to warm the tin through. Remove it from the oven; turn it upside down on your hand, tap the edge of the tin on the table and it will slip out with ease, leaving it whole.</p><p>If a cake-pan is too shallow for holding the quantity of cake to be baked, for fear of its being so light as to rise above the pan, that can be remedied by thoroughly greasing a piece of thick glazed letter-paper with soft <ingredient>butter.</ingredient> Place or fit it around the sides of the buttered tin, allowing it to reach an inch or more above the top. If the oven heat is moderate, the <ingredient>butter</ingredient> will <ingredient>preserve</ingredient> the paper from burning.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">FROSTING OR ICING.</purpose>
In the first place, the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> should be cold, and the platter on which they are to be beaten also cold. Allow, for the <ingredient>white of one egg,</ingredient> one small teacupful of <ingredient>powdered sugar.</ingredient> Break the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> and throw a small handful of the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> on them as soon as you begin beating; keep adding it at intervals until it is all used up. The <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> must <emph rend="italic">not</emph> be beaten until the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> has been added in this way, which gives a smooth, tender frosting, and one that will dry much sooner than the old way.</p><p>Spread with a broad knife evenly over the cake, and if it seems too thin, beat in a little more <ingredient>sugar.</ingredient> Cover the cake with two coats, the second after the first has become dry, or nearly so. If the icing gets too dry or stiff before the last coat is needed, it can be thinned sufficiently with a little <ingredient>water,</ingredient> enough to make it work smoothly.</p><p>A little <ingredient>lemon-juice,</ingredient> or half a teaspoonful of <ingredient>tartaric acid,</ingredient> added to the frosting while being beaten, makes it <ingredient>white</ingredient> and more frothy.</p><p>The flavors mostly used are <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> <ingredient>vanilla,</ingredient> <ingredient>almond,</ingredient> rose, <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> and <ingredient>orange.</ingredient> If you wish to ornament with figures or flowers, make up rather more icing, keep about one-third out until that on the cake is dried; then, with a clean, glass <implement>syringe,</implement> apply it in such forms as you desire and dry as before; what you keep out to ornament with may be tinted pink with <ingredient>cochineal,</ingredient> blue with <ingredient>indigo,</ingredient> yellow with <ingredient>saffron</ingredient> or the grated <ingredient>rind</ingredient> of an <ingredient>orange</ingredient> strained through a cloth, green with <ingredient>spinach juice,</ingredient> and brown with <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> purple with <ingredient>cochineal and indigo.</ingredient> <ingredient>Strawberry,</ingredient> or <ingredient>currant</ingredient> and <ingredient>cranberry juices</ingredient> color a delicate pink.</p><p>Set the cake in a cool oven with the door open, to dry, or in a draught in an open window.</p></recipe>

<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">ALMOND FROSTING.</purpose>
The <ingredient>whites of three eggs,</ingredient> beaten up with three cups of fine, <ingredient>white sugar.</ingredient> Blanch a pound of <ingredient>sweet almonds,</ingredient> pound them in a <implement>mortar</implement> with a little <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> until a fine <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> then add the <ingredient>whites of eggs,</ingredient> <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>vanilla extract.</ingredient> Pound a few minutes to thoroughly mix. Cover the cake with a very thick coating of this, set in a cool oven to dry, afterwards cover with a plain icing.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">CHOCOLATE FROSTING.</purpose>
The <ingredient>whites of four eggs,</ingredient> three cups of <ingredient>powdered sugar,</ingredient> and nearly a cup of grated <ingredient>chocolate.</ingredient> Beat the <ingredient>whites</ingredient> a very little, they must not become <ingredient>white;</ingredient> stir in the <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> then put in the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> gradually, beating to mix it well.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">PLAIN CHOCOLATE ICING.</purpose>
Put into a shallow pan four tablespoonfuls of scraped <ingredient>chocolate,</ingredient> and place it where it will melt gradually, but not scorch; when melted, stir in three tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>milk</ingredient> or <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and one of <ingredient>water;</ingredient> mix all well together, and add one scant teacupful of <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> boil about five minutes, and while hot, and when the cakes are nearly cold, spread some evenly over the surface of one of the cakes; put a second one on top, alternating the mixture and cakes; then cover top and sides, and set in a warm oven to harden. All who have tried recipe after recipe, vainly hoping to find one where the <ingredient>chocolate</ingredient> sticks to the cake and not to the fingers, will appreciate the above. In making those most palatable of cakes, "<ingredient>Chocolate</ingredient> Eclairs," the recipe just given will be found very satisfactory.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TUTTI FRUTTI ICING.</purpose>
Mix with boiled icing one ounce each of chopped <ingredient>citron,</ingredient> <ingredient>candied cherries,</ingredient> <ingredient>seedless raisins,</ingredient> <ingredient>candied pineapple,</ingredient> and blanched <ingredient>almonds.</ingredient></p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">SUGAR ICING.</purpose>
To one pound of extra <ingredient>refined sugar,</ingredient> add one ounce of fine <ingredient>white starch;</ingredient> pound finely together, and then sift them through gauze; then beat the <ingredient>whites of three eggs</ingredient> to a froth. The secret of success is to beat the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> long enough, and always one way; add the <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> by degrees, or it will spoil the froth of the <ingredient>eggs.</ingredient> When all the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> is stirred in, continue the whipping for half an hour longer, adding more <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> if the ice is too thin. Take a little of the icing and lay it aside for ornamenting afterward. When the cake comes out of the oven, spread the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> icing smoothly over it with a knife, and dry <pb n="255" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=277"/> it at once in a cool oven. For ornamenting the cake, the icing may be tinged any color preferred. For pink, use a few drops of <ingredient>cochineal;</ingredient> for yellow a pinch of <ingredient>saffron,</ingredient> dissolved; for green, the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> of some chopped <ingredient>spinach.</ingredient> Whichever is chosen, let the coloring be first mixed with a little colorless <ingredient>spirit,</ingredient> and then stirred into the <ingredient>white</ingredient> icing until the tint is deep enough. To ornament the cake with it, make a cone of stiff writing <ingredient>paper,</ingredient> and squeeze the colored icing through it, so as to form leaves, beading or letters, as the case may be. It requires nicety and care to do it with success.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">BOILED FROSTING.</purpose>
To one pound of finest pulverised <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> add three wine-glassfuls of clear <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Let it stand until it dissolves; then boil it until it is perfectly clear and threads from the spoon. Beat well the <ingredient>whites of four eggs.</ingredient> Pour the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> into the dish with the <ingredient>eggs,</ingredient> but do not mix them until the <ingredient>syrup</ingredient> is luke-warm; then beat all well together for one half hour.</p><p>Season to your taste with <ingredient>vanilla,</ingredient> <ingredient>rose-water,</ingredient> or <ingredient>lemon-juice.</ingredient> The first coating may be put on the cake as soon as it is well mixed. Rub the cake with a little <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before you apply the icing. While the first coat is drying, continue to beat the remainder; you will not have to wait long if the cake is set in a warm place near the fire. This is said to be a most excellent recipe for icing.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">FROSTING WITHOUT EGGS.</purpose>
An excellent frosting may be made without <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> or <ingredient>gelatine,</ingredient> which will keep longer, and cut more easily, causing no breakage or crumbling, and withal is very economical.</p><p>Take one cup of <ingredient>granulated sugar;</ingredient> dampen it with one-fourth of a cup of <ingredient>milk,</ingredient> or five tablespoonfuls; place it on the fire in a suitable dish, and stir it until it boils; then let it boil for five minutes without stirring; remove it from the fire and set the dish in another of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> add flavoring. While it is cooling, stir or beat it constantly, and it will become a thick, creamy frosting.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="accompaniments"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">GELATINE FROSTING.</purpose>
Soak one teaspoonful of <ingredient>gelatine</ingredient> in one tablespoonful of <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> half an hour, dissolve in two tablespoonfuls of <ingredient>hot water;</ingredient> add one cup of <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> and stir until smooth.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">GOLDEN FROSTING.</purpose>
A very delicious and handsome frosting can be made by using the <ingredient>yolks of eggs</ingredient> instead of the <ingredient>whites.</ingredient> Proceed exactly as for ordinary frosting. It will harden just as nicely as that does. This is particularly good for <ingredient>orange</ingredient> cake, <pb n="256" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=278"/> harmonizing with the color of the cake in a way to please those who love rich coloring.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">GENERAL REMARKS.</purpose>
Use the very best materials in making pastry; the <ingredient>shortening</ingredient> should be fresh, sweet, and hard; the <ingredient>water</ingredient> cold (ice <ingredient>water</ingredient> is best), the paste rolled on a cold board, and all handled as little as possible.</p><p>When the crust is made, it makes it much more flakey and puff much more to put it in a dish covered with a cloth, and set in a very cold place for half an hour, or even an hour; in summer, it could be placed in the <implement>ice box.</implement></p><p>A great improvement is made in pie-crust by the addition of about a heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder to a quart of <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> also brushing the paste as often as rolled out, and the pieces of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> placed thereon, with the <ingredient>white of an egg,</ingredient> assists it to rise in <emph rend="italic">leaves</emph> or <emph rend="italic">flakes.</emph> As this is the great beauty of <ingredient>puff-paste,</ingredient> it is as well to try this method.</p><p>If <ingredient>currants</ingredient> are to be used in pies, they should be carefully picked over, and washed in several waters, dried in a towel, and dredged with <ingredient>flour</ingredient> before they are suitable for use.</p><p><ingredient>Raisins,</ingredient> and all <ingredient>dried fruits</ingredient> for pies and cakes, should be seeded, stoned, and dredged with <ingredient>flour,</ingredient> before using.</p><p><ingredient>Almonds</ingredient> should be blanched by pouring <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> upon them, and then slipping the skin off with the fingers. In pounding them, always add a little rose or <ingredient>orange water,</ingredient> with fine <ingredient>sugar,</ingredient> to prevent their becoming oily.</p><p>Great care is requisite in heating an oven for baking pastry. If you can hold your hand in the heated oven while you count twenty, the oven has just the proper temperature, and it should be kept at this temperature as long as the pastry is in; this heat will bake to a light brown, and will give the pastry a fresh and flakey appearance. If you suffer the heat to abate, the under crust will become heavy and clammy, and the upper crust will fall in.</p> <pb n="285" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=307"/><p>Another good way to ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for <ingredient>puff-paste</ingredient>: put a small piece of the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> in previous to baking the whole, and then the heat can thus be judged of.</p><p>Pie-crust can be kept a week, and the last be better than the first, if put in a tightly covered dish, and set in the <implement>ice-chest</implement> in summer, and in a cool place in winter, and thus you can make a fresh pie every day with little trouble.</p><p>In baking custard, <ingredient>pumpkin</ingredient> or <ingredient>squash</ingredient> pies, it is well, in order that the mixture may not be absorbed by the <ingredient>paste,</ingredient> to first partly bake the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> before adding it, and when stewed <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> is used the filling should be perfectly cool when put in, or it will make the bottom crust sodden.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">HOW TO MAKE A PIE.</purpose>
After making the crust, take a portion of it, roll it out and fit it to a buttered <implement>pie-plate</implement> by cutting it off evenly around the edge; gather up the scraps left from cutting and make into another sheet for the top crust; roll it a little thinner than the under crust; lap one half over the other and cut three or four slits about a quarter of an inch from the folded edge, (this prevents the steam from escaping through the rim of the pie, and causing the <ingredient>juices</ingredient> to run out from the edges). Now fill your <implement>pie-plate</implement> with your prepared filling, wet the top edge of the rim, lay the upper crust across the centre of the pie, turn back the half that is lapped over, seal the two edges together by slightly pressing down with your thumb, then notch evenly and regularly with a three-tined fork, dipping occasionally in <ingredient>flour</ingredient> to prevent sticking. Bake in a rather quick oven a light brown, and until the filling boils up through the slits in the upper crust.</p><p>To prevent the <ingredient>juice</ingredient> soaking through into the crust, making it soggy, wet the under crust with the <ingredient>white of an egg,</ingredient> just before you put in the pie mixture. If the top of the pie is brushed over with the <ingredient>egg,</ingredient> it gives it a beautiful glaze.</p></recipe>
<recipe class1="breadsweets"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">FOR ICING PASTRY.</purpose>
To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> tarts and sweet dishes of pastry, put the <ingredient>white of an egg</ingredient> on a plate, and with the blade of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush it over with this, and sift over some pounded <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> put it back into the oven to set the glaze, and in a few minutes it will be done. Great care should be taken that the <ingredient>paste</ingredient> does not catch or burn in the oven, which it is very liable to do after the icing is laid on.</p><p>Or make a meringue by adding a tablespoonful of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> to the beaten <ingredient>white of an egg.</ingredient> Spread over the top, and slightly brown in the oven.</p></recipe>

Drop them into <ingredient>boiling water,</ingredient> letting them remain until the <ingredient>water</ingredient> is cold.

They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh <ingredient>powdered sugar</ingredient> being sifted over them every time they are turned. Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry situation, in drawers or boxes. <ingredient>Currants</ingredient> and <ingredient>cherries</ingredient> preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, are extremely elegant, and have a fine flavor.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" size="larger" rend="bold">CANNED FRUITS.</purpose>
<ingredient>Berries</ingredient> and all ripe, mellow <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> require but little cooking, only long enough for the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> to penetrate. Strew <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> over them, allow them to stand a few hours, then merely scald with the <ingredient>sugar;</ingredient> half to three-quarters of a pound is considered sufficient. Harder <ingredient>fruits</ingredient> like <ingredient>pears,</ingredient> <ingredient>quinces,</ingredient> etc., require longer boiling.</p><p>The great secret of canning is to make the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> or vegetable perfectly airtight. It must be put up boiling hot, and the vessel filled to the brim.</p><p>Have your jars conveniently placed near your boiling <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> in a tin pan of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> on the stove, roll them in the <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> then fill immediately with the hot, scalding <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> fill to the top, and seal quickly with the tops, which should also be heated; occasionally screw down the tops tighter, as the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> shrinks as it cools, and the glass contracts, and allows the air to enter the cans. They must be perfectly air-tight. The jars to be kept in a dark, cool, dry place.</p><p>Use glass jars for <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> always, and the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be cooked in a porcelain or granite-iron kettle. If you are obliged to use common large-mouthed bottles with corks, steam the corks and pare them to a close fit, driving them in with a mallet. Use the following wax for sealing: one pound of <ingredient>resin,</ingredient> three ounces of <ingredient>beeswax,</ingredient> one and one-half ounces of <ingredient>tallow.</ingredient> Use a brush in covering the corks, and as they cool, dip the mouth into the melted wax. Place in a basin of cool <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Pack in a cool, dark, and dry cellar. After one week, examine for flaws, cracks or signs of ferment.</p><p>The <implement>rubber</implement> rings used to assist in keeping the air from the <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> cans sometimes become so dry and brittle as to be almost useless. They can be restored to normal condition usually by letting them lie in <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which you have put a little <ingredient>ammonia.</ingredient> Mix in this proportion: One part of <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> and two parts <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Sometimes they do not need to lie in this more than five minutes, but frequently a half-hour is needed to restore their elasticity.</p></recipe>

Let the sugared <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> remain on the range, but away from the fire, until upon tipping the vessel to one side you can see some liquid; then fill the jars, taking them out of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> into which they were put when cold, remaining until it was made to boil around them. In this way you will find out if the glass has been properly annealed; for we consider glass jars with stoppers screwing down upon India-<implement>rubber</implement> rings as the best for canning <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> in families. They should be kept in a dark closet; and although somewhat more expensive than tin in the first instance, are much nicer, and keep for years with careful usage.</p><p><ingredient>Fruit</ingredient> must be of fine flavor, and <emph rend="italic">ripe</emph>, though not <emph rend="italic">soft</emph>, to make nice canned <ingredient>fruit.</ingredient></p><p><ingredient>Peaches</ingredient> should be thrown into <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> as they are peeled, to prevent a yellowish crust.</p></recipe>

Canning <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> is quite a simple process. A large or small quantity may be done at a time, and they should be put in glass jars in preference to those of tin, which are apt to injure the flavor. Very ripe <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient>are the best for the purpose. They are first put into a large pan and covered with <ingredient>boiling water.</ingredient> This loosens the <ingredient>skin,</ingredient> which is easily removed, and the <ingredient>tomatoes</ingredient> are then put into the <implement>preserving kettle,</implement> set over a moderate fire without the addition of <ingredient>water</ingredient> or any <ingredient>seasoning,</ingredient> and brought to a boil.

Split the kernels lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the back of the knife, thus leaving the hulls upon the <ingredient>cob.</ingredient> Fill cans full of cut <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> pressing it in very hard. To press the <ingredient>corn</ingredient> in the can, use the small end of a <implement>potato-masher,</implement> as this will enter the can easily. It will take from ten to a dozen large <ingredient>ears of corn</ingredient> to fill a one-quart can. When the cans are full, screw cover on with thumb and first finger; this will be tight enough, then place a cloth in the bottom of a <implement>wash boiler</implement> to prevent breakage. On this put a layer of cans in any position you prefer, over the cans put a layer of cloth, then a layer of cans. Fill the <implement>boiler</implement> in this manner, then cover the cans well with <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> place the <implement>boiler</implement> on the fire, and <emph rend="italic">boil</emph> three hours without ceasing. On steady boiling, depends much of your success. After boiling three hours, lift the <implement>boiler</implement> from the fire, let the <ingredient>water</ingredient> cool, then take the cans from the <implement>boiler</implement> and tighten, let them remain until cold, then tighten again. Wrap each can in brown paper to exclude the light, and keep in a cool dry cellar and be very sure the <implement>rubber</implement> rings are not hardened by use. The rings should be renewed every two years. I would advise the beginner to use new rings entirely, for poor rings cause the loss of canned <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> and vegetables in many cases. You will observe that in canning <ingredient>corn</ingredient> the cans are not wrapped in a cloth nor heated; merely filled with the cut <ingredient>corn.</ingredient> The <ingredient>corn</ingredient> in the cans will shrink considerably in boiling, but on no account open them after canning.</p></recipe>

The <ingredient>white of eggs</ingredient> is, perhaps, the best substance that can be employed in clarifying <ingredient>jelly,</ingredient> as well as some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen (and the <ingredient>white of eggs</ingredient> is nearly pure albumen) is put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances suspended in it, on boiling the liquid the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner, and, entangling with the impurities, rises with them to the surface as a scum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight.</p></recipe>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">FRENCH CREAM CANDY.</purpose>
Put four cupfuls of <ingredient>white sugar</ingredient> and one cupful of <ingredient>water</ingredient> into a bright tin pan on the range, and let it boil without stirring for ten minutes. If it looks somewhat thick, test it by letting some drop from the spoon, and if it threads, remove the pan to the table. Take out a small spoonful, and rub it against the side of a cake-bowl; if it becomes creamy, and will roll into a ball between, the fingers, pour the whole into the bowl. When cool enough to <ingredient>bear</ingredient> your finger in it, take it in your lap, stir or beat it with a large spoon, or <implement>pudding-stick.</implement> It will soon begin to look like <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and then grow stiffer until you find it necessary to take your hands and work it like <ingredient>bread dough</ingredient>. If it is not boiled enough to <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> set it back upon the range, and let it remain one or two minutes, or as long as is necessary, taking care not to cook it too much. Add the flavoring as soon as it begins to cool. This is the foundation of all French creams. It can be made into rolls, and sliced off, or packed in plates and cut into small cubes, or made into any shape imitating French candies. A pretty form is made by coloring some of the <ingredient>cream</ingredient> pink, taking a piece about as large as a hazel nut and crowding an <ingredient>almond meat</ingredient> half way into one side, till it looks like a bursting kernel.

If, after it is beaten, it does not look like <ingredient>lard</ingredient> or thick <ingredient>cream,</ingredient> and is sandy or sugary instead, it is because you did not let it get cool enough before beating.</p><p>It is not boiled enough if it does not harden so as to work like dough, and should not stick to the hands; in this case put it back into the pan with an ounce of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> and cook over just enough, by testing in <ingredient>water</ingredient> as above.

<section class1="beverages"><p>Boiling water is a very important desideratum in the making of a good cup of coffee or tea, but the average housewife is very apt to overlook this fact. Do not boil the water more than three or four minutes; longer boiling ruins the water for coffee or tea-making, as most of its natural properties escape by evaporation, leaving a very insipid liquid, composed mostly of lime and iron, that would ruin the best coffee, and give the tea a dark, dead look, which ought to be the reverse.</p><p>Water left in the tea-kettle over night <emph rend="italic">must never be used for preparing the breakfast coffee; </emph>no matter how excellent your coffee or tea may be, it will be ruined by the addition of water that has been boiled more than once.</p></section>
<section class1="beverages"><hd rend="bold" align="center">THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF TEA AND COFFEE.</hd><p>The medical properties of these two beverages are considerable. Tea is used advantageously in inflammatory diseases and as a cure for the headache. Coffee is supposed to act as a preventive of gravel and gout, and to its influence is ascribed the rarity of those diseases in France and Turkey. Both tea and coffee powerfully counteract the effects of opium and intoxicating liquors; though, when taken in excess, and without nourishing food, they themselves produce, temporarily at least, some of the more disagreeable consequences incident to the use of ardent spirits. In general, however, none but persons possessing great mobility of the nervous system, or enfeebled or effeminate constitutions, are injuriously affected by the moderate use of tea and coffee in connection with food.</p></section>

<section class1="medhealth"><p>Dishes for invalids should be served in the daintiest and most attractive way; never send more than a supply for one meal; the same dish too frequently set before an invalid often causes a distaste, when perhaps a change would tempt the appetite.</p><p>When preparing dishes where milk is used, the condition of the patient should be considered. Long cooking hardens the albumen and makes the milk very constipating; then, if the patient should be already constipated, care should be taken not to heat the milk above the boiling point.</p><p>The seasoning of food for the sick should be varied according to the condition of the patient; one recovering from illness can partake of a little piece of roast mutton, chicken, rabbit, game, fish, simply dressed, and simple puddings are all light food and easily digested. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed and broiled, is a dish that is often inviting to an invalid. As a rule, an invalid will be more likely to enjoy any preparation sent to him if it is served in small, delicate pieces. As there are so many small, dainty dishes that can be made for this purpose, it seems useless to try to more than give a small variety of them. Pudding can be made of prepared barley, or tapioca, well-soaked before boiling, with an egg added, and a change can be made of light puddings by mixing up some stewed fruit with the puddings before baking; a bread pudding from stale bread-crumbs, and a tiny cup-custard, boiled in a small basin or cup; also various drinks, such as milk punch, wine, whey, apple-toddy, and various other nourishing drinks.</p></section>

<section class1="medhealth"><hd rend="bold" align="center">HOW COLDS ARE CAUGHT.</hd><p>A great many cannot see why it is they do not take a cold when exposed to cold winds and rain. The fact is, and ought to be more generally understood, that nearly every cold is contracted indoors, and is not directly due to the cold outside, but to the heat inside. A man will go to bed at night feeling as well as usual and get up in the morning with a royal cold. He goes peeking around in search of cracks and keyholes and tiny drafts. Weather-strips are procured, and the house made as tight as a fruit-can. In a few days more the whole family has colds.</p><p>Let a man go home, tired or exhausted, eat a full supper of starchy and vegetable food, occupy his mind intently for a while, go to bed in a warm, close room, and if he doesn't have a cold in the morning it will be a wonder. A drink of whiskey or a glass or two of beer before supper will facilitate matters very much.</p><p>People swallow more colds down their throats than they inhale or receive from contact with the air, no matter how cold or chilly it may be. Plain, light suppers are good to go to bed on, and are far more conducive to refreshing sleep than a glass of beer or a dose of chloral. In the estimation of a great many this statement is rank heresy, but in the light of science, common sense and experience it is gospel truth.</p><p>Pure air is strictly essential to maintain perfect health. If a person is accustomed to sleeping with the windows open there is but little danger of taking cold winter or summer. Persons that shut up the windows to keep out the "night air" make a mistake, for at night the only air we breathe is "night air," and we need good air while asleep as much or even more than at any other time of day. Ventilation can be accomplished by simply opening the window an inch at the bottom and also at the top, thus letting the pure air in, the bad air going <pb n="432" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=456"/> outward at the top. Close, foul air poisons the blood, brings on disease which often results in death; this poisoning of the blood is only prevented by pure air, which enters the lungs, becomes charged with <emph rend="italic">waste</emph> particles, then thrown out, and which are poisoning if taken back again. It is estimated that a grown person corrupts <emph rend="italic">one gallon of pure air every minute,</emph> or twenty-five barrels full in a single night, in breathing alone.</p><p>Clothing that has been worn through the day should be changed for fresh or dry ones to sleep in. Three pints of moisture, filled with the waste of the body, are given off every twenty-four hours, and this is mostly absorbed by the clothing. Sunlight and exposure to the air purifies the clothing of the poisons which nature is trying to dispose of, and which would otherwise be brought again into contact with the body.</p><p>Colds are often taken by extreme cold and heat, and a sudden exposure to cold by passing from a heated room to the cold outside air. Old and weak persons, especially, should avoid such extreme change. In passing from warm crowded rooms to the cold air, the mouth should be kept closed, and all the breathing done through the nostrils only, that the cold air may be warmed before it reaches the lungs, or else the sudden change will drive the blood from the surface of the internal organs, often producing congestions.</p><p>Dr. B. I. Kendall writes that <emph rend="italic">"the temperature of the body</emph> should be evenly and properly maintained to secure perfect health; and to accomplish this purpose requires great care and caution at times. The human body is, so to speak, the most delicate and intricate piece of machinery that could possibly be conceived of, and to keep this in perfect order requires constant care. It is a fixed law of Nature that every violation thereof shall be punished; and so we find that he who neglects to care for his body by protecting it from sudden changes of weather, or draughts of cold air upon unprotected parts of the body, suffers the penalty by sickness, which may vary according to the exposure and the habits of the person, which affect the result materially; for what would be an easy day's work for a man who is accustomed to hard labor, would be sufficient to excite the circulation to such an extent in a person unaccustomed to work, that only slight exposure might cause the death of the latter when over-heated in this way; while the same exercise and exposure to the man accustomed to hard labor might not affect him. So, we say, be careful of your bodies, for it is a duty you owe to yourselves, your friends, and particularly to Him who created you. When your body is over-heated and you are perspiring, be very careful about sitting down to 'cool off,' as the custom of some is, by removing a part of the clothing and sitting in a cool place, and perhaps where there is a draught of air <pb n="433" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=457"/> passing over your body. The proper way to 'cool off' when over-heated is to put on more clothing, especially if you are in a cool place; but never remove a part of the clothing you have already on. If possible, get near a fire where there is no wind blowing, and <emph rend="italic">dry off</emph> gradually, instead of cooling off suddenly, which is always dangerous."</p><p>Many colds are taken from the feet being damp or wet. To keep these extremities warm and dry is a great preventative against the almost endless list of disorders which come from a "slight cold." Many imagine if their feet are not thoroughly wet, there will be no harm arising from mere dampness, not knowing that the least dampness is absorbed into the sole, and is attracted nearer the foot itself by its heat, and thus perspiration is dangerously checked.</p></section>
<section><hd rend="bold" align="center">WATER.</hd><p>All beings need drink as much as they need food, and it is just as necessary to health as pure air; therefore the water should be boiled or filtered before being drank. Rain-water filtered is probably the best attainable. Boiling the water destroys the vegetable and animal matter, and leaves the mineral matter deposited on the bottom of the vessel containing it; therefore it leaves it clear from poisonous substances.</p></section>
<section class1="medhealth"><hd rend="bold" align="center">REGULATION IN DIET.</hd><p>The food we eat is a very important item, and one which it would be difficult to arrange any rule for which would apply to all persons under different circumstances. In health, it is safer to eat by instinct rather than to follow any definite rules. While there are many who have a scanty living, with a small variety of food, there is a large number who have an abundance and a large variety. The former class, in many cases, live miserable lives, either to hoard up for miserly purposes the money which might make them happy, or in some cases through poverty; while the latter class, as a rule, have better health and have much more enjoyment in this life, unless it be some who are gluttonous, and make themselves miserable by abusing the blessings they should enjoy. Avoid extremes in living too free or scanty; have a good nourishing diet, and a sufficient quantity, and it should always be properly cooked; for if the cooking is poorly done, it affects not only the nutritious qualities, but is not so easily digested; thus making food, which is originally the best kind, of very little value to us; and with very poor cooking it is sometimes a positive injury.</p><p>It is very important that the food be taken with regularity at the accustomed time. Be careful not to take too much drink during any meal; but, if thirsty, drink water before meal-time so that you will not care for it until some time <pb n="434" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=458"/> after eating, as it is a bad plan to drink much either during or for a little time after the meal is taken. It is a very bad plan to hurry in eating, because by so doing the food is not properly masticated; it is better to be a long time in eating and chew the food well.</p><p><attribution align="right">--<emph rend="italic">Dr. B.

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">HOW TO USE HOT WATER.</purpose>
One of the simplest and most effectual means of relieving pain is by the use of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> externally and internally, the temperature varying according to the feelings of the patient. For bruises, sprains, and similar accidental hurts, it should be applied immediately, as hot as can be borne, by means of a cloth dipped in the <ingredient>water</ingredient> and laid on the wounded part, or by immersion, if convenient, and the treatment kept up until relief is obtained. If applied at once, the use of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> will generally prevent, nearly, if not entirely, the bruised flesh from turning black. For pains resulting from indigestion, and known as wind colic, etc., a cupful of <ingredient>hot water,</ingredient> taken in sips, will often relieve at once. When that is insufficient, a <implement>flannel</implement> folded in several thicknesses, large enough to fully cover the painful place, should be wrung out of <ingredient>hot water</ingredient> and laid over the seat of the pain. It should be as hot as the <ingredient>skin</ingredient> can bear without injury, and be renewed every ten minutes or oftener, if it feels cool, until the pain is gone. The remedy is simple, efficient, harmless, and within the reach of every one; and should be more generally used than it is. If used along with common sense, it might save many a doctor's bill, and many a course of drug treatment as well.</p></formula>

The best eye-wash for granulated lids and inflammation of the eyes is composed of <ingredient>camphor,</ingredient> <ingredient>borax</ingredient> and <ingredient>morphine</ingredient>, in the following proportions: To a large <ingredient>wine</ingredient>-glass of <ingredient>camphor water</ingredient>--not <ingredient>spirits</ingredient>--add two grains of morphine and six grains of borax. Pour a few drops into the palm of the hand, and hold the eye in it, opening the lid as much as possible. Do this three or four times in twenty-four hours, and you will receive great relief from pain and smarting soreness. This recipe was received from a celebrated oculist, and has never failed to relieve the most inflamed eyes.</p><p>Another remedy said to be reliable: A lump of <ingredient>alum</ingredient> as large as a <ingredient>cranberry</ingredient> boiled in a teacupful of <ingredient>sweet milk,</ingredient> and the curd used as a poultice, is excellent for inflammation of the eyes.</p><p>Another wash: A cent's worth of pure, refined <ingredient>white copperas,</ingredient> dissolved in a pint of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> is also a good lotion; but label it <emph rend="italic">poison,</emph> as it should never go near the mouth. Bathe the eyes with the mixture, either with the hands or a small piece of linen cloth, allowing some of the liquid to get under the lids.</p><p>Here is another from an eminent oculist: Take half an ounce of <ingredient>rock salt</ingredient> and one ounce of dry sulphate of zinc ; simmer in a clean, covered porcelain vessel with three pints of <ingredient>water</ingredient> until all are dissolved; strain through thick muslin; add one ounce of <ingredient>rose-water;</ingredient> bottle and cork it tight.

More than forty years ago, when it was found that prevention for the Asiatic cholera was easier than cure, the learned doctors of both hemispheres drew up a prescription, which was published (for working people) in <emph rend="italic">The New York Sun,</emph> and took the name of "<emph rend="italic">The Sun Cholera Mixture.</emph>" It is found to be the best remedy for looseness of the bowels ever yet devised. It is to be commended for several reasons. It is not to be mixed with liquor, and therefore will not be used as an alcoholic beverage. Its ingredients are well known among all the common people, and it will have no prejudice to combat; each of the materials is in equal proportions to the others, and it may therefore be compounded without professional skill; and as the dose is so very small, it may be carried in a tiny <implement>phial</implement> in the waistcoat pocket, and be always at hand. It is:</p><p>Take equal parts of <ingredient>tincture of cayenne,</ingredient> <ingredient>tincture of opium,</ingredient> <ingredient>tincture of rhubarb,</ingredient> <ingredient>essence of peppermint,</ingredient> and <ingredient>spirits of camphor.</ingredient> Mix well. Dose fifteen to thirty drops in a wine-glass of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> according to age and violence of the attack. Repeat every fifteen or twenty minutes until relief is obtained.

<section class1="household"><hd rend="bold" align="center">USES OF AMMONIA.</hd><p>All housekeepers should keep a bottle of liquid ammonia, as it is the most powerful and useful agent for cleaning silks, stuffs and hats, in fact cleans everything it touches. A few drops of ammonia in water will take off grease from dishes, pans, etc., does not injure the hands as much as the use of soda and strong chemical soaps. A spoonful in a quart of warm water for cleaning paint, makes it look like new, and so with everything that needs cleaning.</p><p>Spots on towels and hosiery will disappear with little trouble if a little ammonia is put into enough water to soak the articles, and they are left in it an hour or two before washing; and if a cupful is put into the water in which clothes are soaked the night before washing, the ease with which the articles can be washed, and their great whiteness and clearness when dried, will be very gratifying. Remembering the small sum paid for three quarts of ammonia of common strength, one can easily see that no bleaching preparation can be more cheaply obtained.</p><p>No articles in kitchen use are so likely to be neglected and abused as the dish-cloths and dish-towels; and in washing these, ammonia, if properly used, is a greater comfort than anywhere else. Put a teaspoonful into the water in which these clothes are, or should be washed every day; rub soap on the towels. Put them in the water; let them stand half an hour or so; then rub them out thoroughly, rinse faithfully, and dry out-doors in clear air and sun, and dish-cloths and towels need never look gray and dingy--a perpetual discomfort to all housekeepers.</p><p>A dark carpet often looks dusty soon after it has been swept, and you know it does not need sweeping again; so wet a cloth or a sponge, wring it almost dry, and wipe off the dust. A few drops of ammonia in the water will brighten the colors.</p> <pb n="451" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=475"/><p>For cleaning hair-brushes it is excellent; put a tablespoonful into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and down until clean; then dry with the brushes down, and they will be like new ones.</p><p>When employed in washing anything that is not especially soiled, use the waste water afterward for the house plants that are taken down from their usual position and immersed in the tub of water. Ammonia is a fertilizer, and helps to keep healthy the plants it nourishes. In every way, in fact, ammonia is the housekeeper's friend.</p><p>Ammonia is not only useful for cleaning, but as a household medicine. Half a teaspoonful taken in half a <implement>tumbler</implement> of water is far better for faintness than alcoholic stimulants. In the Temperance Hospital, in London, it is used with the best results. It was used freely by Lieutenant Greely's Artic party for keeping up circulation. It is a relief in nervousness, headache, and heart disturbances.</p></section>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO DESTROY INSECTS AND VERMIN.</purpose>
Dissolve two pounds of <ingredient>alum</ingredient> in three or four quarts of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> Let it remain over night, till all the <ingredient>alum</ingredient> is dissolved. Then, with a brush, apply, boiling hot, to every joint or crevice in the closet or shelves where croton bugs, ants, cockroaches, etc., intrude; also to the joints and crevices of bedsteads, as bed bugs dislike it as much as croton bugs, roaches, or ants. Brush all the cracks in the floor and mopboards. Keep it boiling hot while using.</p><p>To keep woolens and furs from moths, be sure that none are in the articles when they are put away; then take a piece of strong brown paper, with not a hole through which even a pin can enter. Put the article in it, with several lumps of <ingredient>gum camphor</ingredient> between the folds. Place this in a close box or trunk. Cover every joint with paper A piece of cotton cloth, if thick and firm, will answer. Wherever a knitting-needle can pass, the parent moth can enter.</p><p>Place pieces of <ingredient>camphor,</ingredient> cedar-wood, Russia leather, <ingredient>tobacco</ingredient>-leaves, whole <ingredient>cloves,</ingredient> or anything strongly aromatic, in the drawers or boxes where furs and other things to be preserved from moths are kept, and they will never be harmed. Mice never get into drawers or trunks where <ingredient>gum camphor</ingredient> is placed.</p><p><emph rend="italic">Another recipe:</emph>--Mix half a pint of <ingredient>alcohol,</ingredient> the same quantity of turpentine, and two ounces of <ingredient>camphor.</ingredient> Keep in a stone bottle, and shake well before using. The clothes or furs are to be wrapped in linen, and crumbled-up pieces of <implement>blotting-paper</implement> dipped in the liquid to be placed in the box with them, so that it smells strong. This requires renewing but once a year.</p><p>Another authority says that a positive, sure recipe is this: Mix equal quantities <pb n="452" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=476"/> of pulverized borax, <ingredient>camphor</ingredient> gum and <ingredient>saltpetre</ingredient> together, making a powder. Sprinkle it dry under the edges of carpets, in drawers, trunks, etc., etc. It will also keep out all kinds of insects, if plentifully used. If the house-keeper will begin at the top of her house with a powder <implement>bellows</implement> and a large quantity of this fresh powder, and puff it thoroughly into every crack and crevice, whether or not there are croton bugs in them, to the very bottom of her house, special attention being paid to old furniture, closets, and wherever croton <ingredient>water</ingredient> is introduced, she will be freed from these torments. The operation may require a repetition, but the end is success.</p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">MOTHS IN CARPETS.</purpose>
If you fear that they are at work at the edge of the carpet, it will sometimes suffice to lay a wet towel, and press a hot <implement>flat-iron</implement> over it; but the best way is to take the carpet up, and clean it, and give a good deal of attention to the floor. Look in the cracks, and if you discover signs of moths, wash the floor with benzine, and scatter <ingredient>red pepper</ingredient> on it before putting the carpet lining down.</p><p>Heavy carpets sometimes do not require taking up every year, unless in constant use. Take out the tacks from these, fold the carpets back, wash the floor in strong <ingredient>suds</ingredient> with a tablespoonful of borax dissolved in them. Dash with insect powder, or lay with <ingredient>tobacco</ingredient> leaves along the edge, and retack. Or use turpentine, the enemy of buffalo moths, carpet worms and other insects that injure and destroy carpets. Mix the turpentine with pure <ingredient>water</ingredient> in the proportion of three tablespoonfuls to three quarts of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and then after the carpet has been well swept, go over each breadth carefully with a sponge dipped in the solution and wrung nearly dry. Change the <ingredient>water</ingredient> as often as it becomes dirty. The carpet will be nicely cleaned as well as disinfected. All moths can be kept away and the <ingredient>eggs</ingredient> destroyed by this means. Spots may be renovated by the use of <ingredient>ox-gall</ingredient> or <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient> and <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p><p>A good way to brighten a carpet is to put a half <implement>tumbler</implement> of <ingredient>spirits of turpentine</ingredient> in a basin of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and dip your broom in it and sweep over the carpet once or twice, and it will restore the color and brighten it up until you would think it new. Another good way to clean old carpets is to rub them over with meal; just dampen it a very little and rub the carpet with it, and when perfectly dry, sweep over with meal. After a carpet is thoroughly swept, rub it with a cloth dipped in <ingredient>water</ingredient> and <ingredient>ammonia</ingredient>: it will brighten the colors and make it look like new.</p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO WASH FLANNELS.</purpose>
The first thing to consider in washing flannels so that they retain their size, is, that the article be <emph rend="italic">washed</emph> and <emph rend="italic">rinsed</emph> in <ingredient>water</ingredient> of the <emph rend="italic">same temperature,</emph> that is, about as warm as the hands can bear,and not allowed to cool between. The <ingredient>water</ingredient> should be a strong <ingredient>suds.</ingredient> Rub through two soapy waters; wring them out, and put into plenty of clear, clean, <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> to rinse. Then into another of the same temperature, blued a little. Wring, shake them well, and hang up. Do not take out of this <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> and hang out in a freezing air, as that certainly tends to shrink them. It is better to dry them in the house, unless the sun shines. They should dry <emph rend="italic">quickly.</emph> Colored flannels should never be washed in the same <ingredient>water</ingredient> after <ingredient>white</ingredient> clothes, or they will be covered, when dry, with lint; better be washed in a <ingredient>water</ingredient> for themselves. In washing worsted, such as merino dress goods, pursue the same course, only do not wring them hard; shake, hang them up and let drain. While a little damp, bring in and press smoothly on the wrong side with as hot an iron as can be used without scorching the goods.</p><p>Flannels that have become yellow from being badly washed, may be nicely whitened by soaking them two or three hours in a lather made of one-quarter of a pound of <ingredient>soft soap,</ingredient> two tablespoonfuls of powdered borax, and two tablespoonfuls of carbonate of <ingredient>ammonia,</ingredient> dissolved in five or six gallons of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO STARCH, FOLD AND IRON SHIRTS.</purpose>
To three tablespoonfuls of dry, fine <ingredient>starch</ingredient> allow a quart of <ingredient>water.</ingredient> First wet the <ingredient>starch</ingredient> smooth in a little <ingredient>cold water</ingredient> in a tin pan, put into it a little pinch of <ingredient>salt</ingredient> and a piece of enamel, or shirt polish, the size of a <ingredient>bean,</ingredient> or a piece of <ingredient>clean tallow,</ingredient> or a piece of <ingredient>butter</ingredient> the size of a <ingredient>cranberry;</ingredient> pour over this a quart of <emph rend="italic">boiling</emph> <ingredient>water,</ingredient> stirring rapidly, placing it over the fire. Cook until clear, then remove it from the fire and set the pan in another of <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> to keep the <ingredient>starch</ingredient> warm.</p><p>Turn the shirt wrong side out and dip the bosom in the hot <ingredient>starch</ingredient> as warm as the hands can bear the heat; rub the <ingredient>starch</ingredient> evenly through the linen, saturating it thoroughly; wring hard to make dry as possible. <ingredient>Starch</ingredient> the collar and wristbands the same way; then hang them out to dry. Three hours before ironing them, wet the bosoms and cuffs in <ingredient>cold water,</ingredient> wring out, shake and fold, roll up tightly, wrap in a towel and let remain two or three hours.</p><p>The back of the shirt should be ironed first by doubling it lengthwise through the centre, the wristbands may be ironed next, and both sides of the sleeves; <pb n="454" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=478"/> then the collar band; now place a <implement>bosom board</implement> under the bosom and with a fresh clean napkin dampened a little, rub the bosom from the top towards the bottom, arranging and smoothing each plait neatly; then with a smooth, moderately hot <implement>flat-iron,</implement> begin ironing from the top downward, pressing hard until the bosom becomes smooth dry and glossy. Remove the <implement>bosom board</implement> and iron the front, fold both sides of the shirt towards the centre of the back, fold together below the bosom and hang on the bars to air.</p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO CLEAN BLACK LACE. No. I.</purpose>
A teaspoonful of <ingredient>gum arabic,</ingredient> dissolved in one teacupful of <ingredient>boiling water;</ingredient> when cool, add half a teaspoonful of black ink; dip the lace and spread smoothly between the folds of a newspaper and press dry with book or the like. Lace shawls can be dressed over in this way, by pinning a sheet to the carpet, and stretching the shawl upon that; or black lace can be cleaned the same as ribbon and silk. Take an old kid glove (black preferable), no matter how old, and boil it in a pint of <ingredient>water</ingredient> for a short time; then let it cool until the leather can be taken in the hand without burning; use the glove to sponge off the ribbon; if the ribbon is very dirty, dip it into <ingredient>water</ingredient> and draw through the fingers a few times before sponging. After cleaning, lay a piece of paper over the ribbon, and iron; paper is better than cloth. The ribbon will look like new.</p></formula>

Black laces of all kinds may be cleaned by <ingredient>alcohol.</ingredient> Throw them boldly into the liquid; <implement>churn</implement> them up and down till they foam; if very dusty, use the second dose of <ingredient>alcohol;</ingredient> squeeze them out, "spat" them, pull out the edges, lay them between brown paper, smooth and straight; leave under a heavy weight till dry; do not iron.</p></formula>
<formula class="household"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO WASH WHITE LACE. No. I.</purpose>
First, the soiled laces should be carefully removed from the garment and folded a number of times, keeping the edges evenly together, then basted with a coarse thread without a knot in the end. Now put them in a basin of luke-warm <ingredient>suds.</ingredient> After soaking a half hour, rub them carefully between the hands, renewing the <ingredient>suds</ingredient> several times; then, after soaping them well, place them in <pb n="455" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=479"/><emph rend="italic">cold</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> and let them come to a scald.

Now roll them in a clean, fresh towel without taking out the bastings; let them lie for an hour or more; iron over several thicknesses of <implement>flannel,</implement> taking out the bastings of one piece at a time, and ironing on the wrong side, with a moderately hot iron; the laces should be nearly dry, and the edges and points pulled gently with the fingers into shape, before ironing.</p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO CLEAN SILKS OR RIBBONS.</purpose>
Half a pint of <ingredient>gin,</ingredient> half a pound of <ingredient>honey,</ingredient> half a pound of <ingredient>soft soap,</ingredient> one-eighth of a pint of <ingredient>water.</ingredient></p><p>Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen table or <implement>dresser,</implement> and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels of <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and down in each vessel, but do not wring it; and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite <ingredient>clean water</ingredient> for the last dip. Hang it up dripping for a minute or two, then dab in a cloth, and iron it quickly with a very hot iron.</p><p>Where the lace or silk is very much soiled, it is best to pass them through a warm liquor of bullock's <ingredient>gall</ingredient> and <ingredient>water;</ingredient> rinse in <ingredient>cold water;</ingredient> then take a small piece of <ingredient>glue,</ingredient> pour <ingredient>boiling water</ingredient> on it, and pass the veil through it; clap it, and frame to dry.

<formula class="household"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO CLEAN BLACK DRESS SILKS.</purpose>
One of the things "not generally known," at least in this country, is the Parisian method of cleaning black silk; the <emph rend="italic">modus operandi</emph> is very simple, and the result infinitely superior to that achieved in any other manner. The silk must be thoroughly brushed and wiped with a cloth, then laid flat on a board or table, and well-sponged with hot <ingredient>coffee,</ingredient> thoroughly freed from sediment by being strained through muslin. The silk is sponged on the side intended to show; <pb n="456" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=480"/> it is allowed to become partially dry, and then ironed on the wrong side. The <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> removes every particle of <ingredient>grease,</ingredient> and restores the brilliancy of silk, without imparting to it either the shiny appearance or crackly and papery stiffness obtained by <ingredient>beer,</ingredient> or, indeed, any other liquid. The silk really appears thickened by the process, and this good effect is permanent. Our readers who will experimentalize on an apron or cravat, will never again try any other method.</p></formula>
<formula class="household"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">TO WASH FEATHERS.</purpose>
Wash in warm <ingredient>soap-suds</ingredient> and rinse in <ingredient>water</ingredient> a very little blued; if the feather is white, then let the wind dry it. When the curl has come out by washing the feather or getting it damp, place a hot <implement>flat-iron</implement> so that you can hold the feather just above it while curling. Take a bone or silver knife, and draw the fibres of the feather between the thumb and the dull edge of the knife, taking not more than three fibres at a time, beginning at the point of the feather and curling one-half the other way. The hot iron makes the curl more durable. After a little practice one can make them look as well as new feathers. Or they can be curled by holding them over the stove or range, not near enough to burn; withdraw, and shake out; then hold them over again, until they curl. When swansdown becomes soiled, it can be washed and look as well as new. Tack strips on a piece of muslin and wash in <ingredient>warm water</ingredient> with <ingredient>white soap,</ingredient> then rinse and hang in the wind to dry. Rip from the muslin, and rub carefully between the fingers to soften the leather.</p></formula>
<formula class="household"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">INCOMBUSTIBLE DRESSES.</purpose>
By putting an ounce of <ingredient>alum</ingredient> or <ingredient>sal ammoniac</ingredient> in the <emph rend="italic">last</emph> <ingredient>water</ingredient> in which muslins or cottons are rinsed, or a similar quantity in the <ingredient>starch</ingredient> in which they are stiffened, they will be rendered almost uninflammable; or, at least, will with difficulty take the fire, and if they do, will burn without flame. It is astonishing that this simple precaution is so rarely adopted. Remember this and save the lives of your children.</p></formula>

Furs when taken out in the fall are often found to have a mussed, crushed out appearance. They can be made to look like new, by following these simple directions: Wet the fur with a hair-brush, brushing up the wrong way of the fur. Leave it to dry in the air for about half an hour, and then give it a good beating on the right side with a <implement>rattan.</implement> After beating it, comb it with a coarse-comb, combing up the right way of the fur.</p></formula>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">NOVEL DRESS MENDING.</purpose>
A novel way of mending a woolen or silk dress in which a round hole has been torn, and where only a patch could remedy matters, is the following: The frayed portions around the tear should be carefully smoothed, and a piece of the material, moistened with very thin mucilage, placed under the hole. A heavy weight should be put upon it until it is dry, when it is only possible to discover the mended place by careful observation.</p></formula>

less conveniences, but these articles, if they can be purchased in the commencement of housekeeping, will save time and labor, making the preparation of food more easily--and it is always economy in the end to get the best material in all wares--as, for instance, the double plate tin will last for years, whereas the poor kind has to be replaced in a short time; the low-priced earthenware is soon broken up, whereas the strong <implement>stone ware,</implement> costing but a trifle more, lasts almost a lifetime.</p><p>In relation to the economy and management of the kitchen, I might suggest that the most essential thing is cleanliness in cooking, and also cleanliness with your person as well as in the keeping of the kitchen.</p> <pb n="492" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=516"/><p>The hands of the cook should be always thoroughly cleansed before touching or handling anything pertaining to the cooking. Next there should never be any wasted or thrown away that can be turned to account, either for your own family or some family in poor circumstances. Bread that has become hard can be used for toasting, or for stuffing and pudding. In warm weather any gravies or soups that are left from the preceding day should be boiled up and poured into clean pans. This is particularly necessary where vegetables have been added to the preparation, as it then so soon turns sour. In <implement>cooler</implement> weather, every other day will be often enough to warm up these things.</p><p>In cooking, clear as you go; that is to say, do not allow a host of basins, plates, spoons, and other utensils, to accumulate on the dressers and tables whilst you are engaged in preparing the dinner. By a little management and forethought, much confusion may be saved in this way. It is as easy to put a thing in its place when it is done with, as it is to keep continually moving it to find room for fresh requisites. For instance, after making a pudding, the flour-tub, <implement>paste-board,</implement> and rolling-pin, should be put away, and any basins, spoons, etc., should be neatly packed up near the sink, to be washed when the proper time arrives. Neatness, order, and method should be always observed.</p><p>Never let your stock of spices, salt, seasonings, herbs, etc., dwindle down so low that some day, in the midst of preparing a large dinner, you find yourself minus a very important ingredient, thereby causing much confusion and annoyance.</p><p>After you have washed your sauce-pans, <implement>fish-kettle,</implement> etc., stand them before the fire for a few minutes to get thoroughly dry inside, before putting them away. They should then be kept in a dry place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust, and thereby be quickly destroyed. Never leave sauce-pans dirty from one day's use to be cleaned the next; it is slovenly and untidy.</p><p>Do not be afraid of hot water in washing up dishes and dirty cooking utensils. As these are essentially greasy, lukewarm water cannot possibly have the effect of cleansing them effectually. Do not be chary also of changing and renewing the water occasionally. You will thus save yourself much time and labor in the long run.</p><p>Keep a cake of sapolio always on hand in the kitchen--always convenient for rubbing off stains, from earthenware, tin, glass, in fact, almost every thing but silver; it is a cheap and valuable article, and can be purchased at nearly every grocery in the United States.</p></section>

<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold" size="larger">Small Points on Table Etiquette.</purpose>
Delicacy of manner at table stamps both man and woman, for one can, at a glance, discern whether a person has been trained to eat well--<emph rend="italic">i.e.</emph> to hold the knife and fork properly, to eat without the slightest sound of the lips, to drink quietly, to use the napkin rightly, to make no noise with any of the implements <pb n="497" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=521"/> of the table, and last, but not least, to eat slowly and masticate the food thoroughly. All these points should be most carefully taught to children, and then they will always feel at their ease at the grandest tables in the land. There is no position where the innate refinement of a person is more fully exhibited than at the table, and nowhere that those who have not been trained in table etiquette feel more keenly their deficiencies. The knife should never be used to carry food to the mouth, but only to cut it up into small mouthfuls; then place it upon the plate at one side, and take the fork in the right hand, and eat all the food with it. When both have been used finally, they should be laid diagonally across the plate, with both handles towards the right hand; this is understood by well-trained waiters, to be the signal for removing them, together with the plate.</p><p>Be careful to keep the mouth shut closely while masticating the food. It is the opening of the lips which causes the smacking which seems very disgusting. Chew your food well, but do it silently, and be careful to take small mouthfuls. The knife can be used to cut the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> finely, as large pieces of <ingredient>meat</ingredient> are not healthful, and appears very indelicate. At many tables, two, three or more knives and forks are placed on the table, the knives at the right hand of the plate, the forks at the left,--a knife and a fork for each course, so that there need be no replacing of them after the breakfast or dinner is served. The smaller ones, which are for <ingredient>game,</ingredient> dessert, or for hot cakes at breakfast, can be tucked under the edges of the plate, and the large ones, for the <ingredient>meat</ingredient> and vegetables, are placed outside of them. Be very careful not to clatter your knives and forks upon your plates, but use them without noise. When you are helped to anything, <emph rend="italic">do not</emph> wait until the rest of the company are provided, it is not considered good breeding. When passing the plate for a second helping, lay them together at one side of the plate, with handles to the right. Soup is always served for the first course, and it should be eaten with dessert spoons, and taken from the sides, not the tips of them, without any sound of the lips, and not sucked into the mouth audibly from the ends of the spoon. Bread should not be broken into soup or <ingredient>gravy.</ingredient> Never ask to be helped to soup a second time. The hostess may ask you to take a second plate, but you will politely decline. <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> chowder, which is served in soup plates, is said to be an exception which proves this rule, and when eating of that it is correct to take a second plateful, if desired.</p><p>Another generally neglected obligation is that of spreading <ingredient>butter</ingredient> on one's <ingredient>bread</ingredient> as it lies in one's plate, or but slightly lifted at one end of the plate; it is very frequently buttered in the air, bitten in gouges, and still held in the face and eyes of the table with the marks of the teeth on it. This is certainly not <pb n="498" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=522"/> altogether pleasant, and it is better to cut it, a bit at a time, after buttering it, and put piece by piece in the mouth with one's finger and thumb. never help yourself to <ingredient>butter,</ingredient> or any other food with your own knife or fork. It is not considered good taste to mix food on the same plate. <ingredient>Salt</ingredient> must be left on the side of the plate and never on the table-cloth.</p><p>Let us mention a few things concerning the eating of which there is sometimes doubt. A cream-cake and anything of similar nature should be eaten with knife and fork, never bitten. <ingredient>Asparagus</ingredient>--which should be always served on <ingredient>bread</ingredient> or <ingredient>toast,</ingredient> so as to absorb, superfluous moisture--may be taken from the finger and thumb; if it is fit to be set before you, the whole of it may be eaten. Pastry should be broken and eaten with a fork, never cut with a knife. Raw <ingredient>oysters</ingredient> should be eaten with a fork, also <ingredient>fish.</ingredient> <ingredient>Peas</ingredient> and <ingredient>beans</ingredient>, as we all know, require the fork only; however, food that cannot be held with a fork should be eaten with a spoon. <ingredient>Potatoes</ingredient>, if mashed, should be mashed with the fork. Green <ingredient>corn</ingredient> should be eaten from the <ingredient>cob;</ingredient> but it must be held with a single hand.</p><p><ingredient>Celery,</ingredient> cresses, <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> <ingredient>radishes,</ingredient> and relishes of that kind are, of course, to be eaten with the fingers; the <ingredient>salt</ingredient> should be laid upon one's plate, not upon the cloth. <ingredient>Fish</ingredient> is to be eaten with the fork, without the assistance of the knife; a bit of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> in the left hand sometimes helps one to master a refractory morsel. Fresh <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> should be eaten with a silver bladed-knife, especially <ingredient>pears,</ingredient> <ingredient>apples,</ingredient> etc.</p><p><ingredient>Berries,</ingredient> of course, are to be eaten with a spoon. In England they are served with their hulls on, and three or four are considered an ample quantity. But then in England they are many times the size of ours; there they take the big <ingredient>berry</ingredient> by the stem, dip into <ingredient>powdered sugar,</ingredient> and eat it as we do the <ingredient>turnip radish.</ingredient> It is not proper to drink with a spoon in the cup; nor should one, by-the-way, ever quite drain a cup or glass.</p><p>Don't, when you drink, elevate your glass as if you were going to stand it inverted on your nose. Bring the glass perpendicularly to the lips, and then lift it to a slight angle. Do this easily.</p><p>Drink sparingly while eating. It is far better for the digestion not to drink <ingredient>tea</ingredient> or <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> until the meal is finished. Drink gently, and do not pour it down your throat like <ingredient>water</ingredient> turned out of a pitcher.</p><p>When seating yourself at the table, unfold your napkin and lay it across your lap in such a manner that it will not slide off upon the floor; a gentleman should place it across his right knee. Do not tuck it into your neck,like a child's bib. For an old person, however, it is well to attach the napkin to a napkin hook and <pb n="499" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=523"/> slip it into the vest or dress buttonholes, to protect their garments, or sew a broad tape at two places on the napkin, and pass it over the head. When the soup is eaten, wipe the mouth carefully with the napkin, and use it to wipe the hands after meals. Finger bowls are not a general institution, and yet they seem to be quite as needful as the napkin, for the fingers are also liable to become a little soiled in eating. They can be had quite cheaply, and should be half-filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and placed upon the side table or butler's tray, with the dessert, <ingredient>bread</ingredient> and <ingredient>cheese,</ingredient> etc. They are passed to each person half-filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> placed on a parti-colored napkin with a dessert plate underneath, when the dessert is placed upon the table. A leaf or two of sweet verbena, an <ingredient>orange flower,</ingredient> or a small  of <ingredient>lemon,</ingredient> is usually put into each bowl to rub upon the fingers. The  of <ingredient>lemon</ingredient> is most commonly used. The finger tips are slightly dipped into the bowl, the <ingredient>lemon juice</ingredient> is squeezed upon them, and then they are dried softly upon the napkin. At dinner parties and luncheons they are indispensable.</p><p>Spoons are sometimes used with firm puddings, but forks are the better style. A spoon should never be turned over in the mouth.</p><p>Ladies have frequently an affected way of holding the knife half-way down its length, as if it were too big for their little hands; but this is as awkward a way as it is weak; the knife should be grasped freely by the handle only, the fore finger being the only one to touch the blade, and that only along the back of the blade at its root, and no further down.</p><p>At the conclusion of a course, where they have been used, knife and fork should be laid side by side across the middle of the plate--never crossed; the old custom of crossing them was in obedience to an ancient religious formula. The servant should offer everything at the left of the guest, that the guest may be at liberty to use the right hand. If one has been given a napkin ring, it is necessary to fold one's napkin and use the ring; otherwise the napkin should be left unfolded. One's teeth are not to be picked at table; but if it is impossible to hinder it, it should be done behind the napkin. One may pick a bone at the table, but, as with <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> only one hand is allowed to touch it; yet one can usually get enough from it with knife and fork, which is certainly the more elegant way of doing; and to take her teeth to it gives a lady the look of caring a little too much for the pleasures of the table; one is, however, on no account to suck one's finger after it.</p><p>Wherever there is any doubt as to the best way to do a thing, it is wise to follow that which is the most rational, and that will almost invariably be found to be proper etiquette. To be at ease is a great step towards enjoying your own <pb n="500" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=524"/> dinner; and making yourself agreeable to the company. There is a reason for everything 
in polite usage; thus the reason why one does not blow a thing to cool it,it is not only that it is an inelegant and vulgar action intrinsically, but because it may be offensive to others--can not help being so, indeed; and it, moreover implies haste, which, whether from greediness or a desire to get away, is equally objectionable. Everything else may be as easily traced to it's origin in the fit and becoming.</p><p>If, to conclude, one seats one's self properly at table, and takes reason into account, one will do tolerably well. One must not pull one's chair too closely to the table, for the natural result of that is the inability to use one's knife and fork without inconveniencing one's neighbors; the elbows are to be held well in and close to one's side, which cannot be done if the chair is too near the board. One must not lie or lean along the table, nor rest one's arms upon it. Nor is one to touch any of the dishes; if a member of the family, one can exercise all the duties of hospitality through servants, and wherever there are servants, neither family nor guests are to pass or help from any dish. Finally, when rising from your chair leave it where it stands.</p></formula>

<formula class="etiquette"><p>
<purpose align="center" placement="heading" rend="bold">THE LAYING OF THE TABLE AND THE TREATMENT OF GUESTS.</purpose>
In giving "dinners," the apparently trifling details are of great importance when taken as a whole.</p><p>We gather around our board agreeable persons, and they pay us and our dinner the courtesy of dressing for the occasion, and this reunion should be a time of profit as well as pleasure. There are certain established laws by which "dinner giving" is regulated in polite society; and it may not be amiss to give a few observances in relation to them. One of the first is that an invited guest should arrive at the house of his host at least a quarter of an hour before the time appointed for dinner. In laying the table for dinner <emph rend="italic">all</emph> the linen should be a spotless white throughout, and underneath the linen table-cloth should be spread one of thick cotton-<implement>flannel</implement> or <implement>baize,</implement> which gives the linen a heavier and finer appearance, also deadening the sound of moving dishes. Large and neatly <pb n="501" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=525"/> folded napkins (ironed without <ingredient>starch</ingredient>), with pieces of <ingredient>bread</ingredient> three or four inches long, placed between the folds, but not to completely conceal it, are laid on each plate. An ornamental centre-piece, or a vase filled with a few rare flowers, is put on the centre of the table, in place of the large table-<implement>castor,</implement> which has gone into disuse, and is rarely seen now on well-appointed tables. A few choice flowers make a charming variety in the appearance of even the most simply laid table, and a pleasing variety at table is quite an essential to the enjoyment of the repast as is a good choice of dishes, for the eye in fact should be gratified as much as the palate.</p><p>All dishes should be arranged in harmony with the decorations of the flowers, such as covers, relishes, confectionary, and small sweets. Garnishing of dishes has also a great deal to do with the appearance of a dinner-table, each dish garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd.</p><p>Beside each palate should be laid as many knives, forks, spoons as will be required for the several courses, unless the hostess prefers to have them brought on with each change. A glass of <ingredient>water,</ingredient> and when <ingredient>wine</ingredient> is served glasses for it, and individual <ingredient>salt</ingredient>-cellars may be placed at every plate. Water-bottles are now much in vogue with corresponding <implement>tumblers</implement> to cover them; these, accompanied with dishes of broken ice, may be arranged in suitable places. When <ingredient>butter</ingredient> is served a special knife is used, and that, with all other required service, may be left to the judgement and taste of the hostess, in the proper placing of the various aids to her guests' comfort.</p><p>The <implement>dessert plates</implement> should be set ready, each with a <implement>doily</implement> and a <implement>finger-glass</implement> partly filled with <ingredient>water,</ingredient> in which is dropped a slice of <ingredient>lemon;</ingredient> these, with extra knives, forks and spoons, should be on the <implement>side-board</implement> ready to be placed by the guest, between the courses when required.</p><p>If preferred, the "dinner" may all be served from the side-table, thus relieving the host from the task of carving. A plate is set before each guest, and the dish carved is presented by the waiter on the left-hand side of each guest. At the end of each course the plates give way for those of the next. If not served from the side-table, the dishes are brought in ready to be carved, and placed before the host and hostess, then served and placed upon the waiter's <implement>salver,</implement> to be laid by that attendant before the guest.</p><p>Soup and <ingredient>fish</ingredient> being the first course, plates of soup are usually placed on the table before the dinner is announced; or if the hostess wishes the soup served at the table, the <implement>soup-tureen,</implement> containing <emph rend="italic">hot</emph> soup, and the <emph rend="italic">warm</emph> <implement>soup-plates</implement> are placed before the seat of the hostess. Soup and <ingredient>fish</ingredient> being disposed of, then come the joints or roasts, <emph rend="italic">entr&#233;es</emph> (made dishes), poultry, etc., also relishes.</p> <pb n="502" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=526"/><p>After dishes have been passed that are required no more, such as vegetables, hot sauces, etc., the dishes containing them may be set upon the <implement>side-board,</implement> ready to be taken away.</p><p><ingredient>Jellies</ingredient> and sauces, when not to be eaten as a dessert, should be helped on the dinner-plate, not on a small side dish as was the former usage.</p><p>If a dish be on the table, some parts of which are preferred to others, according to the taste of the individuals, all should have the opportunity of choice. The host will simply ask each one if he has any preference for a particular part; if he replies in the negative, you are not to repeat the question, nor insist that he must have a preference.</p><p>Do not attempt to eulogize your dishes, or apologize that you cannot recommend them,--this is extreme bad taste; as also is the vaunting of the excellence of your wines, etc., etc.</p><p>Do not insist upon your guests partaking of particular dishes. Do not ask persons more than once, and never force a supply upon their plates. It is ill-bred, though common, to press any one to eat; and moreover, it is a great annoyance to many.</p><p>In winter, plates should always be warmed, but not made hot. Two kinds of animal food, or two kinds of dessert, should not be eaten off of one plate, and there should never be more than two kinds of vegetables with one course. <ingredient>Asparagus</ingredient>, green <ingredient>corn,</ingredient> <ingredient>cauliflower</ingredient> and raw <ingredient>tomatoes,</ingredient> comprise one course in place of a salad. All <ingredient>meats</ingredient> should be cut across the grain in very thin slices. <ingredient>Fish,</ingredient> at dinner, should be baked or boiled, never fried or broiled. Baked <ingredient>ham</ingredient> may be used in every course after <ingredient>fish,</ingredient> sliced thin and handed after the regular course is disposed of.</p><p>The hostess should retain her plate, knife and fork, until her guests have finished.</p><p>The crumb-brush is not used, until the preparation for bringing in the dessert; then all the glasses are removed, except the flowers, the water-<implement>tumblers,</implement> and the glass of <ingredient>wine</ingredient> which the guest wishes to retain with his dessert. The <implement>dessert plate</implement> containing the <implement>finger-bowl,</implement> also a dessert knife and fork, should then be set before each guest, who at once removed the <implement>finger-bowl</implement> and its <implement>doily,</implement> and the knife and fork to the table, leaving the plate ready to be used for any dessert chosen.</p><p>Finely sifted <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> should always be placed upon the table to be used with puddings, pies, <ingredient>fruit,</ingredient> etc., and if <ingredient>cream</ingredient> is required, let it stand by the dish it is to be served with.</p><p>To lay a dessert for a small entertainment, and a few guests outside of the <pb n="503" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=527"/> family, it may consist simply of two dishes of fresh <ingredient>fruit</ingredient> in season, two of <ingredient>dried fruits</ingredient> and two each of cakes and <ingredient>nuts.</ingredient></p><p><ingredient>Coffee</ingredient> and <ingredient>tea</ingredient> are served <emph rend="italic">lastly</emph>, poured into tiny cups and served clear, passed around on a tray to each guest, then the <ingredient>sugar</ingredient> and <ingredient>cream</ingredient> passed, that each person may be allowed to season his black <ingredient>coffee</ingredient> or <emph rend="italic">caf&#233; noir</emph> to suit himself.</p><p>A <emph rend="italic">family dinner</emph>, even with a few friends, can be made quite attractive and satisfactory without much display or expense; consisting first of good soup, then <ingredient>fish</ingredient> garnished with suitable additions, followed by a roast; then vegetables and some made dishes, a salad, <ingredient>crackers,</ingredient> <ingredient>cheese</ingredient> and <ingredient>olives,</ingredient> then dessert.

BY INATIUS DONNELLY. One volume, square 12mo, $2.00. With numerous illustrations.</p><p>This work consists of a chain of arguments and facts to prove that the Drift Age, with its vast deposits of clay and gravel, its decomposed rocks, and its great rents in the face of the globe, was the result of contact between the earth and a comet; that man lived on the earth at that time; that he was highly civilized; that all the human family, with the exception of a few persons who saved themselves in caves, perished from the same causes which destroyed the mammoth and the other pre-glacial animals; that the legends of all the races of the world preserve reference to and descriptions of this catastrophe; that following it came a terrible age of ice and snow, of great floods while the clouds were restoring the waters to the sea, and an age of darkness while the dense clouds infolded the globe. These startling ideas are supported by an array of scientific facts, and by legends drawn from all ages and all regions of the earth. A purely scientific work, but as fascinating as any work of fiction.</p><p>"The book will be read with curious interest by the learned, and, though it draws perpetually on the treasures of scientific and ethnic lore, the unlearned will pore over its pages with eagerness and delight.* * * 'Ragnar&#246;k' is a strong and brilliant literary production, which will command the interest of general readers and the admiration and respect of the conservative and the scientific."- Professor ALEXANDER WINCHELL, <emph rend="italic">in the Dial.</emph></p><p>"It is a bold enterprise, and its very boldness, gives it a peculiar fascination.

Published and sold for the benefit of Mrs. Logan. </p><p>"The Volunteer Soldier of America" is a most thoughtful and scholarly treatment of a great subject. There is hardly a chapter in the book in which the volunteer soldier- not always as an individual, but as representative of the great defense and life of the Republic- does not appear in a glowing light. The book will continue popular with the American people when the "dime-novel" war literature is forgotten.

BY R.W. THOMPSON, Ex-Secretary of the Navy. One volume, 8vo, 546 pages, $2.50</p><p>The only complete work on the subject. The standard for reference. This book has been written from a non-partisan standpoint, in order to furnish accurate information about our tariff laws to all classes of readers. Its main object is to show that protection to manufacturing enterprise, as the only means of creating home markets and securing proper reward to domestic industry and labor, was from the beginning of the Government a positive necessity, and yet is; that without it our vast natural resources could not have been developed ; and that, if it were abandoned, those now engaged in manufactures would be compelled to cultivate the soil, which, by over-production of agricultural products, would glut our markets, reduce prices, and make us dependent upon Great Britain. It gives, as its title suggests, an outline of Protective Tariff Legislation, and of the position of every leading statesman of all parties on the subject from the formation of our Government to the present time.</p><p>"Its value grows upon me, and I trust it may have a wide and general circulation as a fair statement of the question of protection, especially as to the effect upon and benefit to the people of the United States."- JOHN SHERMAN, <emph rend="italic">U.S. Senate.</emph></p><p>"The treatment of the early history of the tariff, in this book, is by far the most comprehensive and effective that has yet been written, and cannot fail to interest all who desire to understand its origin and growth. It is an admirable exposition of the views of the fathers of the Republic, and of all our Presidents, down to and including General Jackson. The argumentative part is strong and convincing. No one can read it impartially and escape the conclusion that it is on the side of the truth, reason, and patriotism."- EDWARD H.AMMIDOWN, <emph rend="italic">President of American Protective Tariff League.</emph></p><p>THE STORY OF MANUAL LABOR IN ALL AGES. {underline} BY JOHN C. SIMONDS. One volume, octavo, $2.75. Illustrated with portraits and colored diagrams.</p><p>A history of the world on an entirely original plan, with special reference to the conditions surrounding the toilers of all times. A complete pen picture of the wage-worker from a social, political and economical standpoint, together with a full history of trades-unions, guilds and labor associations. We venture the assertion that in no other book can be found information so extensive and peculiar. The author says in his preface:</p><p>"Of late a change has overtaken the Muse of History. Interest has been awakened not in the General, but in 
the Soldier 
; not in the King, but in the Subject ; not in the Noble, but in the Peasant. Thoughtful men are now asking, What of the artisan ? What of the mechanic ? What of the farmer ? Information is not wanted of mighty Caesar, but of the Roman populace he secretly despised. The minds of the men are no longer bewitched by the genius of Napoleon ; all eyes are now turned to the Third Estate, and to that proletariat that shattered one of the most hoary and brilliant monarchies of Europe, and shook the political foundations of the old world to the very center.</p><p>" Our book is a response to this change in public opinion. * * * There is not a similar book in the English Language, and it may be said, indeed, in any language. It will tell the story of the farmer, of the artisan, of the mechanic, of the wage-worker, in every country and epoch. It will speak of his political relations to the State, his position in the social order; of his work and how it was performed; of his home, his family, his food, his raiment ; in brief, we will attempt the history of those who 'earned their bread in the sweat of their faces;' of how they lived, toiled, suffered, and died. We have essayed to do for those nameless heroes of all times- those masses of the people that have fought <pb n="4" id="/projects/cookbooks/coldfusion/display.cfm?ID=whit&#38;PageNum=550"/> the battles, builded the cities, and wrought the fabric of civilization, what has already been done for the monarch, the warrior, the nobleman and statesman."</p><p>THE NATIONAL CYCLOPAEDIA. {underline} A Dictionary of Useful and Practical Information for the Farm, Home and School. BY HON. JONATHAN PERIAM. Three volumes, imperial octavo, $12.75. Profusely illustrated.</p><p>The standard reference for the farmer, the stock-raiser, the housekeeper, and on all subjects connected with the farm, home and school. The London <emph rend="italic">Morning Post, </emph> the great conservative newspaper of England, says of it: "It is a scandal and a shame that we in this country have no work that can be placed beside it." J.C. McMullin, Vice-President of the Chicago &#38; Alton Railroad Company, who has justly earned the reputation of being one of the most astute railroad managers in the United States, says :</p><p>"I have examined the National Cyclopaedia carefully. * * * While it is particulary useful to the agriculturist and the stockman, it is not less so to railway and professional men as a reference book."</p><p>While the value of this work to the partical agriculturist is apparent at a glance, we take particular pride in calling attention to Mr. McMullin's opinion, which is corroborated by many eminent lawyers and other professional men, who find it indispensable in their libraries.</p><p>WILD BEASTS, BIRDS AND REPTILES OF THE WORLD: {underline} The Story of their Capture. BY P.T. BARNUM. One volume, quarto, profusely illustrated, $3.50.</p><p>A great work on Natural History in the form of an exciting narrative of travel and adventure. Fascinating and instructive. The crowning work of the great showman's life. The illustrations are by the best artists of Europe and America. It is the cheapest illustrated work ever published, and its merits are attested by unprecedented popularity.</p><p>THE WHITE-HOUSE COOK BOOK.{underline} BY MRS. L.F. GILLETTE. One volume, quarto, $2.00.</p><p>The latest, largest and most complete of all Cook Books. The result of forty years of practical housekeeping. Its simple methods of explanation enable the most inexperienced to clearly comprehend it. The pages are broad, and when the book is opened it will stay open, so that frequent reference can be made to it without the trouble of opening it every time. This is, without doubt, the most easily sold of all books carried by agents. We would advise any agent who is trying to sell an unsuccessful book to try the White-House Cook Book. It sells at sight, and succeeds where all others fail.</p><p>For the above and other standard works we want a responsible, energetic agent in every town and township, and to such we offer liberal terms, and guarantee profitable employment and exclusive territory.</p><p align="right">R.S.
